Yaya Bey,Ten Fold,8.3,Pop/R&B,"Losing someone close to you can feel like a rupture in time. How can the sun continue to rise? How can the world keep moving? The disorientation of being fundamentally altered in grief motivates Yaya Bey’s transcendent new album, Ten Fold. “My nigga left the world and the world ain’t stop,” she quietly raps on “yvette’s cooking show.” The Queens-raised artist recorded the album in the year following the death of her father, Ayub Bey—the emcee and producer Grand Daddy I.U., who was a member of the pioneering hip-hop collective Juice Crew and a towering figure in Bey’s life. Funeral costs compelled her to keep working and over the course of a year, she made music without any firm plans. The results, whittled down to 16 tracks, are snapshots of an artist moving through loss as she navigates financial and emotional precarity and the vicissitudes of romance. It’s a finely detailed portrait of grief that also celebrates the fullness of life. The ripples of Yaya Bey’s day-to-day are small, but in her delicate hands, they are strikingly resonant. Ten Fold rarely dwells on the past, choosing instead to mark the passage of time by cataloging the feelings that sprouted along the way—sadness, defiance, joy, frustration, pride, love. Masterful sequencing and economical writing (most songs are under three minutes) allow Bey to be as nimble as ever. After announcing the grief that “weighs heavy” on her, she briskly wipes her tears to celebrate her blooming potential on the pocket-disco song “chrysanthemums.” She finds “fly shit” at the thrift store on “east coast mami” to project the confidence needed to make power moves. Relationships fizzle and grow; rent remains too damn high. Collectively, the album sounds like a Black woman just trying to get by. In keeping with her 2022 breakout album, Remember Your North Star, Bey pulls from the warmer colors of a Black musical palette—Soulquarians-style neo-soul, upbeat funk, house, and boom bap. The production, assisted by Corey Fonville of the genre-melding jazz-hop band Butcher Brown, feels cozy and self-soothing. She taps into familiarity, yet resists complacency. The album opens with the simmering melancholy of “crying through my teeth,” which like its spiritual ancestor “Didn’t Cha Know,” carries a world of feeling in the simplest of phrases. Where songs like “nobody knows” on North Star described vivid characters and scenes, Ten Fold’s stories are abstract, unfolding like an extended inner monologue. The spare house beat of “sir princess bad bitch” is demo-like, and its circular refrain (“The beautiful thing about me/Is every little beautiful thing/Is on its way to me”) sounds like the kind of made-up song you sing to keep yourself afloat. Directing the affirmations inward allows Bey to skillfully sidestep platitudes: feelings arise spontaneously and inconstantly from all across the emotional spectrum. Even the songs explicitly about other people feel insular, like the blooming romance of “slow dancing in the kitchen.” The sunny reggae cut has the gossamer quality of a daydream or a gaze directed toward a lover. Self-love is a prominent lyrical theme, but its greatest manifestation is how Bey handles her voice. In her idiosyncratic tone, there are glimmers of the open-throated soul-jazz of Anita Baker, yet what sets her apart from her peers and foremothers in R&B is her quieter, more intimate approach. What she lacks in vocal pageantry, she makes up for in her stylistic range—singing, rapping, scatting, and humming. On the modern blues of “the evidence,” she reaches for the lowest notes of her range to scrape up the courage to “hold on,” communicating the enormous effort with just a gravelly hum. On the lighter love songs, like the wah-wah funk of “all around los angeles,” high notes abound, soft as cotton candy. Her father Ayub’s voice is laced throughout the album, appearing via voice notes and samples. But it’s only in the final minutes, on “yvette’s cooking show,” that she addresses him directly. Over a simple piano loop, she speaks to her father in present tense, wishing him absolution and catching him up on the latest year of her life. She finally shines a light on the father-shaped hole at the center of the album, the one she’s been sketching around with all the quotidian details. Suddenly, everything we’ve heard prior has a different ring to it. Still, this revelation doesn’t feel like avoidance: It illuminates the transitory nature of grief, how it can come and go like everything else. Embracing that impermanence, which Ten Fold shows really means embracing all of life, points a way out of the pain. By the time she reaches the last song, “let go,” the question is no longer if the pain can be let go, but when. The question remains unanswered: Only time will tell.

YhapoJJ,P.S. Fuck You,6.9,Rap,"Yhapojj has the kind of outsized persona where he takes on the identity of a wolf, is anointed to knighthood via sword emojis in TikTok comments, and has a show shut down by NYPD—only to take the music into the streets and the skate park. Since 2020, he’s been triangulating his sound, somewhere between Isley Brothers, ILoveMakonnen, and Bangerz-era Miley Cyrus. On P.S. Fuck You, the 20-year-old Huntsville, Alabama rapper comes back down to Earth with a vulnerable and sometimes silly project that’s ultimately sort of fun but not that deep. Alongside teenage phenom Nettspend, Yhapojj has popularized “jerk” rap, a genre known for pitched-up, layered vocals and bass that will make your speakers sound broken. With many of jerk rap’s major players barely beyond their teens, its lyrics tend to capture classic adolescent attitudes like “no one understands me,” “I need her so bad,” and “let’s get fucked up tonight.” Yhapojj’s fans admire his combination of sad, crooning lyrics over loud, kinetic beats. Call it crying while acing your math exam, but that duality is foundational to P.S. Fuck You, where Yhapojj weaves between blaring horns, melodic piano, and thick bass as he reflects on his relationships and mindset.On the standout “Turnin Lane,” produced by Charlotte, North Carolina’s ok, Yhapojj ruminates about a lover he doesn’t want to leave, asking her which way she’s going to go in the turn lane—as well as complimenting her feet. He’s trying to convince us that he doesn’t care, but the song’s anxious desperation betrays him. Atop a triumphant horn-filled beat on “Feelings,” Yhapojj hopes all his friends get married—if only so he gets a chance to see his crush at the reception, which is sweet in a rom-com type of way. His change of vocal effects and the tone of his voice create different versions of Yhapojj to represent different parts of his personality. His delivery has a mountain of charisma to stand on, but a lack of musical variety is what really drags P.S. Fuck You down. The album features work by a number of young producers, like Atlanta’s FearDorian and jerk rap beatmaker Hhhcra, but it starts to run out of gas towards the end, and piano-based tracks like “Whats Up Wit” and “Touch Evb” blend together. While Yhapojj has used angel or werewolf imagery to create a hyperreal version of himself that made zany music, P.S. Fuck You portrays him as just a guy going through it. It feels raw and complex, but it leaves you hoping for just a touch more magic.",0,"May 20, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yhapojj-ps-fuck-you/
Chat Pile,Cool World,7.7,Rock,"Studies have shown that increased physical distance from a person depletes our capacity for empathy towards them. But you don’t need a research paper to prove it. Ever shouted at a reckless driver from the armored confines of your car? Ever watched from the heights of a skyscraper as tiny, faceless masses scramble below? Have you struggled to see each one as an individual, harboring their very own passions and resentments? On their excellent 2022 debut God’s Country, Oklahoma City sludge-metal quartet Chat Pile rejected that bird’s-eye indifference. They clocked their subjects at an uncomfortably close range, observing the horrors of opioid addiction, the screams of slaughtered livestock, an amateur armed robbery, their gruesome proximity an antidote to detached isolation. Some of the microscopic detail was scraped from surfaces in the band members’ own lives, particularly industrial pollution within their home state; their very namesakes are giant mounds of toxic detritus that loom over an abandoned Oklahoma mining town. God’s Country read like a registry of dejected lives in the Southern Plains. On their second album, Cool World, Chat Pile retreats from the tight zoom on their immediate surroundings, widening their lens to capture humanity’s collective violence. “Part of me doesn’t want people to think of Oklahoma as the armpit of the world,” lead singer ​​Raygun Busch said in a recent interview. “The world is full of armpits.” The four-piece also broadens their approach sonically, incorporating mid-tempo metal, gothic new wave, and ’90s alternative into the pummeling noise they mastered on their first record. Their experiments across genre still sound muscular, but occasionally lack the urgent ferocity Chat Pile captured on God’s Country. And while Cool World’s panoramic view of human suffering can sometimes get a little blurry, its best songs still channel the band’s gift for heft and lurid specificity. With its winding pace and pile-driving guitar, the mucky “Milk of Human Kindness” is far more indebted to Sweet Oblivion-era Screaming Trees than any punk or metal progeny. As it oozes along, bassist Stin—his tone knob cranked to the max—plucks notes that rattle like window panes on the verge of imploding. Busch holds a distance here that leaves you craving the point-blank inspection of older songs, but he still injects details that grab you by the head and force you to look closer. “I screamed about it all night,” he drones, drafting a vague image that is sharpened by a harrowing second stroke: “I’d heard nothing about the way they burn.” Companion tracks “Camcorder” and “Tape” give a distant and grainy impression of violence. The former is cold and removed, trudging along with the sinister pace of Michael Myers. Busch sings of a shadowy evil whose shape isn’t totally clear, something that might have been finely fleshed-out on God’s Country. But his final reaction to this nebulous malignancy, “let’s watch it again,” is efficient in its brevity. This simple, open-ended phrase, sung with Busch’s trademark dread, suggests a sick delight in voyeurism—that what we are willfully watching is too sick to describe, but too intriguing to ignore. “Tape” is more formally and texturally rich, with a pulsing, choppy beat and a bassline that nods to Metallica’s indelible “Enter Sandman” riff. Busch screams tightly-worded verses, the flesh from his throat shredding off the muscle. “They made tapes!” he shouts. “It was the worst I ever saw.” Here, the song’s omitted details are doing the heavy lifting; you might picture some hideous snuff film, or news clips from Cambodia circa 1973. Although Cool World doesn’t stomp with the same weight of God’s Country, Chat Pile’s stylistic experiments pay off. “Funny Man,” for example, opens with a storm of mine-blasting drums and leaded bass that could rip through a Glenn Branca piece. Then, as if bursting from the Trojan Horse, it morphs into articulate, melodic rock; Busch sings with a sharp and breathless cadence that trips along like certain strains of Modest Mouse. Busch dealt in concise brutality on God’s Country, but on “Funny Man” he flexes a more poetic and abstract grasp on language: I broke my knees upon the pearl and onyxIn the hall of trophies built to honor my fatherSpilled the blood, gave ’em as much as they wantedStill had to dance for my supperStill had to give them my body With its cinematic verses and high-wire leaps from no-wave to tweaked-out indie to hardcore, “Funny Man” represents the pinnacle of Chat Pile’s explorative potential. Busch has explained that the song is about “being a servant, indentured or otherwise,” but it also suggests the corporeal price of wealth, and the generational trauma of those who bled for it. Chat Pile know that no matter where you’re from, all blood leaves the same stain. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Nídia,Estradas,7.8,Electronic / Experimental,"It’s not easy to tell who’s doing what on “Mata,” one of the highlights of Nídia and Valentina Magaletti’s debut album together. Neither artist has attempted a collaboration quite like this before, and perhaps that’s why it’s so propulsive. Beatmaker Nídia has never worked with a prominent multi-instrumentalist providing raw material on the fly; drummer Magaletti doesn’t typically work within a dance music context, especially not one like Nídia’s. In “Mata,” their scuffed congas, bongos, and synths go scrambling around the beat, alive with the anticipation of how they might interlock next. You can hear the two artists pushing each other as they meet in the middle. Raised between Bordeaux and her birthplace of Vale da Amoreira, in the greater Lisbon region, Nídia has moved outward from her roots in the Lisbon scene’s continuum of diasporic sounds, like kuduro and tarraxinha, from Lusophone Africa. Since emerging on SoundCloud as a teenager and joining the label Príncipe Discos, she’s put her spin on tracks from Fever Ray, Yaeji, and Kelela and mingled with a wide sweep of global party sounds to demonstrate just how far she can take her beats without losing her signature flair. The Italy-born, London-based Magaletti is similarly prolific on a different circuit: Whether she’s making post-hardcore with Moin, tight psychedelic jams with Tomaga, or her anthological solo projects, her unassuming but versatile approach treats percussion as a “narrative” in which each new breakbeat or clattering found object is a natural—and functional—rhythmic choice. Nídia and Valentina have been leaning in parallel directions lately. Nídia’s 2023 album 95 MINDJERES brought her strain of batida into a looser, more open-ended mode, uncannily approximating the improvisational feel of a live band with her laptop-producer chops. Meanwhile, a recent project by Magaletti’s dub band Holy Tongue with Shackleton spotlights the way dance music’s constraints can give a performer’s off-kilter textural idea the freedom to take root and evolve across an extended beat. Nídia and Magaletti’s collaborative debut, Estradas, gets a lot out of its setup. Each track is built out of shifting polyrhythms that they compose together: Magaletti plays various instrumental lines to make up the beats, while Nídia contributes her own programmed loops. The frothy MIDI snap of Nídia’s earlier projects gives way to a rigorous studio mix courtesy of Magaletti’s Moin bandmate Tom Halstead, with each instrument dutifully mic’d up and given space. When it’s played straight, adapting Nídia-style dance beats to an aesthetic closer to Raime can feel gratuitous, like those blown-out remixes of popular songs you hear in movie trailers. But the ensemble-oriented presentation helps the duo pull off some new tricks. The dour, rigid bass of “Nasty” seems to physically rattle the shakers with its pulse, calling back to ’80s industrial bands like 23 Skidoo, who laced dependable grooves with their own exploratory percussion. As “Estradas” marches forward, its beat wobbles between deliberate open rolls and sample-pack fingersnaps, like a ceremonial drum corps featuring DJ Mustard. A breezy guitar melody chugs against a familiar pocket on “No Promises,” but all the different drums are rendered in such overpowering detail that the song’s rhythmic coherence seems liable to burst open; the boundaries between Nídia’s and Magaletti’s respective performances and the post-production work that melds them together get murkier the closer you listen. Although the duo’s schematic experiments can leave the album feeling scattershot, their personalities shine in tandem throughout. The claps and hand drums on “Rapido” spring furiously to life with the gravitas of one of Magaletti’s bands on stage, but their force is focused and accelerated by the playful loop-tinkering that powers a Nídia track. Magaletti plays an implacable timbre that sounds like air buzzing through a flute, but might also pass for the scrape of a washboard. A moaning vocal sample that would fit on an earlier Nídia release catches on itself amid the thrum, as if to insist that the players are at once uninhibited and totally in control. It’s all weird and immediate enough to make sense for both artists—you could work “Rapido” into a DJ set with music from Nídia and her peers, or from Valentina and hers. Together they’ve continued to make music that’s irreducible to just one sensibility, inventory of sounds, or rhythmic framework. Play it loud, and get jolted by all the quirks.",0,"September 20, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nidia-and-valentina-estradas/
Mercury Rev,Born Horses,4.5,Rock,"Let’s raise a glass to the big swing, and let’s pour some out for missed targets. Mercury Rev’s first studio album of original material in nine years is that rare thing: a work that doubles, even quadruples down on a weird idea, defying marketability or even legibility. The band wrote and recorded Born Horses, mixed and mastered it, then released it, all of which constitutes brash commitment to the bit. There’s something admirable in the fact that it exists, for these are the materials from which cults are built—not the white-robes-and-passing-comets variety but the kind that rescues lost objects and redefines them as precious. Is Born Horses fated to become a cult obsession? This is the second time they’ve taken such a risk. After the commercial failure of their third album, 1995’s See You on the Other Side, Mercury Rev effectively broke up and reunited as a very different band under the same name. Jettisoning the punk-derived riffs and blasts of distortion that had defined their music, they adopted a weird pastoralia, indulging whims both folksy and cinematic, earthy and magical; Deserter’s Songs, their unexpected comeback, sounded like a transmission from a haunted forest. It was a huge, potentially alienating gamble, but it paid off beautifully and revitalized the band for the new millennium. Perhaps that’s what Jonathan Donahue and Sean “Grasshopper” Mackowiak hoped to achieve when they made Born Horses, which attempts a much less dramatic transformation and fails spectacularly. It began when Donahue stepped up to the microphone and started singing. Instead of the high, hollow rasp that has become his trademark since Deserter’s Songs, what came out of his mouth was deeper and throatier—something closer to speaking than singing. They wrote new songs to that new sound, penning lyrics that self-consciously come across like poetry to be recited. The band has cited composer Tony Conrad, poet Robert Creeley, and the Blade Runner soundtrack as inspirations, but Born Horses sounds more like The Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy or the albums of Rod McKuen, the pop-poet of the 1960s and ’70s who was the Thomas Kinkade of his medium. This unusual palette is startling at first, and potentially compelling as a hook upon which to hang an album. It could be something that jolts pop music in a different direction, or at least expands indie rock to incorporate a new set of reference points. But it doesn’t. Weirdly, these songs aren’t quite weird enough. Mercury Rev have never been shy about embracing kitsch, but Born Horses reins in some of their more eccentric impulses, even as it indulges new musical ones. Every song is about just what its title says it’s about. “Mood Swings” is about how Donahue has mood swings. On “Patterns” he notices patterns in everyday life, and isn’t that something? On “Ancient Love” he celebrates a love so old that it’s ancient. Throughout Born Horses, Donahue repeatedly presents himself as a bird. He knows why the caged bird sings. There’s a bird that lives in his chest. Every song sounds like a first draft, juvenile and solipsistic where it’s supposed to be open-hearted and gracious. You long for an inscrutable turn of phrase or a nugget of truly bizarre imagery, anything to disrupt the constant outpouring of Trapper Keeper poetry. The music ought to help counterbalance or at the very least excuse these lyrics, but it does not. Mercury Rev have created so many otherworldly symphonies in the past, but there’s very little of their previous ingenuity or vision on Born Horses. Everything shimmers and sparkles in roughly the same way, with very little to distinguish one song from the next. “Mood Swings” has a muted trumpet that could have been quoted from a B-movie about beatniks, but the song is so saturated in reverb that the instrument barely registers. There are what sound like nods to Yanni at the Acropolis on the title track and to Liberace’s opulence on “Your Hammer, My Heart”; such outré touchstones could have been a lot of fun. But there’s no sense of play in the music, which means there’s no grandeur to these songs. That seems to be the missing ingredient here, and possibly the thing that separates the band’s inspiring triumphs from its tragic flops: a true sense of wonder. Here’s my favorite moment on Born Horses. On closer “There’s Always Been a Bird in Me,” Donahue delivers this stunner: “People always say to me, they always say, ’‘Hey! What’s your bird’s name?’ And I say, ‘You and I. YOU. AND. I.’” He’s so serious and so sincere when he speaks those lines, betraying no humor but also no self-awareness. I’ve played this song many times just to hear that beautifully ridiculous moment, which means I’ve spent a lot more time with it than I’ve spent with the stupidly ridiculous “Woman’s World” or the toxically ridiculous “I Had Some Help.” This is exciting bad. The rest is not exciting at all. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

SOPHIE,SOPHIE,6.8,Electronic,"Before her untimely death in 2021, SOPHIE had rebooted the possibilities of pop at least twice. First with a visionary run of singles that wriggled and sizzled into your brain like nothing else, but also with the occult-industrial complexity of Coil, the boundless glee of Missy Elliott, the impish troll value of prime Aphex Twin, and the clarion indomitable glamor of Rihanna. Second, with Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides, a concise epic of humane transhumanism anthems, SOPHIE’s political and aural identities made flesh. Then there were dozens, maybe hundreds of other tracks. Some were rumored for other artists or an album called Trans Nation. More were previewed on HEAV3N, the 2020 livestream that was set to raise funds for Black trans and queer femmes before getting inexplicably banned from Twitch and later uploaded to YouTube. Thickets were uploaded to various Reddit and YouTube channels of varying reliability. But SOPHIE was always working. When she died, her Oil follow-up was said by her family to be close enough to finished to have a final tracklisting. “All the layers within each song were already there in some form,” her brother and studio manager, Benny Long, told The New York Times. And so he and her family—in what must have been a heartbreaking, complex, and hopefully healing process—finished SOPHIE. Here, then, is a unusually safe statement from one of the 21st century’s great risk-takers. In terms of sonic swerves, SOPHIE offers elegant integrations of the last 40 years of dance music into softer versions of her bang-whizz-zoom constructions; in terms of ideas, it leaves behind the body-mod complexity in favor of hard-won bodily pleasure. As a legacy product, it justly preserves these 16 songs, some of which are as good as anything she’s ever done. But it’s hard not to wonder if this is really it. Part of the issue is structural. SOPHIE is roughly comprised of four sections of four tracks each, with the strangest works up front. The Badalamenti-esque “Intro (The Full Horror)” plumes into the blunted “RAWWWWWW” and then a pair of ambient/spoken word curiosities: “Plunging Asymptote” welds a phrase from multi-disciplinary artist Juliana Huxtable onto a brutal bit of machinery that threatens to lead the way into a new world like Drexciya, but doesn’t really go anywhere. There’s also the spacier “The Dome’s Protection,” in which Nina Kraviz intones some stuff about time travel which doesn’t quite dispel the specter of other things she’s said. It’s tempting to imagine the sequencing as a queering of tradition, with an opening section of mostly noise and spoken-word sci-fi ruminations to preemptively drag any worries of “the difficult second album” syndrome. Yet it’s also structured in the standard dance music “big night out” mix, with an ambient beginning, vocal pop warmup, deep and drugged-out techno center, and blissed-out sendoff. SOPHIE could sequence in every sense of the word, but SOPHIE feels preprogrammed. It’s a feeling reinforced by the grouping of various tracks made with the same collaborators. Maybe this is a way of emphasizing her belief in them; maybe it’s like a runway show, when a designer sends all the yellow dresses out together. Somehow, it sets them into competition. Take the second side’s bunch of BC Kingdom collabs. Each takes on the kind of syncopated organ base which has been a dance-pop building block since at least “Show Me Love.” “Reason Why” is the trap-pop version, “Live In My Truth” rings out with early 2000s R&B sass, and “Why Lies” brings a freestyle beat to the party. Lined up in a row, you sort of just want to pull one off the stage with a big hook. “Live In My Truth” is all party-hearty aphorisms and, listen: The stakes of celebrating are too often life-and-death for queer, and especially trans, people. Sometimes we get eye-watering monuments to resilience and joy on a track like “Immaterial.” Here, it’s just a hand raising up a Solo cup. But the candy-coated joie de vivre of “Why Lies” is undeniable, with lyrics like “Please save the drama for your mama/And your daddy/And your granny” that are so dumb you just have to sing along. As for the glistening if sluggish “Reason Why” and Kim Petras’ “getting money like a DJ” line, not so much. SOPHIE’s brother has said that the album’s techno center was largely created live, like a DJ making mixes. It sounds that way. If SOPHIE’s best work often played like it was beamed fully from her brain, tracks like “Elegance” and “One More Time,” both featuring Popstar, show their hand much more—their BPMs slide around, their beats crossfade, they represent the long tradition of knob twiddling. Tracks also look back: “Gallop” is a little gabba gem for the generations of girlies who won’t slow down, while “Berlin Nightmare” frets and struts like prime Green Velvet. I guess we’ll never know if these moments were her laying breadcrumbs of early influences on her path to somewhere new, or just the pleasure of remembering. Time will tell if any of them are as memorable as, say, “Ponyboy.” But the closing set returns to some treasured partnerships, like getting home from the club and tumbling into bed with old friends. “Exhilarate” is a triumph of Kate Bush toms and fluttering vocal runs. “Always and Forever” flies Hannah Diamond’s sing-song melody into clouds pigmented with sunset tones, raindrop percussion, and dusky rumbles. It’s simple and eternal. Closer “Love Me Off Earth” swaps out, say, the fuschia vertigo of “ELLE” for rosegold floatation; it’s a kind of settling in, not settling for. And it’s fitting that the album’s best track boasts SOPHIE’s best collaborator, the hugely underrated singer and songwriter Cecile Believe. “My Forever” is a melancholy midtempo stunner, a bit of sophisti-pop with phrases that cleverly turn on their political implications. “Everybody wants to be somebody,” Believe sings. “Everybody’s got to own their body.” These days, neither is promised, and both are worth the fight. If SOPHIE had lived, maybe there would be a way to hear the chorus without her. “I want to go back to forever,” Believe sings. Back, maybe, to a time whose endpoint wasn’t already determined. Maybe there would be a way to hear Believe sing “You’ll always be my forever” and not think she was singing to SOPHIE. Singing along to SOPHIE feels reverent, a way to reckon with a loss whose full scope we’ll never know. Another way to honor her legacy might be to make your own album from what she left behind, a hundred different records in a hundred different forms. To trouble the idea of a “final statement” the same way SOPHIE troubled pop. SOPHIE isn’t a third reboot; it’s more like a patch for an album undone. Now, it’s for the rest of us to get to work.

Latto,Sugar Honey Iced Tea,6.1,Rap,"Is Sugar Honey Iced Tea a thinly veiled backronym directed at a fellow female rapper? Not according to Latto: “This is something that just felt Southern to me,” she demurred last month. Mirroring this brand-friendly regionalism, Sugar is built around aggressively adequate Atlanta trap anthems and functionally anonymous readymades that only occasionally reflect the full force of Latto’s talent. These songs do not demand to be played—they ask not to be skipped. This is particularly frustrating given the strength of Latto’s singles over the past year. While her biggest hits to date are the wedding-ready pop confection “Big Energy” and last summer’s Jung Kook collaboration “Seven,” Latto has simultaneously been cutting some of her toughest tracks ever, popping out with newcomer Anycia on “Back Outside” and threatening to pull up with “20 black Suburbans” full of goons on “Sunday Service.” Latto has said Sugar Honey Iced Tea was inspired by her 2023 song “Put It on Da Floor,” which “sparked a whole new energy for me as an artist.” Yet both “Put It on Da Floor” and “Sunday Service” are relegated to bonus track status (alongside their star-studded remixes). That energy is sorely missed: When Sugar Honey Iced Tea tries to come across brusque and threatening on would-be Playboi Carti song “Blick Sum,” it feels silly rather than savage. Silly isn’t a terrible look for Latto, whose simple rhymes are often delivered with an exaggerated wink. Take “Brokey,” where she says she’s sick of Givenchy Shark Lock boots (“Y’all burnt ’em out”), or the Young Nudy-assisted standout “Shrimp & Grits,” which kicks off, “Squirting on a nigga, he drinking my piss/Freak bitch, make him swallow my spit.” She rarely drops proper nouns, zoomed in on cash, carats, and an amorphous array of men eager to please. And although she’s quick to tease a hater that their boyfriend could be hers, Latto’s raps stay playful enough that even when she tosses off a line like “Body count so low, I might say I’m a virgin,” it scans as sardonic rather than slut-shaming. But long stretches of Sugar Honey Iced Tea are devoid of Latto’s peculiar charms. Tracks with Coco Jones and Teezo Touchdown could blend into any major label rap release; album outro “S/O to Me” aspires to be corny like Drake and sort of succeeds. Uglier still is a raft of populist tracks aimed at Top 40 and Rap Caviar. The former include Ciara feature “Good 2 You,” which exists, and a Megan Thee Stallion collaboration that manages to sound like a K-pop B-side without involving a single pop artist; the latter include the ponderous “Settle Down” and lackluster cuts like “Liquor” and “H&M,” where Latto’s impassioned vocals can’t fully zhuzh up run-of-the-mill beats. These lowest-common-denominator plays are a slog on an already too-long album. Even when the album drags, you’re never far from a reminder that Latto is a capable writer with dazzling star wattage. Especially exciting are “Copper Cove,” with Hunxho, and “Look What You Did,” with Mariah the Scientist; Latto’s singing is unexpectedly smooth, and her take on the romantic rap song comes through endearingly cheesy and nontoxic. She deftly balances sweet nothings with nonchalant shit-talk, knocking it out the park over the stadium organ dirge of “There She Go” as she scowls, “Girl, that shit don’t match your legs, where you get that ass from?” The head-and-shoulders highlight is “Big Mama,” where Latto moodily lists off her birthday wishlist, crooning that she needs good dick, oral sex, a pink Glock with a drummm. Then, as she deliriously chants about the state of her undergarments, the instrumental pump fakes and minor key piano spirals in: “Love when he call me Big Mama, yeah, that get the coochie wet/Ho better stick to TikTokin’, mean that with all disrespect.” Cadences kick into overdrive, Latto’s flow pivoting from jerky (“Money long, cheetah thong, thick as hell, Georgia Dome”) to fluid (“Bitch, I don’t play for the Nets, but I’m gon’ shoot shit up ’bout Brooklyn”) and back again. It’s a brief flash of greatness on an album overwhelmingly satisfied with the mundane.",0,"August 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/latto-sugar-honey-iced-tea/
Trent Reznor,Challengers (Original Score),7.2,Rock / Experimental,"At a recent premiere of Challengers, journalists stopped Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the red carpet to ask them about the score, their latest in a stellar run that began in 2010 with The Social Network, and which has bagged them two Academy Awards so far. “We’re used to the world of being in a band where we can control everything and we’re the bosses,” Reznor said. “Working in film, it’s interesting and it’s fun because we’re not the boss, we’re working in collaboration and in partnership with the director.” Reznor said this coyly, as if the theme of control—having it, wanting it, giving it up—hasn’t been central to his art for decades. Before Ross came on board, Nine Inch Nails was Reznor’s solo act dressed up as a band. He was notoriously detail-oriented, insisting on total creative oversight of things the label would usually handle, like artwork and music videos. Dominance and servitude have been a recurring theme in Nine Inch Nails’ lyrics since “Head Like a Hole,” the first track of their first album. That one was written when Reznor was broke, in his early twenties, and working as a janitor in a recording studio so he could make his own demos after hours. Some 30 years later, things are different. Reznor is a cult hero, an industry darling, and just a Tony away from an EGOT. Somehow, the man whose most famous lyric is “I wanna fuck you like an animal” ended up scoring a film for Disney—and winning an Oscar for it. If the first act of Reznor’s career was defined by him being the boss, the second has shown him either sharing creative agency or letting others take the lead. Appropriately, Ross and Reznor’s latest score is for a film largely about control and being controlled. Challengers is directed by Luca Guadagnino, the master of slow-boil eroticism who gave us Call Me By Your Name and Bones and All (also scored by Ross and Reznor). Zendaya plays Tashi Duncan, a tennis star turned coach who spends the movie’s decade-plus storyline as a puppet master to her two suitors, besties turned rivals Art Donaldson (Mike Faist) and Patrick Zweig (Josh O’Connor). After luring them into a three-way kiss in the hotel room scene you see in the trailer, she leans back and watches with a smirk as they make out with each other, then tells them she’ll give her number to whoever wins the next day’s tournament. She dates Zweig, but it fizzles when he balks at the idea of letting her guide his career. Donaldson is a more willing subject. She becomes his coach after an injury ends her own tennis career, and they end up married with a kid and appearing together in Aston Martin ads, a tennis power couple with her at the helm. The story’s climax and central storyline revolves around a match between Zweig and Donaldson that she’s slyly choreographed, and in which she’s dangled herself as the prize—stakes that suit her only by guaranteeing a bit of really, really good tennis. Challengers is invariably described as hot, sexy, steamy, etc., but there is almost no actual sex in it. The erotic charge comes mostly from Zendaya’s character and the power she has over these two men, on and off the tennis court. The movie’s tagline could have come straight from “Head Like a Hole”: “Bow down before the one you serve.” Like Donaldson, Reznor and Ross thrive by following instructions, giving us something Reznor acknowledges he probably wouldn’t have thought to do. “Luca said, ‘What if all the music was driving, thumping techno, like a heartbeat that makes the movie fun?’” he recalled. “I don’t know that we would have landed on that on our own.” True to Guadagnino’s brief, Challengers (Original Score) offers a smorgasbord of thumping club sounds, from electroclash (“Yeah x10”) to synth-pop to fast and functional techno. Each one feels like a dutiful genre exercise, but with a sonic signature that that is unmistakably Reznor and Ross’, especially in the way instruments like piano and guitar gel so elegantly with synths and drum machines. The music works brilliantly in the film, driving the action as much as it follows it, less a backdrop than a bold counterpoint to what’s on screen. Take, for instance, the moment when kick drums start pounding during a dorm-room argument. Or, more generally, the idea of rave music as the soundtrack to a tennis dramedy, a pairing that works so well you probably wouldn’t notice how counterintuitive it actually is. Much like their music for The Social Network, Ross and Reznor’s score opens dimensions to the film that might not have been visible otherwise. Almost every review of Challengers has praised the score specifically—even, in the case of the BBC, when they’re panning the film itself. Ross and Reznor’s past soundtracks, however inspired, have never quite worked as albums outside the context of their respective films. The music on Challengers stands up on its own better than any music from their other scores, but the record as a whole still has a lumpiness that's symptomatic of the format, with many tracks clocking in at less than three minutes and some appearing and reappearing in multiple versions. Evidently wise to this concern, Ross and Reznor hired the German DJ and producer Boys Noize to create a supplementary mixed (and remixed) version of the OST—no mean feat given the dramatic range in tempos, but one he handles with flair, creating a tight half hour of party rockers, dusted with samples of rackets thwacking and sneakers squeaking on clay. Boys Noize’s mix weaves it all together into a smooth, dynamic arc, and delivers a far more interesting version of “Compress / Repress,” lobbing in some gabber flourishes that shouldn’t work but absolutely do. “Compress / Repress,” co-written with Guadagnino and sung by Reznor, is one instance where the shared artistic control gets confusing. Historically, Reznor has lent his voice to music that prized sincerity and authentic personal expression above all else. This song feels different: The lyrics flatly complement the themes of the film, and the production is a kind of straightforward synth-pop you’d never get from Nine Inch Nails. For this lifelong NIN fan, to learn the lyrics weren’t all Reznor’s was clarifying and, somehow, relieving; to see him doing another artist’s bidding is strangely humanizing. As a movie theme, it’s fine. As a Nine Inch Nails track, it would be a bit vanilla. Either way, at a screening this week in Berlin, it had a few audience members chair-dancing their way through the final credits.",0,"May 6, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trent-reznor-atticus-ross-challengers-original-score/
Porches,Shirt,7.2,Rock,"Aaron Maine has always had a complicated relationship with rock’n’roll. In the early 2010s, his band Porches crystallized around unsteady and unsettled guitar music fit for the scrappy DIY venues and dingy basements he often played across the Northeast. Since then, his songs of yearning have become more experimental and opaque, taking tangents through misty synth-pop (2016’s Pool), dreamy dance music (2018’s The House), and blunted ballads that recall Arthur Russell’s lonesome home recordings (2020’s Ricky Music). But recently, he’s been thinking about getting loud again. On tour in support of the exuberant pop songs from 2021’s All Day Gentle Hold !, Maine got a chance to indulge that urge. He turned up the distortion on his guitar, thrashed around the stage, and screamed—a way of exorcizing the anxiety and unhinged energy that lurks beneath his music, even at its softest. These shows provided the immediate spark for Shirt, Maine’s sixth studio album as Porches, a collection of the most crushing songs he’s recorded to date. The record’s heaviest moments document what he’s called the “precarious emotional state” that he put himself in while making the record. Working in a windowless basement rehearsal space and smoking “a lot of weed” for the first time in his life, he allowed himself to explore an emotional terrain he doesn’t often access. He wrote songs about existential anxiety and day-to-day distress, accompanying the abstract yet upsetting imagery of his lyrics with shredded production and raw arrangements. Single “Rag” is perhaps most indicative of the intensity that Maine reaches toward throughout Shirt. Wounded and paranoid, he braids together lyrics about libidinous desire and flickering violence over a blown-out instrumental that evokes Deerhunter’s in-the-red adventures on Monomania. The coiled intensity of “Sally” recalls the gnarled miniatures that Maine’s former tourmate Alex G nestled between love songs on his own early records. On “Itch,” Maine further explores this distorted desperation, offering words of piety and pain while slamming away on menacing guitar chords that clang and clatter like an oil drum striking concrete. Shirt’s most striking moments twist these familiar rock tropes into something more uncanny. Auto-Tune, an occasional fixation of Maine’s, renders his voice gooey and gross, smearing it across the tracks like a bug caught under a windshield wiper. Even as guitars loom in the foreground, there are also moments like the narcotic ballad “Precious,” where every layer sounds unsteady and tense, as if a sinkhole might open up and swallow it. These are striking choices from an artist who’s spent nearly a decade making music that appeared conscious of its distance from his indie-rock roots. Now returning to those sounds, Maine uses them to create something more surreal and strange than he’s ever attempted. On the closing track, “Music,” he reflects, for a moment, on the merits of a life in rock. “I love to feel the highs,” he sings, “I love to feel the lows.” The mumbled couplet feels like an understatement. Knotty, distorted, and alien, Shirt operates only in intensity and extremes, an adrenaline shot for a songwriter liable to get lost in dreams.

Hovvdy,Hovvdy,8.3,Rock,"Countless playlists and anthologies have collected the greatest songs about a first kiss and a last goodbye; mourning a parent and becoming one yourself; best friends and mortal enemies. As for the cultivation of these relationships, there’s a 256-page book trying to reteach people how to hang out, but pop music isn’t going to be much help. Hovvdy isn’t going to tell you how to navigate these things either. On one song, they’re letting loved ones know that their time together mattered, and on the next they’re setting boundaries. They might reach out to a friend in quiet agony or chastise themselves for not doing so earlier. They’re figuring it all out as it comes, just like the rest of us, and the endlessly generous Hovvdy doesn’t attempt to be a manual for living, but a scrapbook of moments of love and loss from a life well-lived. A band’s self-titled fifth album can either announce a complete rebrand or a reassertion of identity. Hovvdy is something in between, the culmination of co-songwriter/vocalists Charlie Martin and Will Taylor's decade-long process of refining and broadening their sound. 2016’s Taster introduced the duo as “pillowcore,” which, like all genre coinage, was silly and also quite descriptive. Taster accurately predicted a future where slowcore, Buzz Bin blockbusters, rootsy bedroom-pop and station-wagon country became the primary colors of indie rock—they’ve since earned the respect of heavy-hitters like Zach Bryan and boygenius. Hovvdy’s music was charming, not crucial, nostalgic without evoking any specific era or age of their own, content to offer a shoulder if someone else wanted to spill their guts. Despite its relatively supersized specs—19 songs, nominally a double-album—Hovvdy doesn’t see itself as an epic. It doesn’t sprawl; it stretches its legs, kicks its feet up. The boldest experiments all ended up as singles; “Forever” is contented adult commitment in sentiment, MTV Spring Break in sound as Martin experiments with a half-rapped cadence over Dust Brothers record scratches. In a good pair of headphones, the riff of “Jean” imagines “Jessica” getting a microhouse cuts-and-clicks treatment. The giddy and gooey “Every Exchange” is part “Butterfly Kisses,” part “Fireflies” and all heart. “Til I Let You Know” is initially a spare sketch in the middle of Hovvdy until it gets reprised as the album’s climax on “Bad News,” recalling any number of bloghouse bangers that gave someone their third wind in the late aughts. Hovvdy has released albums called True Love and Billboard for My Feelings, but they never quite embodied those concepts as wholly as they do on “Meant,” which recasts their cover of Coldplay’s “Warning Sign” as proof of concept for their own Klieg-lit power ballad. A singles-only version of Hovvdy would still be seven tracks and a sci-fi lark where the band time travels across the last 25 years of recombinant alt-rock. Within the greater fabric of Hovvdy, they are joyous peaks, proof of how songs mocked in a more self-conscious time can be rehabbed and heard anew through a cunning needle drop, a class reunion, or just through the ears of a kid. After 17 tracks, Hovvdy is ready to reveal its thesis statement: “We’ll do a whole lot of talking/Don’t a lot have to happen,” Martin sings on the aching “Angel.” In moments like these, Hovvdy’s primary artistic analog might not be other musicians so much as Richard Linklater—another Lone Star sentimentalist who lets his work unfold at life’s pace, cobbling together a series of scenes and characters that vaguely resemble a plot. Linklater’s films are often considered comedies, though from an older, more cynical perspective, they might actually be psychological horror films with the prospect of adulthood looming offscreen like an invisible, airborne monster. The video for Hovvdy’s finest song, 2019’s “Ruin (my ride),” was their “party at the moon tower” minus the buzzkill brawl, with Martin, Taylor, and their friends doing an increasingly drunken Texas two-step late into the summer night, living out the happy future that no one in Dazed and Confused or Everybody Wants Some!! got to see for themselves. Yet the five years since has rendered “Ruin (my ride)” a bittersweet memory as well. Hovvdy are no longer the inseparable buds implied by the album cover—Martin lives in St. Louis, and Taylor in Nashville. Though Hovvdy toggles back and forth between lead vocals, the perspective is fairly consistent, earnest optimism spiked with just enough conflict to make it all feel earned. Taylor and Martin’s vocals top out at a frustrated exhale, yet they know how to bite down on expressions of absence—“I swore you left town, maaan” or “My bad I ghosted again.” Martin rues the limitations of his brotherly love on “Bubba,” and when he repeats “God I hate it,” it has the jarring impact of a black metal howl. In talking about Hovvdy to another longtime fan, I speculated that you could make a drinking game out of every time they say “love” or “light,” or the name of a family member, or a local landmark, or a Southern interstate. It was meant as a joke, but that’s kind of the point of Hovvdy; taking the time to truly savor the warm glow of a friendship maintained over time and space, service to the suffering rendered gladly, or just a day where you took the long way home just because that’s what your teenage self might’ve admired. It’s almost too easy to quote the climactic line from Linklater’s coming-of-age opus Boyhood: “The moment is constant, the moment seizes us.” But Martin and Taylor don’t think in opuses, in grand gestures and proclamations, in magic or illusion. Hovvdy simply slows down time just long enough to capture the beauty in the moments that always threaten to float away if they’re not captured immediately and cherished.

The Belair Lip Bombs,Lush Life,7.8,Rock,"Should I stay or should I go? The Belair Lip Bombs seize the baton and run with one of punk’s animating dichotomies on their debut album, a classic power-pop rager about the early stage of adult life when shades of gray start to overwhelm your rosy picture of how you thought things might turn out. “Should I stay here?/Should I say no?/Should I say yes?/Or should I go?” frontwoman Maisie Everett sings on “Stay or Go,” searching for a sign to make the decision for her and worrying that harboring big dreams—the album’s titular “lush life”—is just asking for disappointment. As the Melbourne four-piece grapple with the frustration of indecision, of non-committal lovers, of wanting to quit the rat race you’ve barely begun, their greyhound-lithe sound resists getting bogged down. Whatever fuels the great antipodean guitar pop bands—the Beths, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever, the Flying Nun greats—they’ve got it (as recognized by Third Man, who are reissuing the album after its 2023 Australian release). This is indie rock made to hit right in the pleasure center, built from a sturdy record collection (Television tessellations, Breeders cool, Strokes clean, casual virtuosity à la Pavement) but also possessed of a breeziness that belies any clenched study. “Gimme Gimme” starts in sneering, chin-out “Marquee Moon” lockstep, but loosens as Everett implores, “Don’t leave me high/Don’t leave me dry-y-y,” making a giddy waterslide of her helixing vocals. If her lyrics dwell on how draining it is to have to try at everything all the fucking time, the band never breaks a sweat. The Belair Lip Bombs primarily vault between two modes: a borderline standoffish strut so cool it makes you desperate to impress them, and rushing, headlong euphoria. Among the former, “Walking Away” holds a self-pitying friend at arm’s length, its bristling verses giving way to a slumping, defeated chorus; “Look the Part” builds tension through purposefully ugly guitar stabs and the rising feeling in Everett’s voice as she tries to make sense of an inscrutable situationship. These moments where they hold back give the exhilarating and unbridled songs a dam-breaking power. Opener “Say My Name” careens along a downhill rail, the rhythm section jangling like a loose chain, the middle eight bobbing and wheeling as if spoiling for a fight. “Things That You Did” is an appealingly raucous combination of Beach Boys-style harmonies and atonal incantations straight out of the Raincoats’ playbook. It’s jarring to listen closely and realize this sweet-sounding song is calling out a guy for sexual assault: Either it undersells the severity of the matter, or it’s a slightly unsuccessful attempt at highlighting just how banal these experiences are. For all Everett’s lyrics about feeling stuck, there’s also an abiding belief in something better, and the band’s dogged quest for it is infectious. Everett is capable of tenderness and rage, self-protective toughness and unvarnished soul, like Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein of Sleater-Kinney jostling for space in a single mouth. “World Is the One” toggles between sing-songy dispatches from a workaday life and a blown-out, raging swamp of sound that blows it all to smithereens; still, the song ends with Everett and her bandmates yelling, “This world is the one/This world is the one,” convinced it might yet live up to its potential. On “Easy on the Heart,” she even takes herself to task, apologizing that the songs she wrote as a younger woman were full of confected emotions and scenarios—another attempt to play the part. But her admission of superficiality is anything but: The arrangement—jabbing keys, a swaying ship-shape chorus—is fresh and freewheeling, and the lyrics are a tender and honest reflection of a more innocent time. Wherever the Belair Lip Bombs may be headed, Lush Life demonstrates they’re well on their way. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Moses Sumney,,8.0,Rock,"When Moses Sumney sings, “I am not a woman, I am not a man” in something close to his speaking voice on “Hey Girl,” I thought, Right on. He is himself and his artistic forebears too—namely, the Prince who offered a similar affirmation in “I Would Die 4 U” Then the kicker: “I am an amoeba.” The San Bernardino native of Ghanaian parents sings over squishy, squirrelly tracks whose post-Maxwell R&B foundations accommodate damaged rock rifflets and modest gospel overtones; you might imagine him practicing vocal runs in the bedroom before church. The six-song EP Sophcore—a curriculum vitae outlining his robust laryngeal resources—recaps Sumney’s achievements and sets up what audiences might expect from a new full-length statement. It’s a tease in the best sense. Four years ago, on his breakthrough album, grae, Sumney expressed the yearnings of a soul sonic force who loved being, as he sang on one of its most powerful tracks, “neither/nor.” That album’s “Virile,” a collaboration with industrial rock act Yvette, regarded masculinity as a land worth invading with a conquering army. To master such whisper-to-a-scream dynamics requires a sense of self that eschews bluster but is plenty assured. A collaboration with Portland producer Graham Jonson, who goes by quickly, quickly, yields Sophcore’s prettiest and liveliest moments. “Gold Coast” begins as a sensual, puttering thing indebted to Bjork’s Vespertine. Sumney’s chalky falsetto complements and works against the plucked guitars, distorted multi-tracked vocals, and synths; his impressionistic lyrics (“Talk in tongues, testify/Sunrise skin, color of clay”) say no thanks to coherence, bless them. A symphony of gurgles and music-box melodies cushions “I’m Better (I’m Bad),” in which Sumney recreates with louche delight a dialogue between himself and a feminized object of desire. Over Sophcore’s recombinant grooves, Sumney radiates a sense of fun. Confidence in his vocal talents doesn’t congeal into self-regard. Turns out he’s right: Trills and melisma suit arrangements that swell and contract like protoplasmic organisms. The finger-snapping rhythm track on the closing “Love’s Refrain” is almost an afterthought, a metronome to remind Sumney that his fascinations remain earthbound despite the stratospheric vantage point of his vowel experiments. “I was in my world, you were in yours too,” he coos, “so let’s refrain.” From what—independence or romance? Duetting with himself into infinity, he deepens the enigmas.",0,"August 6, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moses-sumney-sophcore-ep/
The Hard Quartet,The Hard Quartet,7.6,Rock,"The Hard Quartet is not, as pop stars say, a “project.” In the words of one of its members, Pavement and Jicks frontman Stephen Malkmus, “It’s a band,” man. It’s a band where every member—save for drummer Jim White—volunteered to play bass, and all contribute vocals. It’s a band that could have been named “Iron Chad” (or its inverse, “Silk Becky”), a band that waxes poetic about mortality on one song and sings about paddling frat frosh on the next. It’s a band of really funny people who are equally talented musicians, who spin up words like “lustify” as proficiently as they tear into a guitar solo. As the punny name suggests, the Hard Quartet is a group of four players—Malkmus, White, Matt Sweeney, and Emmett Kelly—who, combined, have known and performed with each other in various iterations for nearly a century. On its self-titled debut, the quartet cracks open the rock’n’roll canon to rebuild it in its communal, irreverent image. The idea for the band germinated when Sweeney, frontman of math-rockers Chavez, suggested it to Malkmus while working together on 2020’s Traditional Techniques. With a few texts to the other members, the Hard Quartet was born. On paper, their collaboration seems almost predestined: Sweeney and Kelly both frequently perform with folk revivalist Will Oldham, touring together for 2021’s Superwolves. White, another Oldham collaborator, performs with Kelly in a duo called the Double; back in 1994, his band the Dirty Three opened for Pavement. The only two without direct previous ties, Malkmus and Kelly, bonded over the latter’s Magma belt buckle. It’s easy to imagine a collective with this much shared history battling for the last riff or the final word. But the Hard Quartet instead overflows with a bounty of new ideas born from the synthesis of their sounds. No one is quite the lead, unlike in Pavement or Kelly’s band the Cairo Gang; nor is anyone relegated to session player, as on Oldham’s albums. The record traverses prog-rock epics, spit-shined power pop, gnarled punk, and baroque folk, flexing the vocal and instrumental personalities each member has developed over decades of road-tested rock. Not since Wowee Zowee has Malkmus sounded so delighted by his own vocal inflections (“Action for Military Boys”). Sweeney takes the intensity but not the anger from Chavez, effervescent and free. The Hard Quartet beats with an insatiable hunger to grow in new directions, rather than retread the past. At times, it’s clear which musician is leading the charge. The tilted melody of “Earth Hater” sounds like an extension of the Jicks’ 2018 record Sparkle Hard, and “Heel Highway” shares the ease and impish humor of Malkmus’s self-titled debut. The minor-key harmonies of “It Suits You” and fingerpicked guitar on “Jacked Existence” feel at home next to Sweeney’s 2005 Oldham collaboration Superwolf, and “Killed by Death” evokes Chavez’s wide-eyed sense of wonder. More often, it’s impossible to tell where one contributor’s ideas end and others take over. “North of the Border” opens with just Kelly’s unadorned vocals and guitar, but takes root when White’s drums crash in to give shape to his sunburnt riffs. “Our Hometown Boy” is a pure power-pop sugar rush—the chiming guitars of Big Star, the crystalline harmonies of Raspberries—but still makes time for lyrics about a “cloven-toed mistress” and Sweeney’s soaring guitar solo coda. “Rio’s Song” sparkles like a folk-rock gem polished by time, enacting the swaggering camaraderie suggested by its Rolling Stones-inspired video through White’s drum fills and Malkmus’s ricochetting fretwork. It’s classic rock comfort food that retains the willful eccentricity and goofball impulses of its creators. As expected from this band, the lyrics are at turns profound and wry. There’s “Sister Sludge” with “eyes of stoplight green” on “Chrome Mess,” and “no Debbie Downers allowed on the spaceship” on “Thug Dynasty” (another justly rejected band name). On “Six Deaf Rats,” the closest thing to a Pavement album cut, Malkmus asks, “Why are you sleeping in those high heels shoes? Where is the logic in that?” (Always sleep red-carpet-ready, Steve!) Others read like Pig Latin: in-jokes that work purely because of the conviction in their delivery. Try to parse the e.e. cummings puzzle logic of “Pie chart me kid/When I went big/Better be a sizable chunk,” the opening line on “Earth Hater,” and you’ll miss the swagger of Sweeney’s guitar and the buzz of Kelly’s synthesizer. The zanier moments are grounded by more philosophical musings: “All we gain isn’t there for us to keep,” Sweeney observes on “Rio’s Song.” On “Heel Highway,” Malkmus manages to sing, “Bring me peace on Earth” without sounding like a dirty hippie or a snarky cynic. Is the Hard Quartet a supergroup? Their deep mutual admiration is clear. Yet there’s none of the stiffness, artificiality, or inflated sense of purpose that can arise when such rich legacies combine. The Hard Quartet is confident, not cocky; they seem like they genuinely like to make each other laugh, and their gorgeous melodies feel like the natural output of four rock vets hanging out together in Malibu. Maybe, as Malkmus said, they really are just a band, man. The Hard Quartet lets us into their circle for just under an hour; it’s hard not to want to bask in its stoned brilliance even longer.

skaiwater,#gigi,7.4,Rap,"It’s the beginning of summer, skin is exposed, and the urge to get up and move is growing. Enter skaiwater: a Nottingham artist, currently stationed in L.A., who’s breaking out of the web underground with a kinetic blend of blown-out bedroom rap, futuristic R&B, and electronic experimentation. Initial iterations were moody, subdued sketches in a similar vein to Travis Scott. But when skaiwater took production into their own hands, they started multiplying the tracks in the DAW, adding layers of detail and pent-up drama. “#miles” and “eyes,” experiments indebted to Jersey club, kept the style’s pounding drums and danceable rhythms but substituted the usual raunchy lyrics for heartfelt pleas to a love interest. These singles couldn’t be as easily categorized, melding frenzied dancefloor energy with intimate thoughts typically reserved for private conversation. The imaginative tinkering culminates on skaiwater’s new album, #gigi. Primarily self-produced, it mashes together some of the decade’s most prevalent sounds into a crispy mix that plays like an amalgamation of SoundCloud likes. Beats venture all across the African diaspora; skaiwater makes excursions to chaotic Brazilian funk, Jamaican dancehall grooves, and the jittery litefeet that turns up NYC parks. Distorted bass and random EQ hijinks will terrorize your speaker. Vocal pitches fluctuate all over the place. Taking inspiration from this many places at once can mean spreading yourself thin or bloating the final product. skaiwater makes it all work by never directly emulating specific genres, instead using them as jumping-off points. Their adventurous splices generate brand-new compounds: “real feel” grabs the skittering hi-hats and shattering 808s that accompanies the off-the-wall maximalism of a natecxo beat and lays them over a ’70s soul sample. On “richest girl alive,” Auto-Tuned emo wails find pockets of melody between funk-infused drum patterns. The PARTYNEXTDOOR-core serenade “princess” builds up a pillow of delicate acoustics before climaxing into Young Thug-esque ad-libs. On “run,” Milwaukee low-end claps and New Orleans bounce rhythms poke through skaiwater’s dejected vocals. These engrossing sound beds shield a raw display of feelings. “wna torture me tn?”, a team-up with Atlanta rapper Karrahbooo, flirts with masochism: “Sacrifice me like a lamb,” skaiwater croons. “Box” sandwiches hints of obsession (“Prized possession, hang you up in my archive”) between Jersey-club bed squeaks. Confidence fuels the freeform Atlanta-sourced flows in “bleach” and “rain” as skaiwater cycles between admiration and disdain for a lover. Even Lil Nas X captures some of that suavity in his feature on “light!,” the album’s most radio-ready track and only song not produced by skaiwater: Producer 9lives’ glimmering synth piano leads the way for a streak of catchy, celebratory bars about an overdue breakup. Those sighs of relief rarely last long. skaiwater surfs between moods and soundscapes at a moment’s notice, omnivorous in a way that’s reminiscent of a young Kanye West. Perpetually restless, #gigi mines the full spectrum of musical ideas percolating through the internet, sourcing niche ingredients for a meal that offers something for every taste. Sometimes the broad scope and fast pace swallows up the endearing quirks that define specific scenes. But more often, it feels like firing up a freshly jailbroken phone: a ticket to endless possibilities concealed just out of sight.",0,"June 26, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/skaiwater-gigi/
2hollis,boy,7.2,Pop/R&B / Electronic,"2hollis is a beloved fixture in a music scene with no name. What do you call a mash of Bladee, Chief Keef, Max Martin, Skrillex, and the Geometry Dash computer game soundtrack, anyway? The 20-year-old, Los Angeles-based singer, rapper, and producer, whose real name is Hollis Frazier Herndon, makes wildly processed industrial dance pop and rap: His pyrotechnic production is the stuff of a cooped-up prodigy whose mind can’t help but move a million miles an hour. Early releases garnered a fervent internet following, his sub-Reddit and Discord channel filled with kids obsessing over his personal history, production techniques, and eerie aesthetic, which I can only describe as Roscoe Dash does medieval. His early content, though, has been scrubbed from the internet. Past projects and music videos now live via aliases and alt accounts; scrapped Instagram stories and deleted tweets are archived on fan forums. His official pages include only a sliver of his catalog, the few pictures he shares of himself a selection of highly filtered headshots. He’s hardly done any interviews, rarely posts on social media, and barely promotes his music. So why, on a niche corner of the internet, are kids calling him a messiah? Hollis didn’t come out of nowhere. His mom, Kathryn Frazier, is the founder of the PR firm Biz 3, whose roster includes the Weeknd, J. Cole, and Daft Punk. She also co-owns a record label with Skrillex, while his dad, John Herndon, was the drummer for Tortoise and releases solo music as A Grape Dope. While Hollis has likely benefited from a life spent around musicians, his work feels most influenced by internet addiction and multimedia fluency. It might be tempting to peg him as just another kid with bleach-blond hair uploading iterative computer music to SoundCloud—an offshoot of whatever it was we decided hyperpop meant. But Hollis’ latest full-length album, boy, establishes him as a remarkably distinctive, eagerly experimental savant whose sound never stalls or stagnates. Before his recent pivot to industrial dance and electropop, Hollis’ music mostly resembled that of Drain Gang stalwarts Yung Lean and Bladee, Swedish accent and all (although Hollis is from Chicago). Cloud rap suited him; his 2022 EP, As Within, So Without, made with producer kimj, features some of his best songs. Last year, when he dropped 2, an electroclash house record, the switch at first felt stark. The album is all shook-up soda and manic bravado: warp-speed synth leads and arpeggios, wet columns of bass and angsty singing, skittery four-on-the-floor drums and explosive FX. On closer inspection, Hollis’ idiosyncratic take on dance music isn’t all that different from his quirky interpolations of trap and drill. At a time when dance music is pop and pop is rap and rap is emo and everything is electronic, Hollis’ ability to swerve and synthesize his scatter-brained source material into a unique amalgam of genre-blurring music stands out. It’s an exciting development for an artist who may just be scratching the surface of his best work. boy surpasses 2 as an even clubbier, gummier electropop record. “two bad” is brighter and more radio-ready than anything in Hollis’ discography—a huge gated synth lead supports his urgent, insistent singing, which sounds like Justin Bieber after seven cigarettes. And while the track could certainly be played at big-tent EDM festivals, what differentiates “two bad” from your standard glowstick banger is how relentlessly it reinvents itself. Drums shift tempos and textures mid-song, an endless supply of synth patches roving madly around the mix. On “say it again,” another rave-destined track, Hollis resists simple patterns and structures—a lo-fi piano breakdown interrupts the song’s midpoint; a whole verse is dedicated to Hollis muttering “I want you to say it again” above a pulsing bass and stuttering synth pluck. The mutating compositions make for an exhilarating listen, whether you tune in on headphones, while driving, or as you thrash around a neon-streaked club. One of Hollis’ more obvious strengths as a vocalist is how powerfully he can distill visceral emotions through seemingly simple means. Opener “you once said my name for the first time” may be the most elegantly constructed song in his catalog, a whiny digital organ giving way to soaring choral harmonies before the song bursts into a droning, deranged drop that lasts nearly two minutes. “One day I’ll say your name for the last time,” he sings with conviction, extending the final note until his voice falters. Even when he returns to his trusted bag of blustery, bit-crushed rap, like on late album highlight “lie,” he communicates anguish and longing despite cycling through clichés (“cross my eyes, I hope to die/I’ll never lie”). Hollis can communicate lust, regret, rage, or despair with a snicker or sigh, a screech or vocal chop, a melody so disorientingly strange it elicits an emotional reaction, even if the writing’s puerile and unspecific. This transference isn’t always rendered so smoothly. “promise” is a forgettable attempt at a bombastic piano ballad, and “sister,” though one of boy’s finer beats, is fraught with a peculiar analogy about loving your girlfriend like a sibling. Languishing too long in Hollis’ world can drain as much as it enlivens, simulating the sensation of replenishing your serotonin stores after doing too much molly. But Hollis isn’t in the business of pacing himself. He’s racing full speed ahead, threatening to blast open any preconceptions you may have had about what a kid making music on a laptop can accomplish.",0,"June 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2hollis-boy/
Yasmin Williams,Acadia,7.9,Folk/Country,"Yasmin Williams is one of the most inventive guitar players of the last decade, an artist devoted to deploying seemingly every technique imaginable to coax new sounds and ideas out of her instrument. She hammers the strings and wallops the body and taps the frets; she strums and drums and plucks with such speed and agility that her performances feel like sleights of hands, as though she owes as much to Ricky Jay as she does to Leo Kottke. But it’s all in service of her tautly, gracefully composed songs, which she approaches with a storyteller’s eye for setting and specificity, just as a lyricist might. Williams didn’t merely write her 2021 album Urban Driftwood during the tumultuous year of 2020, but wrote it about those hard times. “I Wonder (Song for Michael)” was one of several inspired by the demonstrations she attended in Washington, DC. But instead of evoking the commotion and peril of facing off against the police, Williams was much more interested in the warm camaraderie she felt for her fellow demonstrators, all of whom were taking similar risks toward a common goal. Warm camaraderie of a different sort defines her follow-up, Acadia. It’s a bright, imaginative expansion of Williams’ sound, gregarious where Urban Driftwood sounded ruminative and solitary. Almost all of these songs feature a different set of players: The folk duo of Allison de Groot and Tatiana Hargreaves color in “Hummingbird” with banjo runs and fiddle reels, respectively; the Nashville cosmic-jazz musician Rich Ruth adds soft synths to “Virga.” Dom Flemons plays the rhythm bones on “Cliffwalk” as Williams’ riffs subdivide like fractals, adding impossible grace notes, and Immanuel Wilkins concludes the album with an ecstatic alto saxophone solo. That motley assortment of musicians reflects the variety of Williams’ interests, which range from folk and old-time to jazz and classical composition. Acadia takes her far from the streets of DC and deep into the woods and mountains. She signals as much with the song titles, but also with the music itself. “Hummingbird” flutters through a garden, the busy guitar and banjo buzzing around a central theme and settling into a familiar old-time jig. This song and several others settle into what sounds like an early ending, only to take flight again, as though Williams’ mind, like a hummingbird’s wings, is always in motion. On “Harvest,” she picks long melodic lines on her guitar, which sound like they have less to do with the physical labor of bringing in crops and more to do with the pleasure of exhaustion. You can almost see the sun setting over empty fields. Her songs remain as focused as ever, and she uses these other musicians with the same consideration with which she uses various techniques; nothing is simply spectacle. More than anything else in Williams’ catalog, Acadia is open to tangents, wild ideas, sudden realizations, and sustained moods. Listening to “Virga” and “Sisters” is like finding shapes in clouds: The music is daydreamy, each sound blurred around the edges, changing so gradually you may not notice until it’s something entirely different. Some of the album’s finest moments deploy the human voice like another instrument. The pillowy, almost New Age vocals on “Virga” sound like they’re suspended in the air, blown by a gentle breeze, and when this choir sings actual words, it’s nearly impossible to make them out. It’s fitting for a song named after the meteorological phenomenon of rain evaporating before it hits the ground. Williams appreciates the friction of sounds and ideas, so her songs rise and fall, build and crest, shout and whisper. They’re alive to both the orderliness of a carefully constructed melody and the chaos of being in the moment. As Acadia progresses, it blossoms and expands, adding new instruments. She picks up an electric guitar on “Dream Lake” and shreds bucolically. She trades licks with Wilkins’ saxophone on “Malamu,” and the song rocks unselfconsciously. It’s the biggest and riskiest moment on the album, a finale whose fusion of jazz and folk and rock frees her up to go in any direction on her next album. Unexpected yet exuberant, it sounds like the work of the harvest giving way to the celebration of the feast. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Clairo,Charm,7.5,Pop/R&B,"On the final track of her third album, Clairo finds herself at the pier, “playing out moments when there was a touch.” Just a touch: more intimate than pining from afar, sure, but not a kiss or even so much as an embrace. These kinds of experiences—when the memory of a tiny gesture captures the entirety of your attention—are hallmarks of Claire Cottrill’s best songwriting, like the flushed cheeks of “Bags” or the objectifying glances of “Blouse.” On Charm, she retains her attention to these fleeting touches, but pairs them with a lush, rich production, sinking deeper into a soft rock sound that is at once smoldering and whimsical. Charm is not a dramatic shift in the manner of Clairo’s second album, 2021’s Sling. After she achieved viral fame as a teen on the strength of her sweetly lo-fi YouTube uploads, Clairo released Immunity, her impressive Rostam Batmanglij-produced debut. Then she took a left turn. She moved to upstate New York, teamed with producer Jack Antonoff, and holed up in the woods to make Sling. Where Immunity showed off Clairo’s kinship with bedroom pop darlings like Frankie Cosmos, Sling worshiped at the altar of Carole King—a pastoral, folky album that seemed entirely uninterested in chasing her past or reaching for new pop hits. To make Charm, Clairo worked with another new producer, Leon Michels, known for his work in the El Michels Affair and as a member of the Dap-Kings. Together, they dug deeper into the ’70s palette Clairo developed on Sling and crafted arrangements dense with Wurlitzer, mellotron, piano, and organ. “Slow Dance” ends with fluttering flute and clarinet; “Terrapin” is filled with piano flourishes. If Antonoff’s production on Sling sometimes felt cool or atmospheric, Charm emits a palpable warmth. Plus, most of these songs groove. Clairo’s vocals remain, by and large, hushed, but thanks to the golden-hued production, her voice comes across more like a murmur in a crush’s ear than a sheepish mumble on a first date. The intimate experiences that Clairo examines on Charm have to do, she’s said, with “fleeting moments … where I’ve been charming or have been charmed” and the fantasies such moments can produce. It’s a mood Charm’s sensual confidence and retro propulsion readily conjures: “You make me wanna/Go buy a new dress,” she sings on “Juna,” “You make me wanna/Slip off a new dress.” On “Sexy to Someone,” a cozy song about wanting to be wanted, Clairo’s feather-light voice sways atop playful production you could almost call funky. Even in more downcast moments—when Clairo sings of mourning a love while “all alone upstate,” or describes how she’ll “pull on the string/That binds me to memories of/The way I loved you”—the music never wallows. Rarely do these songs stray from this sophisticated palette. It suits her well, but it marks Charm as yet another successful but polite soft-rock outing, a format with somewhat diminishing returns. One song towards the album’s end breaks away gently from the rest: “Echo,” a spacey highlight where psychedelic synths and Clairo’s droning delivery bring it closer to Broadcast than Carly Simon. It’s a strange tune about a love that “goes nowhere,” whose musical gestures enhance its lyrical ones. These are the quotidian details and the tiny imperfections that make Clairo’s music uniquely alluring. It’s a new kind of Clairo song, but it has what makes the best Clairo songs so unforgettable.

Peggy Gou,I Hear You,6.2,Electronic,"Has any DJ played the game quite like Peggy Gou? Plenty of DJs are influencers, but it’s rare they have a catalog of stylish deep house 12""s to their name. Some are fashion models, but have they been on multiple covers of Vogue, Dazed, Elle, and Harper’s Bazaar? There’s always that one percent of superstar DJs bopping between Vegas, Ibiza, and Dubai on their private jets—but only one of them is a 32-year-old Korean woman who insists on managing herself. Gou has gone from zero to 500 mph in the years since she swapped a fashion career for dance music, ticking off every conceivable goal for a rising celebrity DJ: the first Korean woman to play Berghain, headline sets at Ibiza’s superclubs, a crossover hit on a cool indie, a clothing line backed by Virgil Abloh, a Kylie Minogue remix to promote three new flavors of Magnum ice cream. Most impressively, last year she released “(It Goes Like) Nanana,” a frothy ’90s house bagatelle that went to No. 1 in five countries and has been streamed nearly 500 million times. This is not the sort of thing that happens to DJs, unless their name is Diplo, David Guetta, or Calvin Harris. Now, eight years after her first single, she releases her debut album on XL Recordings, home to big-league dance acts from the Prodigy to Overmono. Drawing heavily on the ’90s club music that Gou says “changed her taste” during lockdown, I Hear You operates in the same mode of retro fantasia that generated “Nanana,” cherry-picking iconic sounds from house music’s ’80s and ’90s heyday. In rough historical order, we’ve got glassy Italo synths, super-sized syndrums, pumping organs, plasticky MIDI horns, the fierce thwack of the TR-909, several saggy breakbeats, and one tasty jungle loop. Gou is good at stirring up rosy nostalgia for some long-lost Disco Europa, a mood that strikes a chord with a generation longing for the imagined freedom and optimism of dance music’s golden era. Her breakout tracks—2018’s “It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)” and “Han Jan”—were defined by their space, restraint, and melody. What they lacked in over-ratcheted builds and drops they made up for in cosmic detailing: bongos, twinkling bells, aquatic basslines, and a uniquely dreamy femininity imparted by Gou’s faux-naive speak-singing in a mixture of Korean and English. I Hear You strikes a frustrating standoff between these two versions of Gou: It lacks the authentic quirkiness of those earlier hits, yet never lets loose the confetti cannons and fishbowl cocktails promised by “Nanana.” That song is a perfect Frankenstein of familiar club moments: Korg M1 organs, the pitch-bent lick from ATB’s “9 PM (Till I Come),” a polyglottal chorus a lot like A Touch of Class’ Eurohouse hit “Around the World.” What else to say about this neatly welded banger? It’s simply too effective to care what you think of it. It would also be remarkable for Gou to pull off the trick a second time on the same album. “Back to One” is a fun attempt, packed with pumping organs and tacky brass, but the vocals don’t take off and her fake laughter suggests the opposite of carefree euphoria. “1+1=11” is plastic Balearica, mixing a sparkly synth-guitar line with a breakbeat here, an acid wiggle there. “Lobster Telephone” plays to Gou’s strengths with its flamboyant ’80s touches, and might even be a sly dig at Western fans’ noncomprehension of her Korean-language vocals: The lyrics are apparently surreal nonsense (hence the Dalí-referencing title), which makes the meaning equally foreign to everyone. The rest, to borrow an idea from a house classic, is a land of confusion. There are two collaborations (duets, in fact): one with an internationally recognized pastiche-rock god who just turned 60, the other with a trans rapper from Puerto Rico known for a 2023 collaboration with Latin Grammy-winning producer Bizarrap. What connects Lenny Kravitz and Villano Antillano? Well, they’re both on this album. “I Believe in Love Again” is as syrupy and sincere as its title suggests, grooving along at a radio-friendly tempo. The chorus has a vacant, Random Access Memories disco slinkiness, but Kravitz’s smug squeal is such a powerful turnoff I’ve since been using it as a contraceptive—and I actually like the guy. Meanwhile “All That,” showcasing Antillano’s Spanish-language raps over a slowed-down “Think” break, could have been a spritz of campy mystery and romance, but instead feels like an earnest slog. In the filler zone of tracks seven to nine, Gou doubles down on her signature moves, adding bigger builds and acid-burst drops (“I Go”) and following Moby’s formula for melancholy exotica (“Purple Horizon”). “Seoulsi Peggygou (서울시페기구)” is much more likable, juxtaposing a folkish melody on Korean gayageum (probably played by Gou herself) with salsa horns and a jungle loop intelligent enough for LTJ Bukem. But the East-West fusion doesn’t go further than that—it’s no “Sumo Jungle Grandeur,” for example—and the experiment is dropped after two and a half minutes. But whatever! It’s a ’90s-inspired dance album, we’re here to have fun and down a few piña coladas, are we not? If only Gou had the same idea. The problem really starts with the opening track. “Your Art” is a portentous introduction, with Italo storm clouds gathering under a spoken-word salad of Instagram affirmations and vague political soundbites. “Create your universe anew… be present,” she says hypnotically. “Look up, look down… what do you see?” These words are adapted from a poem by Olafur Eliasson, an artist and eco-activist once known for installing an artificial sun in London’s Tate Modern; he also designed the strange mirrored headpiece Gou wears on the album cover. “We have colonized, industrialized, modernized,” she continues, improbably. “We have forgotten self-respect, and to listen to ourselves.” This is a planetary-scale reach for an artist who, for one thing, must be among the music industry’s biggest carbon emitters (did nobody inform Eliasson?). And unless there are some revolutionary slogans hidden in the mix, nothing on I Hear You engages with art or politics or nature in any graspable way. By prefacing her debut with this meaningless own goal, Gou undermines her brand as global party girl in chief and reminds us of everything we’d rather forget while we’re on our fizzy beach holiday: the poisonous waste produced by the fashion industry, the lethal emissions generated by the private jets and luxury cars she likes, the murderous regimes that use electronic music festivals to culture-wash their reputations. The “leave politics out of music” brigade might be annoyed that any of this is even mentioned in conjunction with their fave, but look—she started it. Gou is blessed with talent; she writes, produces, mixes, plays her own instruments, is an exceptional DJ; she’s born to win. As her Billboard interviewer recently noted, she has “a business acumen that could be characterized as corporate hustle if it didn’t also happen inside dark techno clubs.” There’s no point in throwing around grand concepts like so much glitter in order to feel like a serious album artist—just turn up the “nananas” and keep the piña coladas coming.

ian,Valedictorian,4.1,Rap,"Yeah, there’s another viral rap sensation. I know, this happens basically every other week, but this is our reality. Some are cool as hell; some I hope to never hear again. There will be many, many more. This one is named ian. Yes, just ian. After a few years of uploading music to SoundCloud, he blew the fuck up in early 2024 through a combination of outrage clicks and undiscerning excitement. The reason was simple: He was a white guy dressed like a frat boy on his way to his 8 a.m. finance class who made technically OK music that sounded like he was in Slayworld, the internet-famous group that once included Summrs, Autumn!, Izaya Tiji, and Yeat. Yeat is white, too, but unlike Yeat, who tried to distract from his whiteness with the questionable use of turbans and alien-speak, ian leaned into his suburban white kid schtick: vanilla outfits (white tee, sweats, slides) and a From the Block video for his breakout song “Figure It Out” shot at an outdoor lunch with his sitcom-looking real-life family, where you can spot full wine glasses, a prep school hoodie, and an American flag swaying in the wind. “Figure It Out” is the lead single to ian’s first full mixtape, Valedictorian, which includes artwork that mimics the “You know I had to do it to ’em” meme and premiered at a packed listening party on the streets of New York, blasted out of the sunroof of a minivan. It’s probably his best song, though that isn’t saying much. Through his slurred, ATL-style melodies, he delivers a sprint of catchy flexes like, “Can’t choose what color I’m feelin’ today, thank God it’s a two-toned watch” and “My big brother like Marshawn Lynch, he’ll run through somebody.” The official Lyrical Lemonade video (anywhere there’s a popular rapping white boy, you’ll find Cole Bennett) even includes a cameo from Marshawn Lynch, which is pretty cringe because you just know the joke is supposed to be Tough, Black ex-NFL star hangs out with suburban white rapper. That right there explains the problem with Valedictorian: It’s making a joke out of the music and culture it’s trying to swagger-jack. Everything is so tongue in cheek: Look, isn’t it so funny that a college-age white kid who you could imagine playing lacrosse at a New England private school has a mixtape hosted by DJ Holiday, famous for talking his shit on some of the greatest Gucci Mane and Chief Keef projects? “This the coldest motherfucker I seen in a long ass time, dressed white as hell though,” says Holiday, laughing (probably in disbelief about how much he’s being paid). “Fuckin’ rich ass prick.” Look, isn’t it so funny that he’s got beats that sound like old Zaytoven (all except one by producer Sxprano)? “Judgment,” with its calming strings and crafty drums, sounds like a replica of something Zay would have given to Yung L.A. Look, isn’t it so funny when he raps a bunch of car puns like Young Dro (“They go both ways in the Cullinan truck, the doors must hate each other,” from “Grand Slam”), or imitates the Auto-Tune melodies of Dirty Sprite-era Future (“Bentayga”), or wants so badly to be Chief Keef (“AirBnb”)? The irony is there to distract you from the fact that this is empty music. If you heard it without a face attached, you would click on it, observe that it’s a sauceless copy of its influences, and keep scrolling. That said, none of Valedictorian is unlistenable—just devoid of any personality or imagination. Performing an amalgamation of melodic regional rap of the last decade or so, ian lacks the ability or intention to do anything other than replicate music that already exists. He’s not rewiring ATL swag of the past like Bear1boss or dissecting nostalgic dance rap like Xaviersobased. He’s just a white kid that has heard a lot of rap, and there are lots of them. After years spent falling down SoundCloud wormholes, I’m almost numb to white rappers that would probably do the surgery from Face/Off with Chief Keef or Young Thug if it were possible. So my initial instinct with the ian phenomenon was to shrug and say it’s not that deep—at least he isn’t Lil Mabu or Brennan Jones, rappers so clearly making a mockery of the genre to feed their thirst for fame. At least there aren’t any nascent signs of a pop-country or indie rock pivot, not yet. But the more I think about it, there is something unsettling about ian’s fast rise. He’s stumbled onto a simple, repeatable blueprint that absorbs Black influences while presenting and marketing himself as if he isn’t. That might be scarier than all of the obvious rip-offs of the past, because suddenly you can imagine opening your eyes to see a mainstream rap landscape overrun with ians. (Introducing your Rolling Loud headliners owen, hunter, and dust1n, brought to you by Backwoods and Meta!) Another step toward the far-away, or not so far-away, day when we will have to remind the people around us about the Black roots of rap, because Spotify playlists sure won’t. Well, until then, see you next week when another rapper falls from the cloud.",0,"May 23, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ian-valedictorian/
Boldy James,Across the Tracks,7.8,Rap,"A few years ago, superproducer and frequent Boldy James collaborator the Alchemist discovered that the rapper likes to write in cars. “Not even a moving vehicle,” Alchemist told Complex; “he’s just parked up with the lights on, and he gets his mind right.” That habit fits with the alert repose of the Detroiter’s ruminative drug rap. James’ music is still and relaxed, yet taut as a wound spring. At any moment, violence or emotion might erupt from the calm, like a parked vehicle charging into traffic. Boldy’s meditations have become a cottage industry since 2020. Every few months, he’ll huddle up with a single producer—like Alchemist, Jay Versace, or Nicholas Craven—and emerge with another casually prismatic street chronicle. It’s shocking how seldom he repeats himself, even as his collaborators tap similar loop-based beats. Working with one producer seems to allow Boldy to zoom in on a particular moment in time—be it the aftermath of a devastating car crash or the stressful prologue to his rap career—and capture every racing thought. On Across the Tracks, a team-up with Missouri producer Conductor Williams, Boldy sifts through recollections of life on the road and on the grind. The album is a travelogue of memories, each song grasping at some distant locale or experience. The title, which plays on producer Conductor Williams’ name, suits the music’s pensive and peripatetic mood. Conductor, one of the pillars of Griselda Records’ luxe and wavy sound, specializes in dreamy beats built around yawning samples, and this collection is his strongest. He seems to loll his samples rather than chop them, stretching sounds like taffy and then arranging drums and melodies around their elongated shapes. “Flying Trapeze Act” starts with a gorgeous vocal loop and bleeds into a star stream of percussion and chords that flicker in and out of focus as Boldy waxes about close calls. “Used to feel trapped in the ghetto, tryna to break free/On a 30-year run, I feel like an escapee,” he says with relief. Rappers often turn reflective and defiant on Conductor beats; his arrangements have the transportive sparkle of reveries. As if daydreaming, Boldy spends Across the Tracks teetering between the past and the present. He is dazzlingly limber on standout “The Ol Switcharoo,” bouncing off the clomping downbeat as he recalls life on the go. “East, west, running back and forth tryna run his money up the long way/Stepped on it like a bunion, had a run-yun for the mun-yun/Sold more circles than some Funyuns, all eyes on me through the tollways,” he raps, stretching his words to fit the soothing beat’s languid cadence. His use of directions rather than specific places reinforces the feeling that he is never at rest. Even when James does use proper nouns, his narratives are generally scrambled. Key motifs and throughlines become legible only through the subtle accretion of tiny details and tensions amid the slick flexes. Driving makes him antsy (“Touchin' down was a cakewalk, I was more nervous on the drive back”) and puts him at ease (“Backin’ Wraith out the garage, I'm through the stratosphere”). His first brick of cocaine, the “worst” one, marks him like a curse, but he boasts, “I just took that bitch to pound town” of a bundle he deems “Sexxy Red.” The FBI, which gets multiple mentions, makes him wary of unfamiliar cars. But also, the feds are just haters: “Whole Bureau know that a nigga high-profile.” There is no explicit payoff to these threads, but they add ballast to Boldy’s twisty verses, which can seem leisurely because of his laidback delivery but often burble with conflict and regret. Conductor’s use of wailing voices and snatches of dialogue accents the rapper’s frequent mentions of dead friends and old memories. James’ Detroit, like Vince Staples’ Long Beach and Ka’s Brownsville, is both a physical place and a spectral presence. Despite this haunted dynamic, the album ends with an embrace of home. Closer “Stamps in the Middle,” set to fuzzy horn blasts and hazy drums that echo opener “Terms and Conditions,” casts Boldy’s arcing journey as prodigal. “Yeah, I sold drugs, but that ain't shit to be ashamеd about/I made it out unscathed, blocks so hot that you could sunbathe/Nеighborhood full of dead ends and one-ways,” he raps with pride. This bleak, claustrophobic image shouldn’t be charming, but his conviction, and Conductor’s sanguine beat, coat it in warmth.",0,"July 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/boldy-james-conductor-williams-across-the-tracks/
Neil Young & Crazy Horse,Fu##in’ Up,7.6,Rock,"The significance of the Rivoli to Toronto music lore cannot be overstated. Upon opening in 1982, the Queen Street West venue became an epicenter of local bohemia, with a streetfront restaurant serving up pad thai to art students on first dates, a second-floor pool hall where you could wager away the last of your beer money, and most crucially, an intimate, 200-capacity brick-walled performance room where the city’s freaks had free rein. Through the ’80s, it was the space where queercore pioneers Fifth Column turned their gigs into Super 8 film happenings, the Cowboy Junkies perfected their brand of codeined country, and a pre-TV Kids in the Hall pushed sketch comedy to anarchic extremes. In the late ’90s, it was the place where a young Leslie Feist workshopped songs and tended bar. And a decade after that, you might’ve caught a teenage Aubrey Graham trying his hand at improv. Even now, long after the Queen West neighborhood’s cachet has diminished, the Rivoli is still a place where music history is made: Last November, it hosted arguably the strangest Neil Young and Crazy Horse gig ever. There’s nothing that shocking about an artist of Neil Young’s stature playing a room as tiny as the Riv—the surprise small-venue underplay is a fairly common move for arena-level acts promoting a new album or warming up for a big tour. But the circumstances surrounding the Rivoli show—a private 50th-birthday party for billionaire Canada Goose parka poobah Dani Reiss—raised a few eyebrows, given that Neil’s spent a good chunk of his career putting corporations in his crosshairs. (Maybe, after spending his formative years in Winnipeg, Neil just really appreciates a warm winter coat.) What’s even more unfathomable is that Neil Young and Crazy Horse were actually the opening act—in keeping with the party’s theme of “age before beauty,” their set was followed by an appearance from Canadian rock-radio mainstays the Arkells. But the live-album document of the gig, titled Fu##in’ Up, is more than just a glorified souvenir from the sort of birthday party that presumably required its guests to sign NDAs. At the Rivoli, Neil and the Horse performed a track-by-track (minus one) run-through of 1990’s Ragged Glory, and in a nod to the gig’s secretive logistics, all of the songs—save for the cover of the ’60s garage-band standard “Farmer John”—have been rebranded for Fu##in’ Up with new titles pulled from their respective lyrics. If 1989’s course-correcting Freedom offered an encouraging sign that Neil hadn’t completely lost the plot during his infamous ’80s wilderness years, Ragged Glory affirmed his elder-statesman status for a new generation of flannel-clad feedback addicts, prompting tours with Sonic Youth and a million “godfather of grunge” plaudits. The album topped the Village Voice’s Pazz & Jop critics’ poll and was widely hailed as an electrifying display of vitality from a veteran band entering their third decade together—and that was 34 years ago. Now that Neil and his bandmates are pushing 80 (if not already there) Ragged Glory’s spirit of camaraderie, perseverance, and bittersweet nostalgia feels all the more trenchant. If a line like “There’s very few of us left, my friend, from the days that used to be” carried a whiff of melancholy in 1991, imagine what it feels like to sing it now. But where Ragged Glory captured Crazy Horse rocking out with the volume and vigor of a band half its age, Fu##in’ Up highlights both the corroding effects and uncanny advantages of aging. For decades now, we’ve watched our classic-rock heroes grapple with getting old: The Stones would have you believe they’re still horny 20-year-olds; the tinnitus-plagued surviving members of the Who traded smashed guitars for orchestral embellishment; Paul McCartney is the hip grandad. But on Fu##in’ Up, Neil Young and Crazy Horse embody what it really means to age. They move a bit slower but sound a lot crankier. They’re blithely unconcerned with formalities—like hitting the chorus of “City Life (Country Home)” at the right moment—because they don’t really give a shit about impressing anybody anymore. And they rumble into Fu##in’ Up’s agitated titled track (aka “Heart of Steel”) with all the subtlety of an uncontrolled bowel movement. The Crazy Horse heard here isn’t exactly the same one that cut the original Ragged Glory: Early ’70s-era member Nils Lofgren returns to the right-hand-man slot occupied by Frank Sampedro for several decades, while the perennial quartet appears as a quintet with the recruitment of Promise of the Real guitarist/pianist Micah Nelson (who’ll be taking over Lofgren’s position on the Horse’s 2024 dates). The piano actually adds some surprising grace notes to all the grimy guitarnage: “Feels Like a Railroad (River of Pride) [White Line]” acquires some saloon-door swing, while the ivory-boosted bounce of “Walkin’ in My Place (Road of Tears) [Mansion on the Hill]” more clearly identifies the song as a direct descendent of the After the Gold Rush rager “Southern Man.” Ultimately, Fu##in’ Up is less a snapshot of a specific event than a proudly moldy monument to Crazy Horse’s long-may-you-runitude. There’s no stage banter, and the between-song applause is edited out of the mix as it was on Rust Never Sleeps. The lack of contextual detail puts the focus squarely on Crazy Horse’s incandescent noise and slack yet unfailingly steady momentum. As a result, Fu##in’ Up makes a convincing case for Ragged Glory as the definitive Crazy Horse album, showcasing the group in their purest, crudest state, without any of the counter-balancing pop singles or acoustic reprieves that colored more hallowed classics like Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and Zuma. And with the Fu##in’ Up versions, the traditional divide between Neil’s melodic accessibility and avant-grunge odysseys is completely blurred, while the long songs get to grind on even longer. Whether it’s a withering anthem like “Broken Circle (Over and Over)” or a tension-wracked 15-minute workout like “A Chance on Love (Love and Only Love),” Crazy Horse approach each song as an extended late-night drive on a lost highway, with Neil’s needling solos serving as the high-beam guiding light, and each verse/chorus passage appearing like a fleeting sign of civilization before we slip back into the desert. On the cover of Ragged Glory, we see a photo of Crazy Horse jamming away at Neil’s Broken Arrow Ranch in Northern California, transforming the vaulted, wood-lined space into their own private cathedral of sound. It’s a hermetic scene that couldn’t be further removed from a posh VIP-only party for one of Canada’s wealthiest men held at a popular downtown Toronto bar. But the beauty of Fu##in’ Up is that Neil Young and Crazy Horse play as though they’re still locked in the barn. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Japandroids,Fate & Alcohol,5.9,Rock,"You ever see a group of strangers in a bar so overcome with emotion—maybe the Bills won or they got the dream job; maybe the Bills lost or they just got laid off—that they start to spontaneously sing together, their off-key howls somehow finding a kind of universal tune? Everything is a shout chorus. They sing because they’ve been crushed by a first love but they’re ready to give up all this—the beers, the boys, the game—to experience the rush of young romance again. Sometimes they’re singing “Mr. Brightside” by the Killers; sometimes it’s “American Girl” by Tom Petty. If they’re really drunk or it’s St. Patrick’s Day (or both), they’re singing “The Boys Are Back in Town” by Thin Lizzy. Man, that must feel so good. Japandroids are a band premised on these nights: dreaming about them, living them to the fullest, reminiscing about them fondly afterwards. In their full-throated commitment to debauchery and brotherhood, they counterintuitively avoided the pitfalls of toxic masculinity, celebrating the ecstatic possibilities of hanging out instead of lamenting its contemporary limitations. Despite what Tony Soprano said, Japandroids made “remember when” sound like the highest form of conversation, a lost art of keeping the fire burning. But nostalgia as fuel is always a risky proposition: Once it’s burned dry, it’s hard to keep the lights on. Fate & Alcohol, announced as Japandroids’ final album, strives to rekindle the same spirit that made their first three records sound like the best version of a night of drunken revelry. But with too few innovations and too many well-worn tropes, it lands like those two lonely guys at the bar trying to keep the party going after closing time. In the seven years since 2017’s Near to the Wild Heart of Life, at least one of the boys (vocalist and guitarist Brian King) finally left town (Vancouver, BC), to become a man: married, one year sober, living in Michigan, with a baby on the way. This has, unsurprisingly, posed a series of existential threats for the band: How can they reproduce the lightning-in-a-bottle enthusiasm they created when King recorded in the same room as drummer and backing vocalist David Prowse? How can they sing about “bikini island” and wanting to “French kiss some French girls” when they have wives back at home? How can they keep lamenting about how “nothing changes,” when more accurately, nothing has been the same for them in over a decade? They had already begun to wrestle with these thoughts on their prior album, replacing their local watering hole with lyrics about every party city across the USA. If that album was a bit sluggish, they seem to have overcorrected on Fate & Alcohol, simplifying their girls-and-beers formula to its most basic and hoping that power chords and a few overeager “whoa-ohs” can fill the gaps. “Positively 34th Street” does a disservice to its Bob Dylan forebear with the thinnest outline of the dive bar version of a manic pixie dream girl: “A walkin’, talkin’, drinkin’, smokin’, gamblin’ kinda girl,” King sings in a pained register that sounds somewhere between Mac McCaughan with his nose plugged and Ned Flanders covering Morgan Wallen. Across the album, women suffer the worst lyrical fate, becoming mannequins for empty signifiers like a “sequin dress, Chanel No. 5” on “Alice.” At their best, Japandroids appeal just as much to women as to the dudes they’ve been so commonly marketed to—believe it or not, we are just as often searching for oblivion at the bottom of a Miller High Life—but here, they’re rendered as lazy stereotypes: the vixen, the girl next door, the wisecracking “ma’am” doling out advice on “Chicago.” The strongest songs replace these wincingly obvious descriptors with vaguer gestures at infatuation and heartbreak: “Forgive me if I’m suspicious, but it’s rarely a social call,” Prowse sings on “A Gaslight Anthem,” warily addressing an old flame. Even through his weary bitterness there’s a hint of excitement, backed by guitars that seem to stretch out upon some endless reverberating highway, that recalls the unabashed exuberance of early Japandroids. “Fugitive Summer,” which has the familiar into-the-red distortion that made the band sound at once compressed and infinite, is the closest the album gets to the transcendent rafter-swinging energy of Celebration Rock—if you close your eyes when King sings about sipping a mickey of liquor “slow-leh,” it almost feels like 2012 again. These small successes only make the rest of the album—from the bad pun of “Eye Contact High” to the predictable refrain of “D&T” (it will make you wish it stood for “death and taxes,” but no, it’s unfortunately “drinking and thinking”)—feel egregiously phoned in. Even the “whoa-ohs” feel canned, as if generated from a Japandroids soundboard. In recent interviews the band has admitted to writing albums merely as cover to go on tour; with no tour slated for this final album, it almost seems like an exercise in futility. On Fate & Alcohol, Japandroids deliver the conviction that made their early records so great, but cannot overcome the palpable mismatch between their current lives and the characters their newest songs portray. Barroom anthems that once felt inspired because they sounded so lived in, so viscerally first-person, come across here like a bad impression of what a single twentysomething might want to hear. There is a fundamentally happy ending to Japandroids—one where they leave the bar and find the kind of love about which they’d once yelled to the heavens. If only their final album reflected just how far they’ve come. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Nathan Bowles Trio,Are Possible,7.3,Folk/Country,"What constitutes a jam band? Do you need guitar solos that last the length of an Adult Swim show? Do you need concert attendees huffing balloons and taking LSD? Do you need to hire a lighting designer so sick that Justin Bieber steals him? Not to sound like the old hippie approaching hour five of the campfire lecture, but it’s all about the groove, man. The Nathan Bowles Trio’s Are Possible renders these questions moot by stripping this music of all frills and signifiers. This is three people in a room, conversing through instrumental mastery. Bowles, who plays banjo, doesn’t need squawking solos or balloons or drugs or a light show. He doesn’t need vocals—hell, he doesn’t even need a guitarist, though sometimes the instrument adds a nice flavor. On Are Possible, Bowles reunites with double bassist Casey Toll and drummer Rex McMurry (of CAVE) for the first time since 2018’s Plainly Mistaken, and though the sound is more direct now, the message remains the same. Plainly Mistaken foregrounded experimentation, pushing further into free improvisation. Here, the group digs deeper into the core melodies from which the songs are built. Great jams need not be heady or flashy: These exercises are live-time encapsulations of the awe invoked when one idea perfectly informs the next. Despite the spontaneity that exists between Bowles and his bandmates, the trio relies on a few tricks to move its songs from one section to the next. Opener “Dappled” immediately sets Appalachian folk music in conversation with jazz and modern minimalism. The song’s groove is contoured by Toll’s dexterous bass. Throughout the album, Toll, who plays with Jake Xerxes Fussell and Mount Moriah, serves as a counterpoint to the music’s mesmerizing repetitions. He provides the rhythmic and melodic tension, as he does on “Dappled,” where he riffs off Bowles’ banjo progression and dips between the pockets of McMurry’s groove. This practice is best illustrated on the album’s emotional centerpiece, “Gimme My Shit,” which stands out thanks to the joyous nature of the hook. A bouncing banjo riff contrasts with the comforting warmth of snare drum clicks; rhythmic chords occasionally give way to a shining melody, like sun slowly emerging from clouds. As the song marches along in 6/8 time, Toll provides the steady anchor, allowing Bowles to hint at the main refrain before finally landing on it. The eventual release is all the more powerful, as the duo engage in a descending phrase highlighted by a cymbal crash that creates the album’s most powerful musical motif. Banjo-led instrumentals that pay homage to Appalachian folk music is a hyper-specific niche, but Bowles and his band never allow their preferred sounds to hem in their experiments. This music leads in all directions, unfurling with patience and reserve to reveal the balance between repetition and deviation. Are Possible shows that rural folk, cosmic new age music, and hard-charging rock aren’t only relatable, but can be inextricably linked. The jam is only the beginning.

Fana Hues,Moth,7.5,Pop/R&B,"Fana Hues’ voice can only be described as romantic. Whether she’s singing about new love or loneliness, her timbre often transmits a sumptuous sense of desire. It bounces jauntily through the dubby piano and flirtatious sway of Tyler, the Creator’s “SWEET / I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE,” but it also swims through rivers of uncertainty and reverb-drenched guitar on 2022’s “dayxday,” always brimming with hope like a spring sunrise. That aura has surrounded her music, starting from her early years singing in her family band and in school productions of The Wiz to her first two solo albums, 2020’s Hues and 2022’s flora + fana. Hues has said she wants to “showcase the full spectrum of emotion” in her work, which unfurls through her hummingbird-delicate vocal runs. Her third studio album Moth—short for Matters of the Heart—shows Hues at her most assured, standing on firmer sentimental ground as a writer, singer, and lover. In the past, the content of Hues’ love songs often scraped against their brighter presentation. flora + fana’s “breakfast” feels like gossamer—glittering, doo-wop guitar strums succumbing to a wall of lush bass and synths—but in its pure wistfulness, its story of post-relationship sorrow reads more like a hollowed-out Harlequin romance novel. “Must’ve left my heart where my head is…Woke up in the wrong day; forgot breakfast,” she says sweetly, forcing herself through the motions. But Moth largely moves with more clarity and confidence. In the bridge of “Gone Again,” she’s approaching a similar situation from the other side. This time, she’s the one questioning where the relationship stands, content to work through any fallout: “I know you’re here with me, we’re fine/And what we are won’t be defined/Still I need you to say ‘You’re mine baby.’” Uncertainty still lingers, but this time, she’s the one calling the shots. Like the insect the album is named after, in her metamorphosis, Hues molts fear and doubt—and embraces a lust for life. Take the dancefloor-ready single “Rental,” where she compares a casual fling to the thrill of joyriding in a fancy car: “Let’s forget the safety/Ain’t no destination/Ain’t no course/Don’t it feel better when it ain’t yours?” Or consider “What Speaks,” which ditches metaphor entirely and asks a potential partner what exactly their desires are in and out of the bedroom. Hues isn’t just welcoming the future, she’s relishing in it. Producer Josh Grant—who has credits on nearly every song—offers up waves of hearty digital and acoustic funk that wash these mini-affairs in vibrant technicolor. Boldness doesn’t just come through in the production or the lyrics, but also in the way Hues manipulates her dulcet voice. There are a handful of times on Moth where she pushes her higher register to its limits, where it matches the layered emotions of her writing. The hook of “Sweet Like” stacks vocals in the middle of a tornado of drums and bass, amplifying her seductive demands for attention. On lead single “Paper Tigers,” competition for a potential love interest boils over into a hook where she belts for her life, channeling Tina Turner and Janelle Monáe. Explosive moments like these are few and far between, but it’s nice to hear as much variety in her delivery as there is in the writing. That’s not to say Moth ever gets boring or repetitive. Hues already plumbs the depths of her heart compellingly, but her writing gleams even brighter here, like a gemstone catching stray fragments of light. Life still has its ups and downs; relationships bloom and wither; decisions can feel like life-or-death scenarios. But Hues is no longer a victim of circumstance or meet-cutes gone wrong. She’s fully at the helm and willing to accept the unpredictable with grace. “Matters of my heart never looked so strange/Focused on the things that I cannot change/Who am I to judge what my God has made?” she says on the breezy late-album highlight “Til Morning Come.” With Moth, Hues isn’t shying away from life anymore. She’s ready to find love and self-actualization in the messes and successes of her future.",0,"June 18, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fana-hues-moth/
ZULI,Lambda,7.9,Electronic,"For as long as he’s been putting out music, ZULI has stayed two steps ahead. The Egyptian producer switches up styles not just from record to record, but often from song to song. His debut EP encompassed noise-rap beats, lo-fi techno, Detroit-inspired futurism, and crickets chirping over bell tones. The leaps between releases are even greater: After the extreme abstraction of his moody 2018 LP Terminal, in which hip-hop and footwork were pulled apart at the seams, ZULI sank his teeth into a set of no-holds-barred breakbeat smashers on 2021’s ALL CAPS EP. A Cairo native, the artist born Ahmed El Ghazoly spent much of his childhood in London before returning to the Egyptian capital, a double displacement that he says gave him his sense of restlessness. “I think the move between countries instilled an urge to rebel against my surroundings,” he told an interviewer in 2021. He was talking about his preference for “niche” sounds over popular styles, but he’s just as reluctant to relax into a niche of his own making. Now, on Lambda—his first major release in six years—he changes course yet again, jettisoning the rhythmic force and focus of his previous records in favor of a spellbinding fusion of atmosphere and texture that spills over with nebulous emotion. Lambda opens like a sunrise over a ruined city, vast chords of cinematic scope and symphonic grandeur swelling and morphing. A lurching electro rhythm rises and fades, speeding and slowing before abruptly falling silent, but what really drives the action are the tiny vibrations rippling across the surface of the music, a riot of unpredictability. ZULI’s productions have always felt unstable, but they’ve never been more precarious than they are here. His chords are a swampy morass; his textures shudder like ground liquefying in an earthquake, minuscule particles suddenly gushing in streams and bursts. This palette—a thick slurry of buzzing synths and blown-out distortion—carries across the breadth of the album, lending a feeling of uniform intent that makes it the most cohesive release in his catalog. Despite the extremity of the sound design, Lambda frequently feels like ZULI’s attempt at pop. In “Trachea,” a heavily processed voice groans and gurgles over chords that gleam with the imposing majesty of Jean-Michel Jarre; in “Syzygy,” UK-born, Hamburg-based performer MICHAELBRAILEY’s shrill falsetto soars above a shapeshifting backdrop of synths and piano that’s reminiscent of Arca’s mutant assemblages. The majority of the album’s tracks feature some sort of singing, usually woven deep into the gelatinous mix. “Syzygy” kicks off an interconnected three-song suite in which voice and synths alike are ground to dust; in “Plateau,” a highlight, Abdullah Miniawy’s mournful incantations twist like smoke, twined with melancholy clarinet and a tremolo figure that delightfully, however accidentally, recalls the Smiths’ “How Soon Is Now.” Only once, on “10000 (Papercuts, Pt. 1),” do the vocals feel like the main event, as MICHAELBRAILEY intones a mantra of self-doubt and desperation over a roiling sea of molten bass and chimes. The song’s overt drama lays all its cards on the table; it lacks the intrigue of murkier, more ambiguous tracks like “Fahsil Qusseer,” an overcast trip-hop etude built around a poem written and recited by the producer’s father, Osama Elghazoly, or “Ast,” in which Coby Sey raps meditative, free-associative verses over a tape-warped music-box beat that becomes increasingly tangled over its two-minute run. (ZULI’s twisted productions work remarkably well with relatively straight-ahead rapping; I’d love to hear what he might do in collaboration with someone like Armand Hammer’s billy woods and Elucid.) The sense that these mercurial soundscapes could suddenly veer off in any direction—careening from distortion-encrusted power ambient to illbient tone poem or electroacoustic composition—is part of what makes them so compelling. Even after many listens, Lambda’s abrupt shifts in both style and emotional resonance remain surprising. It took me ages to pinpoint the heavy beats running beneath tracks like “Trachea” and “Release +ϕ,” given the rolling waves of synth swallowing them up. ZULI has previously pushed back against expectations that he should somehow represent Cairo in his music: “They always try to inject political narratives, projecting their own ideas of what an Egyptian musician should be, and I feel like the concept of ‘an Egyptian musician’ is kind of ridiculous considering that we’re like 120 million at the moment,” he complained in that 2021 interview. “I don’t really consider myself an Egyptian, I’m just a musician.” On Lambda, he takes his resistance one step further. In refusing to deliver the kind of club productions with which he’s long been identified, he has created an album that sounds breathtakingly original, even by his standards.",0,"July 22, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/zuli-lambda/
Iasos,Inter-Dimensional Music,8.3,Experimental,"It’s a typical scene in Marin County, the affluent expanse north of San Francisco where countless hippies settled down after the Summer of Love. Iasos leans on a deck railing as a bountiful Northern California landscape sweeps behind his lanky frame and Bob Ross perm. A trombone and mute rest beside him. Every now and then the man lets out a high-pitched giggle, not unlike Tom Hulce’s Mozart in Amadeus: appropriate given that the film spoke of Mozart’s talent as divine, and this man is steadfastly convinced that the music in his head was beamed there by an angelic, inter-dimensional entity named Vista. “I feel honored that I’m working with him,” he titters, elated as a Rolling Stone on his way back from a session with Muddy Waters. Iasos is being interviewed for a 1979 documentary by students at Marin College, four years after his debut, Inter-Dimensional Music, one of the first albums to pair new age philosophy with the glittering, celestial style of music that would soon come to bear the same name. The term initially referred to a set of unrelated movements that believed in a coming new age of spiritual enlightenment and human development—influenced by various Eastern philosophies, turn-of-the-century spiritual ideas like Theosophy, and 1950s UFO religions—many of which gained traction among the post-hippie milieu that had recently migrated to Marin. If you can sit through the Iasos interview without your eyes glazing over, you’ll hear a lot of these threads converge. Even his best friends never learned his real name, which was not made public until after his death last year. Those friends recall a happy and jocular man who wasn’t always easy to meet on an earthly plane of conversation. “Let's put it this way,” said one friend decades later. “I cannot imagine anybody less likely to come to a Super Bowl party than Iasos.” Iasos was born in 1947 in Greece to Jewish parents. His father was the only one on his side of the family to survive the Holocaust. When Iasos was four, his family moved to upstate New York, where he eventually attended Cornell University, playing in a bossa nova group called the Nova Shadow Quartet. Around this time, he started hearing what he called “paradise music” in his head, whose origin he could not trace and which he lacked the means to realize. After consulting with a psychic, he decided the music came from Vista, the Elohim of the Fifth Ray, whom he compared in interviews throughout his life to an “older brother.” Jettisoning his initial plan to go to grad school and study anthropology, Iasos moved across the country to Berkeley, California, then found a houseboat in Sausalito, on the same harbor that inspired Otis Redding to write “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay.” He became an active figure in the local scene: his early credits include flute on the debut album by the Grateful Dead-affiliated Rowan Brothers and chimes on the self-titled album by singer-songwriter Pamela Polland. But he remained focused on the sounds he was hearing in his head. Living off cans of beans and borrowing what equipment he needed to document these transmissions from the higher realm, he jury-rigged a crude home studio and recorded what would become Inter-Dimensional Music. Though Iasos claimed steadfastly that this music came to him from on high, he did reluctantly admit a few earthly influences: Debussy, Ravel, Jimi Hendrix, exotica great Martin Denny. The early-’70s Bay Area where he worked was a hub for music unbound by rhythm, home to the San Francisco Tape Music Center and the Mills College music program that boasted faculty like Terry Riley and Pandit Pran Nath—music that had trickled down from the academic avant-garde into more accessible, rock-adjacent forms like German kosmische and Brian Eno’s earliest ambient works. Iasos never cited any of these artists as influences, but his music fit naturally within this zeitgeist. Stephen Hill, a Bay Area DJ who established the Hearts of Space radio show in 1973 to broadcast what he broadly called “contemplative music,” claims the new age genre was one of the first made possible by home recording. Before it became clear in the late ’70s and early ’80s that there was a market for this music, musicians had to record and release it themselves. Most of the genre’s earliest gems are private-press and small-batch oddities. Recorded on a reel-to-reel, Inter-Dimensional Music has an alluring, slightly fried quality. It sounds faded and corroded, very distant from the sources of its sounds, as if it’s traveled a long way to reach us. This is insubstantial music by design, evocative of flickering phenomena like flames and shooting stars. From the opening comet-whoosh of “Libra Sunrise,” the album makes clear its almost single-minded pursuit of transcendent beauty. Save for “The Bubble Massage,” a proto-ASMR submersion into aqueous sound, there is almost no low end to speak of. It exists in the same register as birdsong, the voices of children, as Iasos’ curious Mozartean laugh. While ambient music often works at a glacial pace, this music leaps through the air, free from gravity. Iasos loves slide guitar, which allows him to create incredible sweeps and gentle flutters. The flute, instrument of his childhood, dances freely, conjuring images of satyrs wreathed in laurels. (Vista is not the only god Iasos has worked with; he claims to have received a musical scale from Pan.) The piano does not sound real at all—it’s pearly, warped, slightly too lustrous, a memory of a piano. All these elements combine on “Lueena Coast,” the album’s most stunning track, which opens with scattered piano arpeggios and leaps into grand pirouettes of flute. Iasos’ voice can be faintly heard in the background, mouthing syllables through a thick sheet of reverb. Avian whoops and titters abound in the margins of Inter-Dimensional Music, making explicit Iasos’ debt to Martin Denny’s exotica records of the 1950s, which used birdsong to put American listeners in the mind of some faraway tropical isle. “Lanua Cove,” available only on the original vinyl pressing, centers a conspicuously Denny-like vibraphone; though a distant, aqueous cymbal gives it some interest, it’s easier to think of tiki bars than transcendence while listening. “Osiris Bull-Man & Elephant Walk,” a cartoonish approximation of “Ancient Egyptian” music, is the track that’s aged the worst. Iasos’ claim that these pseudo-Arabic scales implied a connection with the age of the pharaohs made clear his music was not immune to the infantilizing streak of exoticism that persists in new age, rooted in the idea that non-Western cultures and spiritualities are more in touch with some fundamental truth about the universe. It’s only thanks to the soupy mix and production grit that “Osiris” actually manages to sound a bit ancient, weathered by time and dust; once the ersatz Eastern melodies fade out, it meanders its way into a surprisingly strong psych-rock groove that’s the only audible instance of Iasos’ influence from Hendrix. Inter-Dimensional Music doesn’t ever really sound like divine music. It sounds like a human’s approximation of divine music using the limited tools at their disposal. That’s what makes it undeniably cheesy at times, and also what makes it work. It’s a strange thing to say about music so outwardly languid, but it also feels urgent, as if this person was doing their damnedest to transcribe the cosmic music in their mind before it flickered out. The influences from the likes of Debussy and Denny, then, could be interpreted as Iasos’ way of filling in the gaps. Even his chintzy imitations of nature, like the water sounds on “The Bubble Massage” or the canned birdsong effects all over the album, have a hyperreal quality that’s spookier and more alluring than a pristine field recording would’ve been. Iasos initially released Inter-Dimensional Music in a limited-run vinyl pressing, then quickly followed it up in 1976 with a tape version that included the seven-minute “Rainbow Canyon.” The version on streaming is the Japanese CD repress from 2005; this release combines most of the earlier versions in an hour of music but excludes “Lanua Cove,” still not available digitally. There’s no definitive version of Inter-Dimensional Music; the music’s haphazard presentation across different documents feels true to its visionary origin. Inter-Dimensional Music came out a full half decade before the market for new age music was established. Precedents like Paul Horn’s Inside, Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells, and Irv Teibel’s Environments had sold a lot of copies, but by explicitly presenting his music within a new age philosophical cosmos, Iasos pointed towards the intertwining of beatless, contemplative music and alternative spiritual practice that would hold the key to the music’s eventual commercial breakthrough. Albums like Inter-Dimensional Music and Steven Halpern’s 1975 Spectrum Suite, which featured Iasos and was presented as an aid for chakra-aligned healing, spent years sitting in alternative bookstores and healing shops before it became clear there was a formidable audience for this kind of music. In the 1980s, new age went mainstream: NPR picked up Hearts of Space for national syndication in 1983; the Grammys created an award for the genre in ’87; the new age label Windham Hill raked in tens of millions in sales. Iasos never cashed in on the new age boom. Either unwilling or unable to make the same leap to Grammy considerations and gold certifications as his friend and collaborator Halpern, he continued to live in Marin, putting out classics like Angelic Music and Elixir but protecting his real name and personal life and performing only intermittently. He earned some infamy from a 1989 study at Plymouth State University, which suggested that “The Angels of Comfort” from Angelic Music, along with selections from Brian Eno and Jonn Serrie, sounded like what patients heard during near-death experiences. And he kept on recording whatever paradise music was still in his head, with results ranging from the stunning (Jeweled Space) to the terrifically strange (Bora Bora 2000, which alternates long synth meditations with synthesized tiki-lounge tracks just south of Zappa’s Jazz From Hell). He spent the last few years of his life in Maui, where he died in January. Inter-Dimensional Music might have remained a historical footnote if not for the enthusiasm of American experimentalists 30 years later. In the 2000s and 2010s, a crop of underground artists took inspiration from early new age and synthesizer music, and by 2012, Iasos was playing venues in Bushwick to noiseniks like Emeralds’ Mark McGuire. A year later his music appeared on I Am The Center, the Light in the Attic compilation that kicked off the new age revival in earnest. The Celestial Soul Portrait compilation on Numero Group is a solid survey of his work; featuring a sepia slice-of-life photo on the cover rather than the garish temples-and-rainbows imagery Iasos himself loved, it endears itself to listeners like those in the Bushwick crowd: crate-diggers and musical omnivores who may have no investment in new age concepts beyond their appreciation for the music. New age, once anathema for anyone who considered themselves a savvy music fan, has come thoroughly back around. It’s hard to begrudge people for turning to music with a focus on positivity and healing in a time when the world looks like it’s ending. Speaking from his idyllic deck in Marin, Iasos spoke of a “cosmic push,” an imminent age of human spiritual and artistic growth brought on by beings like Vista. It seems harder than ever to imagine humanity discovering a collective selfless good—something that would allow the reversal of climate change, perhaps, and keep the lush California landscape around him from catching fire. Yet Iasos insisted throughout his life that such a transformative event was right around the corner. The songs on Inter-Dimensional Music sparkle with the promise of this new world, however distant.",0,"June 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/iasos-inter-dimensional-music/
Normani,DOPAMINE,7.4,Pop/R&B,"Whether they admit it or not, every former girl-group singer wants their solo debut to hit like “2003 Beyoncé performing ‘Crazy in Love.’” Four years ago, Normani came remarkably close with the sprightly R&B track “Motivation.” The single, and its Aaliyah-inspired follow-up “Wild Side,” capitalized on the pageantry that made her stand out in Fifth Harmony. After two unforgettable VMA performances—the handstand-into-a-split in 2019 and the steamy Janet Jackson homage in 2021—Normani laid low; both parents were battling cancer, and shifting management due to creative differences didn’t make anything easier. DOPAMINE, her highly anticipated debut-slash-comeback album, still can’t shake the anonymity of her ensemble days, but it lays the foundation for what Normani will be known for: her Southern roots and a voice as plush as a pair of fuzzy dice. Rather than the bubbly pop of “Motivation,” which Normani has notably tried to distance herself from, DOPAMINE trades in the suave R&B of her childhood. “Lights On” is reminiscent of the sultry yet danceable croons of noughties Janet. “Insomnia,” co-written by none other than Brandy, could slot into the R&B star’s 2002 album Full Moon. The writing is solid and witty (“Don’t even address me unless you gon’ undress me”) but musically, the primary tasting notes are understated familiarity and reverence for the past. Normani’s smooth vocals are the only quality truly unique to her, and at times even that induces a highway hypnosis effect. Normani is at her best when she is brash and animated, channeling sounds and flows from her Southern youth. She’s got ties to Atlanta, New Orleans, and Houston all over the album: “Bling-bling-blaow” she sings of her platinum records and iced-out jewelry over a funky bassline on horn-laden opener “Big Boy,” complemented by Starrah’s Auto-Tune’d flexes. “Candy Paint” has the potential to eclipse the braggadocious aura of “Big Boy” but Normani’s laid-back flow becomes monotonous even when her tempo quickens. She leans heavily into her Texas roots on the album highlight “Still,” when she flips a testosterone-filled Mike Jones sample into a strip-club anthem for the ladies kicking up their feet and making it rain hundreds. DOPAMINE is a solid reintroduction to Normani’s sultrier side that, unfortunately, currently exists in a similar conundrum as Dua Lipa post-Future Nostalgia: Her mysteriously cool it-girl persona is thrilling in three-minute doses, but after a couple of tracks with big hooks, you come across some filler. On DOPAMINE, the house-lite of “Take My Time,” the Kelly Rowland’s “Commander” dupe “Little Secrets,” and the James Blake-assisted “Tantrums” feel obligated to demonstrate versatility through genre experimentation. At times it feels like a solo artist searching for an identity through sound, not always through songwriting. Though she has writing credits on a majority of the album, Normani’s solo songs often feel plucked from a communal pile. As an alum of one of the biggest American girl groups, a survivor of Hurricane Katrina, and a person who has had to confront mortality and celebrity from a young age, Normani’s story seems ripe for an album format—once she’s ready to tell it.",0,"June 18, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/normani-dopamine/
English Teacher,This Could Be Texas,7.4,Rock,"On This Could Be Texas, English Teacher outline a landscape burdened by prejudice, the cost-of-living crisis, mental health issues. The band’s name couldn’t be more apt—it’s here to school us in 50 minutes. They sweep up myriad literary and cultural references and dabble in several genres to dole out endlessly twisting melodies. If a synth flutters into mellow guitar rock, into wandering piano, into drums, out of drums, into layered vocals, with a squeaky guitar on top, you’ve about covered the dextrous three minutes of track one. This Could Be Texas takes a wider angle than English Teacher’s more personal 2022 EP Polyawkward and 2021 song “R&B,” which gained significant traction online (and is reimagined here). “R&B” harnesses singer Lily Fontaine’s experience as a frontwoman of color (“Despite appearances, I haven’t got the voice for R&B/Even though I’ve seen more Colour Shows than KEXPs”) in service of a larger message. Bouncing between disdain and rage, many of the debut album’s best moments adapt those small, personal pieces that defined Polyawkward and blow them up to fill out a long-player. English Teacher can’t leave a song alone: Not a track goes by without a twist or complication, whether a time-signature change, an instrumental flourish, or a sudden wall of sound. Those quirks are most effective on “Broken Biscuits,” where Fontaine’s dry tone makes things like government negligence and societal breakdown appear droll rather than devastating. But the energy starts to pick up, and she becomes more insistent. The move between meandering, Jon Brion-esque runs with spots of bright, plunking keys to sudden sped-up sections, where the vocals struggle to keep up, are propulsive: She spits out complaints, places blame, and explodes with anger at uncaring rulers. Most promising, and core to This Could Be Texas, is the band’s interest in melding indie-prog, rock, folk electronica, and post-punk into a new package. It’s something akin to Black Country, New Road’s Live at Bush Hall: an attempt at massive, epic-scale work, a post-rock entrée with the wingspan of the genre’s greats. And like Bush Hall, it’s a first step in the band’s imagination, hinting toward something more explosive to come. Take “Not Everybody Gets to Go to Space.” Evoking some Elon Musk-type figure, offhand jokes like “If everybody got to go to space/All of its bars would have a line” seem to fall flat. But as the song progresses to those who did make it to space, the music shifts from spare drums and bass to a rollicking backbeat, pulling in another voice and building into an echoey, bassline-built chasm with overlaid vocals and a persistent melody, blanketed by Fontaine’s shaky yelling. The re-recorded “R&B” is also significantly more intense. As the backing instrumentation ramps up with a stronger bassline and chunkier feel, Fontaine is more forward, too. Separating just the slightest bit from the impulse to speak-sing, she sounds more in control of the song. Like much of the album, it’s full of “I ams” and “I’m nots,” culminating in a question: “If I have stuff to write, then why don’t I just write it for me?” The idea of ownership makes for some of This Could Be Texas’ strongest moments. The keening of “You Blister My Paint” intensifies the song’s post-breakup anguish, striking the album’s most personal tone. Notably sung and not spoken—sometimes airy and at others almost jazzy—the gentle piano and vocal distortions are a heart-wrenching package. The grandness is baked in, rather than applied: Every choice rings out with intention, hinting at an even more compelling story waiting in the wings.

Godspeed You! Black Emperor,"“NO TITLE AS OF 13 FEBRUARY 2024 28,340 DEAD”",7.8,Rock / Experimental,"Since their formation in Montreal 30 years ago, Godspeed You! Black Emperor have come to seem timeless, their imposing musical aesthetic and DIY modus operandi wholly unaffected by changes in technology or the music industry. Unless you’re reading their liner-note communiques closely, there’s little on a formal level to distinguish a 1999 Godspeed record from a 2021 one. But the title of Godspeed’s eighth album instantly dates itself—and that’s the point. As textual exercises go, “NO TITLE AS OF 13 FEBRUARY 2024 28,340 DEAD” is like The Zone of Interest condensed to album-spine format, contrasting the mundane formalities of naming a record with the horrors unfolding in Gaza at the time of its conception while also forcing us to consider where that number stands today. The cover art conveys a similarly defeatist air—in lieu of the artfully blurred photographs or evocative illustrations of old, we get a stark picture of gear, furniture, and dirty cutlery strewn about a hermetic jam space, as if the band was too numbed to come up with any other ideas. But while discussions of Godspeed’s music often revolve around their staggering quiet-to-cataclysmic ascents, the band’s real power lies in their emotional dynamism, and the way the tone of their work can so easily turn from tragic to triumphant. From their earliest days, Godspeed have performed with Super-8 films projected behind them, and at a certain point in each show, the flickering images of cityscapes give way to a simple handwritten message—“HOPE”—that looks like it was scrawled by someone trying to hold onto their sanity deep into a lengthy prison sentence. But on their most recent albums, Godspeed have treated “HOPE” more like a Bat signal: As the world’s doom spiral has accelerated, Godspeed have responded with the most elating music in their canon. And while the title “NO TITLE AS OF 13 FEBRUARY 2024 28,340 DEAD” provides an unspeakably grim reminder of the context that birthed it, the music sounds more defiantly exultant than ever. “NO TITLE” is not without its mournful, meditative passages (could an interstitial track called “Broken Spires at Dead Kapital” be anything but?), but the album more frequently provides accessible and expedient pathways to its moments of communal ecstasy. It’s a record that welcomes you in rather than making you work for it: With its valorous guitar intro, sweetly swelling strings, and gently jazzy drums wafting in like a cool breeze, the opening “Sun Is a Hole, Sun Is Vapors” has no interest in scaling the same heights as Godspeed’s most volcanic epics; rather, it invites you to savor an experience that’s as simple and profound as a sunrise. Likewise, the bookending closer “Grey Rubble - Green Shoots” is another relative rarity in the Godspeed canon, packing the slow-climb/crescendo/comedown schematic of a 20-minute suite into a relatively concise 6:57. By Godspeed standards, this feels practically like a pop single (and all the more so when you realize its central circular melody kinda sounds like “Chopsticks”). But even the tentpole tracks that stretch past 10 minutes spend less time setting the post-apocalyptic scene and instead get right down to the business of pulling us out of it. Like many Godspeed set pieces before it, “Babys in a Thundercloud” marinates in an ominous, black-sky atmosphere befitting the album’s war-torn title. Then a reverberating guitar line—part desolate desert twang, part static-hit shoegaze surge—begins the uplift process, and by the halfway point, the band hits the sort of overwhelming emotional peak where you’re not sure if the correct response is to cheer or weep. By contrast, “Pale Spectator Takes Photographs” is less interested in seizing your heartstrings than punching your guts, with doomy riffs that position it as a slow-motion sequel to the band’s 2013 klezmer-metal colossus “Mladic.” But just as the track erupts into clanging alarm-bell bedlam, Godspeed introduce a soothing, string-swept melody, as if shooting a firehose on a raging inferno. More than any Godspeed record to date, “NO TITLE AS OF 13 FEBRUARY 2024 28,340 DEAD” feels less like a deliberate, intricately structured composition than the natural, intuitive result of friends seated in a room together, hanging on to each other, and finding salvation in the adrenalizing rush of a great riff. Nowhere is that sense of camaraderie and catharsis felt more acutely than on the soul-purifying centerpiece “Raindrops Cast in Lead,” where Godspeed rally around a galvanizing guitar fanfare en route to transforming themselves into the world’s mightiest Velvet Underground cover band, riding a breakneck locomotive rhythm toward the light on the horizon. Thirty years on from their formation, Godspeed remain as elusive and enigmatic an entity as ever, but their messaging has never been more clear: When mere hope isn’t enough to chase the darkness away, go straight for the joy.

Ghost Dubs,Damaged,7.4,Electronic,"Back in 1994, tasked with curating the fourth volume of Virgin’s ambient series, Kevin Richard Martin coined a new subgenre when he dubbed the compilation Isolationism. Less a hard-and-fast category than a general air of desolation that might crop up in any number of contexts—drone, post-rock, industrial, and more—isolationism cast a long shadow across subsequent decades of dark ambient. Yet Martin himself didn’t linger there. Though he has made many different types of music under many different aliases over the years, he became most closely identified with the industrial-strength dancehall that he records as the Bug. That range makes Michael Fiedler a natural fit for Martin’s Pressure label. Using aliases like Tokyo Tower and Jah Schulz, the Stuttgart producer has been turning out dub reggae for nearly two decades. But in 2020 Fiedler began putting out a series of drone-driven ambient albums under his own name, tapping into the claustrophobic dread that haunted the original Isolation comp. The two sides of his musical persona now come together on his debut album as Ghost Dubs, a distillation of ambient dub into a wispy, wraithlike form. Fiedler has been moving toward this sound for a while. On 2020’s Dub Over Science, he slowed his tempos and muffled his bass, luxuriating in the murk. But on Damaged, he takes that process to new extremes. This is dub compressed to the point of abstraction, everything extraneous stripped away. A uniform palette carries across the album: ultra-low sub-bass pressure, hi-hats sanded down to silvery streaks, an omnipresent crackling fizz. Monochrome chords slosh back and forth like water in a bucket; whatever they began as—guitar? keyboard?—now they’re just fleeting smudges smeared across the tape. The bass is remarkable—even at a relatively low volume, it seems to vibrate the walls, turning the room into a larger-than-life speaker cabinet. Yet Ghost Dubs’ sound is also remarkably refined, accentuating the contrast between crystalline details and a swollen low end that wants to devour everything in its path. This is by no means an original sound—but then, things associated with reggae rarely are. The most obvious antecedent is the music that Basic Channel’s Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald made as Rhythm & Sound, shifting from the club vestiges of their Chain Reaction label—home to ethereal recordings from Porter Ricks, Vainqueur, Vladislav Delay, and Shinichi Atobe—to a more vaporous vision of ambient dub, which gradually abandoned the “techno” half of dub techno. There are also echoes of Deepchord Presents Echospace’s The Coldest Season, a canonical ambient dub album from 2007; Pole’s alternately lilting and lurching studies in throb and crackle; and Andy Stott albums like Passed Me By and We Stay Together, whose air of Sisyphean effort anticipates the trudging uphill gait of Ghost Dubs’ agonizingly slow-motion grooves. Where Ghost Dubs stands out is in the intensity of his productions. Lots of people have tried their hand at this tradition, but few have achieved the heaviness, or the strangeness, of Ghost Dubs’ best work. In “The Regulator,” a dogged 4/4 behemoth, the chords sound like something dredged up out of the murk. In “Dub Lobotomy,” a metallic loop of tone has been completely severed from its origins; the track’s maze-like acoustics suggest slamming doors, footsteps on cement, heavy objects being dragged downstairs. Vocals, when they appear, are no more than disembodied sighs. Some of the most captivating tracks are the most disorienting: “Second Thoughts” is little more than a fistful of coppery chords held up against a backdrop of substation hum, the kick drum stumbling and irregular, the form barely even recognizable as dub. Not everything here is as memorable; in a genre like ambient dub, where there are few chords at the producer’s disposal, it all comes down to the novelty of the detailing. Over the course of the album’s 48-minute run, tracks invariably blur together. But given the hypnotic aspect of Ghost Dubs’ sound, I suspect that’s partly the point. And in any case, every so often a chord rings out in a way that sounds completely new. For me, it happened with “Dub Simulation,” the album’s penultimate track; outwardly, it barely differs from its companions, yet there’s something about the chord’s heft and proportions, at once pillowy and leaden, that immediately stood out. On tracks like that one, Ghost Dubs’ project feels like a formal experiment and a philosophical argument. The popular imagination frequently conflates reggae with sunshine and repose—prelapsarian idyll as stoned fantasy. But what if it were really the soundtrack to darkness, struggle, and enervation? That’s the sound of Damaged, channeling the friction between sensuous pleasure and strenuous physical effort into a virtual boulder of a sound—massive, smooth to the touch, and stubbornly unyielding.",0,"July 24, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ghost-dubs-damaged/
DIIV,Frog in Boiling Water,7.5,Rock,"It’s been five years since DIIV’s last album—clearly, there has been some lingering tension. To set the table: After lead singer Zachary Cole Smith was arrested in 2013 for heroin possession preempting his first trip to rehab and DIIV’s former bassist Devin Ruben Perez was kicked out of the band for making racist comments on 4chan, DIIV “essentially broke up” in 2016. Then, after another stint in rehab, Smith and the band pulled it together for their last album, 2019’s Deceiver, but by this point, frustration was embedded in their dynamic. Press materials are pointedly vague about how the band worked through “suspicions and resentments” before completing Frog in Boiling Water, their sour new album coping with capitalism. Its chiffon layers of reverb wrap around the guitars like a burial cloth, and Smith accepts the boat ride down to purgatory in distant vocals. “Will you please leave me alone,” he implores on “Reflected,” floating through lost souls with self-possession. He’s gotten used to the dark. Other DIIV albums are more concerned with inward darkness, the addiction and depression that dot the band’s history. But Frog acknowledges that these illnesses feed off of and into an already miserable society. “Systems fail and empires fall,” Smith shrugs under raindrops of guitar on “Fender on the Freeway,” sounding jaded and overstimulated. While Frog's vocal melodies are often simple, with nursery-rhyme lightness, tuning into their lyrics make them seem more like sugar-coated pills. They establish Smith as both an objector of the failing system and another one of its many idle subjects, free-floating in the rush of disappointment. The weightless “Frog In Boiling Water” blames technology for this half-hearted complacency, smothering disappointment in reverb the way some people replace unpleasant sensations with posting online. Leading up to Frog’s release, DIIV published an unhinged, endless scroll, Web 1.0 site called soul-net.co. Its content informs visitors that “we are all greasing [the capitalist machine] with our blood and sweat.” Under this text, a naked fairy GIF waggles blue wings, a list combines “the smokestacks, the camps, the landfills, the DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES,” and there’s a PNG of John Hancock’s signature. It goes on and on like this, like the ramblings of a computer-savvy serial killer in the ’90s. The site also has a song on autoplay, “Soul-net,” which appears on Frog as the mirage of a star, a glimmer of irony: “I’m not afraid,” Smith affirms, “I love my pain.” You could glean some of the band’s anxious hysteria out of this. They revel in images and ideas usually associated with suspicious Facebook grandmas worried about “seed oils.” Like an anonymous account might say alongside an image of lizard Joe Biden, Smith is disturbed by how “the rotating villains profit off suffering.” He sneers at a good citizen’s purpose, to be “fodder for the army op.” But he also sings with soft insistence, and his restraint is convincing. Everyone has a good reason to feel as fractured as Frog sounds. Its guitar-led production makes sense of the stress by dumping it into pressure-cooker whining. Though, more often, the guitars would rather loaf in the mud. The band takes pleasure in simple melodies with muscle, like on the melancholy “In Amber.” There, the rhythm guitar bounces like a nervous leg until the lead guitar wrests the song open. DIIV repeatedly employ this tactic throughout the album, presenting each song like a cold tomb to be set on fire, typically, by a one-note guitar solo you can feel drilling into your stomach. It’s thrilling. “Little Birds” is like a dry lightning field, empty aside from the occasional crackle of distortion. But its lead guitar always returns to the same note, filling the space with an insistent echo. These repetitive moments come on like a ticking clock, and Frog in Boiling Water operates with a prophetic understanding that time has already run out.

Foxing,Foxing,7.8,Rock,"Failure is the secret of Foxing’s success. The St. Louis band’s most popular songs to date are either about romantic rejection or religious trauma, or the indignity of having to relive those indignities onstage, or the financial precarity that comes with reliving those indignities onstage instead of, I dunno, getting a desk job with health benefits. Before the release of 2021’s Draw Down the Moon, drummer Jon Hellwig joked that Foxing might have been better off if the album flopped, giving them an excuse to opt out of emo-indie cult stardom and start playing nu-metal. That didn’t exactly happen, but they made their “Break Stuff” anyway. “Carson MTV! Bizkit NYE! Fuck! Fuck! Fuuuck!” guitarist Eric Hudson shrieks on the priceless chorus of “Hell 99,” a stadium-sized skramz spasm that is arguably the most aggro and the most catchy Foxing song yet, and undeniably the first that sounds like they’re having fun. After a decade shooting for the stars, Foxing is the sound of a band liberated by wallowing in the mud. By swapping the sounds of Coachella 2012 for Woodstock ’99, “Hell 99” might appear as a course correction for Draw Down the Moon, an album that couldn’t totally beat the Grouplove allegations but had fathoms of dread beneath its Day-Glo exterior. Singer Conor Murphy means to be taken at face value when he blares, “Throw out all the joy and show me metrics for my failures.” But the only major difference between the subject matter of Foxing and its predecessor is that the latter lacked any songs about his dog dying. This album counts at least two. Think of Foxing as Nearer My God’s evil genius twin: the type that spends more time in detention than study hall and still ends up with an A. Where in the past the band’s experimentalism was anchored by clean, rafter-reaching choruses, Foxing genre-leaps without a net, trusting its weirdest impulses to embellish and deliver the hooks. No spoilers for opener “Secret History”: Just know that by comparison, “Hell 99” is kind of a breather, at least before a refrain of “Constant shame! Constant fatigue!” hyperventilates into an ambient collapse. “Gratitude” is the one Obama-core throwback, performed with a white-knuckled intensity equal to the parts of Foxing that might credibly be compared to Deafheaven, Knocked Loose, and, in the case of “Dead Internet,” a Soundgarden mp3 playing through a dial-up modem. For 56 minutes Foxing alternately thrills and confounds but provides little in the way of catharsis. No longer daydreaming of planetary apocalypse, Foxing fears not death but dying, the Doomsday Clock that starts up with every morning alarm. The mantras provide grounding and no relief—“You’re on your own”; “Repeat and then repeat, you can never really leave”; “What if it doesn’t matter anymore?” On “Kentucky McDonald’s” the vocal, lead, and rhythm guitar melodies appear to be going in opposite directions, as if drawn and quartered by Nearer My God’s four horsemen. The arrangement turns molten as Murphy sounds like he’s choking on his own blood, but there’s no release, only more tension. Questioning your entire life on a Ronald McDonald bench is not something that should be resolved in four minutes. Murphy likens the Foxing experience to a slow drowning on “Greyhound,” which thrashes to the surface only for him to yell, “It means nothing to me!” If only. In an interview, Foxing revealed how much they despised each other during the album’s recording, how Hudson spent five days “hate-mixing” a song that he couldn’t wrap his head around and experienced “the darkest fucking thoughts of my life” revisiting The Albatross for adoring crowds in 2023. They don’t give a firm answer as to whether it was all worth it. Foxing concludes with a recording of Hudson at 13, saying to Murphy, “I don’t think the song is as good as it could be, but it’s coming along.” If they could have seen 20 years ahead, would they keep at it? As Murphy sighs during the preceding piano ballad “Cry Baby,” “If I could I’d start over again/It’s been fun but I’d change everything.” Foxing isn’t a sob story from a band that is, objectively, more successful than most of its peers. Save for a few snapshots from the road, Murphy’s words could be those of a middle school teacher buying their own supplies for the next term, a harried public defender $250,000 in debt, or basically anyone exploited by their idealism long enough to realize salvation isn’t coming. If there were a viral hit or festival booking that could make Foxing feel secure, it probably won’t come from this album. Instead, the meaning comes from the dozens of little moments when they’ve pushed themselves further than they imagined, without promise of any future reward. The days of yelling “I want it all” to an imagined arena audience are gone. Foxing are learning to want what they have. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Ashanti,Ashanti,7.2,Pop/R&B,"By the early 2000s, every rapper, producer, and label with a weekly Billboard subscription had a new formula for a Top 40 hit: Get a rapper and a singer together to make a song for women. Murder, Inc. arguably had the slickest cheat code, pairing the label’s flagship artist Ja Rule’s surly love-laden raps with a sweet R&B voice like Christina Milian or a soulful gospel tone like Lil’ Mo. Around this time, a 19-year-old Ashanti met Murder, Inc.’s excitable co-founder, Irv Gotti, who, back then, didn’t want an upstart singer from suburban Glen Cove, Long Island, on his hardcore rap label. Instead, he enlisted her as an in-house songwriter and guest vocalist. Despite what Gotti told her in their initial meeting—that he wasn’t “an R&B dude”—he kinda was. His breadwinner, Ja, was a cosplaying 2Pac moonlighting as millennial rap’s Keith Sweat. His new secret weapon was an affable former high school track star who softened Ja’s aggressive balladeering. Ashanti spent her early Murder, Inc. days writing for her life at Crack House Studios in Manhattan’s SoHo, surrounded by dice-rolling men—the little sister among “a den of wolves,” as Gotti described. She was the sweetie in a room full of so-called gangsters. Her voice wasn’t all that soulful or acrobatic. It was featherweight and more coy than cool, never at risk of overshadowing a song’s lead, which made her the perfect companion for rappers aiming to create sticky street anthems. Millennial pop soon alternated between two distinct sounds: Ja Rule’s freaky outbursts and Ashanti’s gentle coos. She got her big break singing the hook on Big Pun’s posthumous 2001 single, “How We Roll.” From there, it was a full-on blitz. She sang background vocals on Ja’s monster Jennifer Lopez duet “I’m Real,” a summery jam built on a sample from Rick James’ 1978 weed ode “Mary Jane.” She backed Fat Joe’s crowing serenades on “What’s Luv.” Ja Rule plucked Ashanti again for his sophomore album’s second single, “Always on Time.” His semi-mushy, gaslight-ridden version of romance opens with Ashanti’s soft vocals setting up a toxic love story, complementing Ja’s bearish declarations about swinging dick and running on belated Jesus time. The song peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and set Murder Inc.’s low-key young hitmaker up for a smooth transition from utility player to solo star. The charts might’ve belonged to Ja, but he was no Ashanti. By the time Ashanti’s self-titled debut dropped in April 2002, she was already a household name. The combination of her breakthrough solo single, “Foolish,” hitting No. 1 for 10 weeks, and “What’s Luv” at No. 2 made her the first woman to simultaneously occupy the top two spots on the Billboard Hot 100. The pop landscape was eager for a voice as sleek as Aaliyah’s after her death, and Ashanti thrived in the mid-tempo zone. Sometimes, too mid. Shortly after her debut dropped, over 20,000 people signed an online petition against her winning Soul Train’s Lady of Soul Award, citing her lack of “singing ability and stage presence.” Her vocals weren’t striking enough to blow out stadiums, but with no major rivals in her path and Beyoncé’s solo debut still a year off, Ashanti sat comfortably on her perch as America’s sweetheart. Contemporary R&B was full of lush spins on the genre—an amalgam of classic soul from the likes of Angie Stone, Alicia Keys, and Raphael Saadiq; the boyish radio-ready charm of artists like Usher and Mario; and forward-thinking singers like Kelis, Amerie, and Truth Hurts. By May 2002, hip-hop and R&B collaborations made up about a fifth of the top 50 songs on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. Half of those records featured Ja, Ashanti, or both. It’s not a stretch to say Murder Inc.’s success likely influenced the Recording Academy’s creation of a new Rap/Sung category that year, later renamed Best Melodic Rap—Ja’s Case-assisted single “Living It Up” lost the inaugural award to Eve and Gwen Stefani’s “Let Me Blow Ya Mind.” Jay-Z and R. Kelly’s platinum-selling joint album, Best of Both Worlds, released earlier that year, further crystallized the trend. Gotti prematurely dubbed Ashanti the Princess of Hip-Hop and R&B, positioning her as a successor to Mary J. Blige. But of course, the princess title was rooted in binary thinking. “Irv was like, ‘This is our princess. She’s not our bitch and ho. She’s our princess,’” Fat Joe recalled in 2003. Though Ashanti herself aspired to blend rhythm and blues with tough hip-hop beats like Blige, the blues part is much more subdued on Ashanti’s debut, which focuses more on surface melodrama and soft, curling melodies than a deep exploration of personal trauma. Her songs touch on darker aspects of relationships while still playing it safe stylistically—not as gorgeously raw and somber as an album like My Life but looking to capture a similar melancholy. Ashanti’s solo album was released just two months before the premiere of American Idol, the singing competition show that could catapult new talent onto the pop charts. Her origin story would’ve fit right in with the heartwarming packaging of Idol contestants: a suburban Black girl whose father was a singer and whose mother, a former dance teacher, discovered her singing Blige’s “Reminisce” while vacuuming and thought it was a voice on the radio. By age 6, Ashanti was singing in church and local talent shows. At 14, she got her first record deal with Jive in 1994, but when the label tried to steer her toward pop, she rebuffed. She passed up Princeton and Hampton University scholarships to continue chasing her dreams and moved to Atlanta for a second deal with Epic’s subsidiary, Noontime. Label shake-ups again left her shelved and back in New York, where she had the fortuitous meeting with Irv Gotti that landed her at Murder, Inc. Ashanti saw those formative setbacks as preparation for the boot camp that was Murder, Inc., where Gotti would have his artists battle each other for beats and recognition, like a rap version of ROTC. Whoever wrote the hottest lyrics got to claim the beat. At one point, Ashanti recorded a reference track for Jennifer Lopez’s “I’m Real” remix, written by Ja. (In an epically petty move, Sony Music’s head, Tommy Mottola, had apparently tasked Gotti with crafting a hit song for J. Lo to keep Mottola’s ex-wife, Mariah Carey, from the No. 1 spot.) Unbeknownst to Ashanti, Gotti kept her background vocals in the song’s final mix, fueling the infamous myth that Lopez had tried to pass Ashanti’s voice off as her own. Ashanti co-wrote another J. Lo record, “Ain’t It Funny (Remix)” and lobbied to keep the song for herself. She could’ve been stuck stunting as a cameo queen while her work helped legitimize J. Lo’s “Jenny from the Block” persona, but those records quietly set the stage for Ashanti’s string of hits. Still, it wasn’t until Ashanti delivered another chart-topper that Gotti fully committed to signing her to Murder, Inc. Her breakthrough solo single, “Foolish,” was a soap opera without a plot, an engrossing tale of self-destruction about craving the comfort of a bad relationship. Gotti effectively took the HOV lane to the top of the charts, using a loop from producer 7 Aurelius that was originally created for Brandy and featured the same DeBarge sample as the Notorious B.I.G.’s hit “One More Chance.” While this fusion of old and new sounds effortless on “Foolish,” the execution is clunky throughout Ashanti’s debut. Her intro blends snippets of her star collabs into an EPK-like medley with a screwed male voice announcing, “And now, for our featured presentation…” Despite their sometimes captivating sense of ease and simplicity, the album cuts never quite match the pomp and circumstance of her debut single. “Foolish” bleeds into its counterpart, “Happy,” a sparse, sunlit ode to Ashanti discovering the love she’d been searching for all her teenage life, with airy flutes that sound like she’s kicking her feet up on a swing. On “Leaving (Always On Time Part II),” the sequel to her and Ja’s breakout hit, he reprises his role as the cheating lover attempting reconciliation. “Call” finds Ashanti rephrasing the sentiment a third time: “When you call, I’ll be right there,” a clumsy attempt to squeeze the last bit of juice from a single idea. Gotti’s blatant attempt to brand Ashanti as Blige’s heir apparent plagues tracks like “Scared” and “Rescue.” The former is a gloomy groove where his voice lurks in the background like a devil on the shoulder while Ashanti debates letting go of a tumultuous relationship. The latter track repurposes the creeping keys from “Leaving” into a gloomy plea for escape. Gotti reappears as a bruised ex in a subsequent skit, leading into the moody breakup record “Over,” which follows all the back-and-forth contemplations from the previous songs to its logical conclusion. On “Baby,” Ashanti drops her voice to a compelling lower register, a yearning tone that cuts through the album’s vague narratives. Gotti shamelessly ripped the exact rhythm and “Mary, Mary, Mary…” melody from Scarface’s 1997 single “Mary Jane,” laced over producers 7 Aurelius and Chink Santana’s keys to create an operatic ballad about being sucked into a love jones. In recalling his own ingenious move in BET’s 2022 Murder Inc. documentary, Gotti says with a smirk: “Not only did we take the beat, I had Ashanti take Scarface’s flow.” The back-end sequel “Unfoolish” picks at the same scab as “Foolish” but with a dusted-off Biggie verse from “Fucking You Tonight.” The song was meant as a promotional single to assuage listeners. On the album, it’s used as a narrative full-circle moment to show Ashanti’s growth: “Proud to say I will never make the same mistake,” she sings. On the sentimental follow-up, “Dreams,” Ashanti sings, “Dreams are real/All you have to do is just believe.” Such was her style—a little bit cheesy, a little bit sweet. Of course, a raging bull named 50 Cent soon ran Ja Rule off the charts and the streets, effectively ending the Murder Inc. dynasty. A federal indictment accelerated the label’s collapse. Still, Gotti retained control of Ashanti’s masters up until two years ago when she announced she was re-recording her debut to reclaim ownership of the album and break free from Gotti’s control. Only recently have they both addressed their once-rumored romantic relationship, though Ashanti avoided defining it as such. She told Angie Martinez in 2023, “Manipulation played a heavy part in me and Irv’s situation.” Gotti, meanwhile, came across as a power player who got so emotionally involved with one of his artists that his other signees, Charli Baltimore and Vita, felt neglected on the roster. While Gotti claimed he conceived “Happy” during a post-coital shower, Ashanti later clarified that she wrote the song in a Long Island parking lot. Gotti’s heavy hand is the main reason Ashanti’s debut feels programmed into oblivion. But despite its predictability, the album has a certain sonic purity that marks a shift in both sound and thinking for the industry at large. The rise of hip-hop and R&B collabs seemed like the natural order of the universe, an inevitable merger of two rapidly commercializing music genres carrying the New Jack Swing era’s momentum. Rappers today who might’ve once needed a soul singer to sweeten their sixteens can belt their own hooks. SZA has credited Ashanti’s minimalist style as a key influence on her own fluid sound. The genres are now cosmically intertwined. But for better and worse, Ashanti’s debut solidified an algorithm that’s since reached a point of singularity.",0,"July 21, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ashanti-ashanti/
Tim Koh,Salt and Sugar Look the Same,7.4,Electronic,"When the multi-instrumentalist and visual artist Tim Koh was three or four years old, Elvis Presley’s 1973 concert from Hawaii played regularly on the family’s newly acquired color television. “I had a fuzzy, round pillow that I’d stand on as a stage and pretend to perform [on],” he told the Talkhouse. Eventually, he found actual stages to play on and spent some two decades working with fellow travelers including Animal Collective, Hieroglyphic Being, DJ Harvey, and No Age. Now based in Berlin, Koh recently began a kind of email-based game of exquisite corpse with L.A.-based graphic and sound designer Sun An, who’d been releasing his own music for over a decade. Salt and Sugar Look the Same unfolds the results of their back-and-forth across some 18 miniatures that sound like half-overheard conversations only half-remembered. Sine waves ripple and snap; warm whooshes of melody float tropically in the mist; voices sing at uncanny speeds. All this is nothing exactly new—deja vu put to disc has a legacy going back at least to Erik Satie, passing through the eternal Éliane Radigue hum and still unparalleled otherworldliness of early Boards of Canada records. But part of the point of this kind of communication is the generous recognition of the familiar. Friendship sprouts from common ground. Opener “Bye Bye Betty” sends a voice message, made mechanically variable in pitch and speed, over wires of acoustic guitars; by “Besafe Airtel,” the wires tangle into brambles. Tracks like “Old Plates and Desirable Traits” and “Drawing to Relax and Pass the Time” build little worlds of acoustic and electric sources, the former with a bit of new-wave froideur and the latter so warm and wet you could get bitten by all the little buzzing things flying around. It’s a rare bit of muchness on an otherwise restrained record: “The Maybes Are Endless” distills everything to two chords strummed on an electric guitar, a rocking chair blues. There are also synesthetic aims. “Yume-No-Yume” curls in the air like its namesake incense, often a combination of plum and cherry blossoms and lavender designed to help the sniffer remember dreams. “Incense Holder,” with its glinting glitches, also plays as it’s named, a faceted structure to hold ineffable sound. And the golden plumes of “Lemongrass Citronella” are powerful enough to keep those biters at bay. It’s not all bliss, though. “Today Only Happens Once” approaches a kind of industrial unease that seems equally nostalgic for Throbbing Gristle and the occult grooviness of Scooby Doo soundtracks. Some tracks plank—the drone of “Somewhere in Time,” for example, suspends itself with rickety strength and the echo of sweat—and others, like “Twice” ache like the memory of exertion. A high-pitched whistle cuts through foggy closer “Expected to Fade” like a tea kettle—time to wake up—before a thick blanket of hiss drags you under. This is music more for giving in than letting go. Across these 38 minutes, Koh and An are talking to each other, talking to themselves, and listening in. I heard ghosts from my own past and saw projections of what I imagine their lives might be, to the point where I felt like I could draw my own notes into the folds. Contained within are noises of pleasure and of pain; of wrapping an arm around the warm shoulder of a lover and letting go of a friend hypnotized by their rage; of stoned teenage pals and hallucinating adult companions and the comedown of middle age; and, above all, the curious grief of childhood, when being a kid seems to only mean finding out how big the world is and how little say you have in it. For me, it’s all in “Can’t Stand in the Past,” which shifts unsteadily on drums so epically slowed that their skins become fuzzy, round pillows, little islands, miniature ersatz stages for us to perform our own remembering and becoming.",0,"June 24, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tim-koh-sun-an-salt-and-sugar-look-the-same/
SUSS,Birds & Beasts,7.8,Experimental,"SUSS evoke the blistering days and chilly nights of an American desert. Their take on “ambient country,” a term they apparently coined, is elegant, luxurious, and teeming with technology—less like actually living in the Mojave than watching a time-lapse of the sky dappling its mesas and buttes. The New York trio leans hard into these imagined environs: A 2022 self-titled album featured songs titled “Gallup, NM” and “Needles, CA,” communities along Route 66 that the group’s members knew mostly from the vantage of the tour van. If the cowboy shtick sounds like cosplay, it disguises an equally prominent Downtown sensibility: SUSS, once a quartet with synth wizard Gary Leib before his unexpected death in 2021, weave their sound with a legacy of improvisation that has as much to do with the genre experiments of the Kitchen and the ’90s Knitting Factory as, say, the Grand Ole Opry. The potentially straw-thin gimmickry of “ambient country” is a vessel for urban yearnings, daydreams of pastoral life conjured up in the confinement of the metropolis. It helps that the band, which now comprises pedal steel player Jonathan Gregg and multi-instrumentalists Bob Holmes and Pat Irwin (onetime guitarist for the B-52’s), emerged during the final years of the last decade, both an efflorescent period for ambient music and a moment when country was becoming more palatable to a wider variety of listeners. SUSS highlight a big-sky sweep that informed the former genre throughout its history: Pedal steel set a tone on Brian Eno’s scene-defining 1983 record Apollo, resurfaced on the KLF’s 1990 game-changer Chill Out, and took centerstage on Bruce Kaphan’s underknown 2001 record Slider, a focal point for the seemingly walleyed convergence of new age and Americana. SUSS’s 2018 debut, Ghost Box, may not have forged an original style, but it drew a bright red circle around ambient aesthetics that had always hidden in plain sight. Sometimes, putting a name to the unnameable is what innovation is all about. Their new album, Birds & Beasts, takes the time-lapse metaphor to its extreme. The record seems to deal in eons, in the slow progression of ecology—the movements of fauna and the death and rebirth of flora. One can feel millennia pass in this record. The songs are wordless, aside from some muffled speech samples, so the only clues to their themes are SUSS’ highly suggestive song titles—“Migration,” for example, or “Overstory,” which brings to mind a verdant, thick canopy in a part of the world that has since become dusty and arid. (Not to mention novelist Richard Powers’ 2018 lament for the death of trees.) Many of the tunes are based around sighing keys, piano, and pedal steel, but “Restless” and “Flight” forefront finger-picked guitar rhythms, the sound of a small animal scurrying across a huge landscape. The interplay between wide, somber space and the staccato optimism of enduring life makes for the most thoughtfully structured record of SUSS’s career. Birds & Beasts doesn’t necessarily surprise, but it crystallizes this band’s essence, particularly as they find their footing after the shocking loss of Leib. These seven tracks are full of delicate balances, so immaculately produced that supple details assume their own life—the way that the guitar melody barely floats on the surface of “Restless,” for example, or how Gregg’s pedal steel seems to shift its direction in the middle of the song, as though the band just reversed the current of a river. The only cut to feature their late bandmate is “Migration,” which has kicked around in the SUSS songbook for years before ending up as this album’s closer. The most maximal composition in an understated set, “Migration”—like “Restless” and “Flight”—is sewn by thin stitches of guitar, diaphanous parts that keep this patchwork whole. Meanwhile, Holmes’ harmonica offers a sense of yearning, a train whistle heard in a one-horse town. Such connotations bring with them all of the postmodern weight and irony accrued since America developed a vocabulary for describing the culture (one-horse!) of its sprawling heartland. Ditto the song’s buried vocal loops, most of them inaudible, although we can hear a male voice say, “Finally, they believed that they had the answers,” a self-serious exclamation that fizzles out like a distant radio signal. We begin the album with an image of the migratory patterns of the titular birds and beasts, and end thinking about humanity as it zooms forth so quickly that the world-expanding achievements of yesteryear become quaint, bits of modern archaeology familiar enough that they have become part of our species’ natural habitat. SUSS revel in slippery distinctions between the manmade and the organic, the way that a synthesizer can sound indistinguishable from an acoustic instrument in the right hands. Their latest, though, puts human achievement in context—our entire civilization, this searching, glacial music seems to tell us, is merely a blip at the tail end of a slow evolution. Or, in other words: Birds & Beasts offers the revelation of a cross-country road trip, when the towns fall away and the land becomes grander, when people begin to feel as small as they actually are.

Peso Pluma,ÉXODO,6.9,Folk/Country,"Let’s start with the Edgar mullet: the haircut that has kids all across Mexico walking into barbershops and demanding the “Peso Pluma.” This is just one of the idiosyncrasies that has made Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija the man of the moment in mainstream Spanish-language music. There is the expensive jewelry and designer clothing—Richard Mille watches, Christian Dior shoes, Maison Margiela jackets—that he regularly namechecks in his songs. There is his lanky physique. And then there is his voice: a scratchy, sometimes grating croak or rasp, depending on his mood. That singular voice sings about lots of things: popping bottles of Dom, carrying bricks of coke, assassinating enemies, hooking up with Russian models. You know, an average Tuesday. Over the last year, the 25-year-old Mexican singer of Lebanese descent has racked up a list of chart and streaming records as long as a CVS receipt, ushering música mexicana to unprecedented commercial heights. ÉXODO, his fourth studio album, is a victory lap of sorts; the LP celebrates how far the movement has come, with Pluma taking homies, cousins, and fellow trailblazers like Natanael Cano, Junior H, Tito Double P, and Eslabon Armado along for the ride. But the album is also a bona fide attempt to cement Peso Pluma’s versatility—and the longevity it promises—in the industry. ÉXODO confirms he’s one of the most charismatic corrido performers of our time, but as for his ability to shapeshift across genres and flows, Peso Pluma the pop star still has some convincing to do. The crackle of Peso’s voice is the molten core of ÉXODO. Its peculiarity is a blessing, but in some moments, it can also be a curse. His coarse growl is especially effective on the bare-knuckle norteño “La People II,” which seems to be written from the perspective of Joel Enrique “El 19” Sandoval Romero, a sicario and security chief for the Sinaloa cartel who was arrested by the Mexican government in 2014. Pluma and his guests snarl viciously as they recount tales of battling police officers, the national guard, and the military to protect their bosses (ostensibly Ovidio Guzmán López, a high-ranking leader of the Sinaloa cartel and the son of El Chapo) from capture. Peso assumes the voice of El 19, asking his associates to take care of his “land, his family, and his parents,” presumably while he’s locked up. The debate about artists’ roles in glamorizing narco culture didn’t start with—and won’t end with—Peso Pluma. Too often, narcocorrido stars have become ideological scapegoats for the federal government’s failure to curb violence; other times, artists have denied they have any sociocultural impact at all. The discourse is fraught, but one thing is certain: Pluma excels when he performs the mythos of narco culture, no holds barred. It places him firmly within the genealogy of his forebears, like his late idols Chalino Sánchez and Ariel Camacho, who showed a similar talent for passionate storytelling, even as they romanticized narratives of murder and revenge. La Doble P reimagines that tradition on “Put Em in the Fridge,” a cold corrido-trap beat built on a blaring horn loop. He tries on a squeaky but bellicose cadence for size, bragging with Cardi B about moving kilos and calling on shooters to put their enemies on ice. Cardi’s gift for rapping athletically in both Dominican Spanish and English makes her a natural collaborator here; the pair goes bar for bar in a thrilling, peacocking display. It’s also a sublime example of Pluma’s talent for redefining his musical heritage for the present day. Sometimes, Peso’s vocal left turns are electrifying; other times, he struggles to hit the mark. On the eminently catchy “Bruce Wayne,” he likens himself to the superhero billionaire with gravelly self-assurance, only to switch into biting, Pusha T-style raps two minutes in. On “Me Activo,” he shifts his voice into a serenade-like tone reminiscent of his performance on Kali Uchis’ “Igual Que un Ángel.” But elsewhere, the elasticity of Peso’s voice is less convincing. Despite a superb Ric Flair sample, the ballad “Ice” suffers from the more abrasive, nasally textures of Peso’s voice when he strains to reach a higher register. It’s particularly tough to hear La Doble P struggle in his ventures outside of corridos tumbados. That’s not to say he isn’t capable of adapting successfully. Take the single “Bellakeo,” a sexy reggaeton entanglement with a drilling dembow riddim that contains spiritual echoes of Plan B. But ÉXODO is littered with unfortunate miscalculations. “Gimme a Second,” with Rich the Kid, feels like a throwaway B-side from the already middling Future and Metro Boomin album; Pluma’s appearance starts off strong with a low, sinister bridge, but then he forcefully tries to squeeze his squeaky voice into one of Atlanta’s distinctive flows. “Pa No Pensar,” an emo trap ballad with corrido undertones, boasts a grippingly morose vocal performance, but it’s marred by cookie-cutter lines about overindulging in alcohol and weed to escape reality (I’ll stay for Quavo saying “This good mota,” though). And, “Peso Completo,” with the reggaeton legend Arcángel, falls into the trap of pure mimesis. Though the artists share a trademark rasp, one of Arcángel’s creative tics is artful over-enunciation; Pluma straight up apes that technique here, resulting in a poorly executed facsimile. The idea of flaunting his versatility is admirable. But that message might have been more efficiently conveyed if ÉXODO didn’t frequently feel like a slog. The first eight tracks are nearly indistinguishable, coalescing into a lyrical and melodic blur of tololoche strums, money, and women. Even if the album format has been downgraded in the streaming era, ÉXODO works neither as a coherent LP nor as a no-skips playlist. Like many other major pop albums of the 2020s, it would have benefited from a careful edit and a more varied track order. But when Peso Pluma decides to shine, he’s radiant. “Vino Tinto,” with Natanael Cano and Gabito Ballesteros, is a graduate-level seminar in the corrido tumbado form. All three singers push their voices to the limit: They bellow, they growl, and they harmonize, transmitting the yearning and suffering that undergirds the best corridos—even if they are talking about drinking red wine and waiting for the molly to hit, not your local folk hero’s war battles. When Peso belts out “Ando relax,” he elongates and then punctuates the “a,” as if his vibeyness is some supernatural force rising from within. It’s the corrido prince at his most magnetic, capturing all the style’s thorny contradictions in a single breath.",0,"June 24, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/peso-pluma-exodo/
Rapsody,Please Don’t Cry,8.1,Rap,"For years, Rapsody has done the exhausting work of reminding people that Black women aren’t a monolith. On 2019’s Eve, she named each song after a Black woman, using each muse to build out bespoke worlds of sounds and images. The concept subtly applied to Rapsody as well: from a prominent Uncle Luke sample, to a fun refrain about big ole butts, the North Carolina rapper chipped away at the idea that her love of lyricism is antithetical to sexuality and fun. She’d clearly heard the puritan calls to “Listen to Rapsody,” a thing goobers like to say to diminish other female rappers, and felt misrepresented.Please Don’t Cry sets the record straight. Taking a hammer to the idea that she is merely a lyricist or conscious rapper—her own monolith—Rapsody clarifies her identity and the depth of her talent over lush blends of R&B, gospel, reggae, and trap. The record is a vivid affirmation of self and community, and a rap clinic. She sounds unleashed. Rapsody frames the shapeshifting album as a verklempt therapy session with storied actress Phylicia Rashad, who encourages her to let the feelings flow. She obliges, cycling through styles as she reflects on her career and struggles. Please Don’t Cry is clearly a reset. It’s her first album without production from longtime mentor and label head 9th Wonder, and though the record has traces of Jamla Records’ soulful boom-bap, there’s more sheen than dust. Besides Eric G, Rapsody sources the production entirely from outside her label, tapping A-list vets like S1 and Hit-Boy and fresh faces like BLK ODYSSY. She also recruits more singers than fellow rappers, departing from the posse cuts of her past work. The result is an album festooned in tones and melodies, its mix of modern and classic sounds evoking humid Dungeon Family funk, uplifting Miseducation spirituality, and moody TDE medleys. The beats alone relay Rapsody’s raging multiplicity. At 41, Rapsody’s got nothing to prove, but plenty on her mind, and lots of ways to share it. From the opening lines of “Marlanna,” her real name, she’s in constant flux, reintroducing herself as a vocalist and composer as much as a lyricist. “The one they call boring, still boarding/I’m unseen, I’m morphine, I tried to ease your pain/Now I’m morphing, some never change, I had to,” she raps, her pitch rising with each line. “DND (It’s Not Personal)” flips Monica’s “Don’t Take It Personal” into a balmy G-funk ode to solitude. Rapsody’s voice swings between peeved and pianissimo as she details her perfect day alone, building to a clever “Juicy” interpolation that somehow also has shades of 2Pac: “Me days are the best days/Days like these days, I’m on the beach sippin’ lychee,” Rapsody sings. Impressively, the music never strains under all these currents. It is sumptuous and referential without feeling cluttered. The tidal flows and layered writing aren’t just for show. Like Denzel Curry on Melt My Eyez and Kendrick on Mr. Morale, Rapsody has been going through some things, and her expanded toolkit of vocal tics lets her express her shifting emotions. She’s conflicted on the watery “Look What You’ve Done,” thankful for the way the Grammy nomination for Laila’s Wisdom gave her career a second wind, but irked by backhanded compliments. “Don’t lift me up throwing shade at my sistas that made it out with ass and bass/Support what you like, you ain’t gotta show love using hate,” she snaps. She details her own sexual experiences on the reflective “That One Time” and steamy “3:AM,” examining doomed relationships with women that nonetheless fortified her sense of self. “You my lesson, blessin,” a sultry Erykah Badu sings on the hook, capturing the spirit of grateful heartbreak. On “Loose Rocks,” an elegiac track about dementia eroding a loved one’s memory, Rapsody sounds on the verge of tears, her impassioned verses garlanded with cool melodies from Alex Isley. The fluid vocals enhance her lyricism, allowing her to emphasize the feeling of words as much as their meaning. That doesn’t mean there’s not still plenty of her signature wordplay. Amid the soul-searching of reggae-tinged “Never Enough,” she breezes through the Fugees’ discography: “Blunted on reality like Wiz Khalifa/Like a nappy head through all my logic, theories, and my thesis/Add pussy to it so it reach ’em.” The spacey “Asteroids” finds her “out the window like the Joker in the foreign,” while the triumphant “Back In My Bag,” which flips the Afrobeat song “Love and Death” into booming trap, has her bouncing on niggas like Sanaa Lathan in Love & Basketball. Amid the gushing and weeping, she is playful and sly. She’s having the time of her life. In fact, this spectrum of emotions is her life.By the end, Please Don’t Cry is as much a flex as it is a clarification. Lyricist is just one of Rapsody’s titles, and she relishes the chance to show all the flows, cadences, and deliveries she’s mastered. She’s no saint, cudgel, or fantasy. She’s not even an apologist for pussy rap, which she says bores her on “Diary of a Mad Bitch.” She’s just herself, a veteran b-girl who found her voice and kept evolving. Watch her work.

454,Casts of a Dreamer,8.0,Rap,"It’s true: The Mario Kart Super Star power-up, long limited to 10 fleeting seconds of candy-colored acceleration, has been lawfully extended to an hour, and we have 454, a Florida-born rapper who imports gushy pluggnb from extraplanetary locations—Rainbow Road, authorities suspect—to thank. His latest tape, Casts of a Dreamer, which dropped on his SoundCloud last week, could just as well be peddled from the backseat of a sun-kissed convertible. There’s a top-down air to it, the fuck-it frenzy of a joyride experienced on copious amounts of caffeine, work and school teeny specks in the rearview. Considering its mastermind, a longtime denizen of the space between cloud rap and scorching psychedelia, it isn’t so much a surprise as a refresher—this isn’t 454’s first open-road epic, nor has he taken his foot off the gas since the last one. But damn does terminal velocity (still) feel good. Throw this on your vehicle’s Bluetooth system and watch the “Missed call: Boss (15)” notifications pile up. As a skateboard-clutching high schooler, 454 spent his screentime with one eye on Baker movies and the other on FL Studio tutorials. In similar fashion to Fast Trax 3, his breakneck 2022 opus, Casts of a Dreamer first surfaced as a single, hour-long track. Not all of it cracks the 100 BPM mark, though its helium-stuffed samples and skittery drum chops are indicative of a Floridian lineage. Even 454’s most downtempo songs feel like skid marks smoldering on smoking pavement. Take “Moving to Fast,” a glistening slow-burn in which he apologizes for, well, moving too fast. His cadence hilariously calls its own bluff: He’s on his knees, looking up at this unnamed love interest, gurgling like a child choking on snotty tears. Girl, I thought I was just moving too fast! Girl, I thought we was just moving too fast! He’s still moving pretty fast, which is the endearing part: He can’t entirely smash the brakes on his spirit, but he loves his craft deeply enough to try. Even his failure sounds like a cathartic overflow. 454 tries on a number of hats on Casts of a Dreamer, which doesn’t scan as a fully conceptualized project so much as a free-spirited idea dump. It’s a joyride, after all, and far more infatuated with the thrill of movement than the finality of arrival. Seasoned as he may be, 454 still approaches production—his first musical love, long before he started spitting up-pitched soliloquies over his own beats—with the bug-eyed holy-shit-ness of a kid holding a brand-new MIDI controller on Christmas morning. This is gleefully evident on tracks like the sample-snitching “TEMS FLIP,” originally released earlier this year as a one-off single. Title notwithstanding, it oozes with the pride of having pulled this off: the Nigerian megastar’s vocal runs, originally cast in a vulnerable Future smash, repurposed for an airy ode to PS2s and instant ramen. You can practically see 454 leaping up from his laptop, overhead headphones proffered in an outstretched palm. Tracking 454’s growth is thrilling not only because of his frenzied pastel music, but maybe even more because of its contagious, let’s-have-fun ardor. The rapper-producer archetype implies a desperate urge to see one’s vision through: No time to wait for placements, one might think, when I have my own story, and my own means of telling it. 454, skater by day and musician by night, seems intent on shirking indie-rap insularity, as if dragging his rig—laptop, speakers, mic, Focusrite, MIDI—out the front door, wires trailing. As he runs off into the sunset, Doppler-effected plugg blaring through his system, the neighbors are probably shaking their heads, smiling. You don’t have to match his high speed to match his high spirits.",0,"October 11, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/454-casts-of-a-dreamer/
Previous Industries,Service Merchandise,7.8,Rap,"One day, you’ll wake up aching for some undefined reason, perhaps a little hungover from the one glass of wine you had with dinner, and solemnly think to yourself, “Fuck, I’m old.” There is new stiffness in your hips from standing too long in less-than-sensible shoes, or driving around town and pointing out that a new business used to be a different one. Aging is weird and often painful, but it’s also fascinating, even hilarious. The years speed up exponentially until months pass in a blink, the time between sunrise and sunset shrinking down to nothing. Open Mike Eagle, Video Dave, and STILL RIFT feel the passage of time in their bones. The Los Angeles via Chicago emcees who make up the new trio Previous Industries named their debut after a retail catalog that went bankrupt in 1999. Thumbing through it provided a specific kind of dopamine rush now lost to the ages. References to it abound throughout Service Merchandise—“I would not feel sad at all/If I could buy everything in the catalog,” sings Video Dave during the chorus of “Roebuck.” Most of the songs bear the name of a store you’d see in every mall in the United States before they became sad ghost towns, air conditioning and smooth jazz blasting in the emptied, echoing caverns of capitalism. But this isn’t just an album about how Gen Xers and elder millennials get misty-eyed when they think about Blockbuster. The trio uses nostalgia as a tool of examination, ruminating on the not-too-distant past in order to process the funny and sometimes heartbreaking process of getting older together. The three rappers have such effortless chemistry that it’s hard to believe that Service Merchandise is their first group outing. They’ve been in each other’s orbit for a lifetime: Eagle and RIFT (originally Rift Napalm) met at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, forming the group PDX with fellow Chicago rapper Psalm One, which eventually absorbed into the legendary Nacrobats crew. Video Dave and Eagle first met in college at Southern Illinois University, forging a friendship and artistic bond that led to many collaborations and tours together (including work on Eagle’s TV series The New Negroes). During the pandemic lockdown, the three would gather at Eagle’s apartment for whiskey-fueled gaming and recording sessions, eventually compiling what would become Service Merchandise. The album doesn’t stray too far from the hazy, inviting sound Eagle has mined for his last couple of releases. There’s a focus on street corner battle-tested rapping, the kind that places emphasis on the malleability of language and construction of unexpected wordplay; you can easily imagine them in a semi-circle, bobbing along to the beat, jumping in when it feels natural. Kenny Segal’s mixing keeps the vocals up front and mostly dry, giving the songs an immediate, inner monologue intimacy. The rappers are all in top form, operating in specific but complementary lanes. All three rap with a singsongy lilt, channeling the thoughtful whimsy you’d find on early De La Soul or Jungle Brothers records. Eagle is a master of unpredictable, multisyllabic rhyme schemes, peppered with sly, offbeat humor; RIFT deconstructs concepts and rearranges them into a series of interconnected reference points (his four-bar riff about Wesley Snipes on “White Hen” is especially dazzling). Video Dave exudes a happy melancholy, his verses often digging through his memories to excavate personal truths. Most songs forgo hooks in favor of mic-passing, making the album feel like a loving homage to the nearly lost art of parking lot cyphers after the rap show. Despite the deep influence of ’90s hip-hop culture, Service Merchandise isn’t hollow or throwback pastiche. Frequent OME collaborator Child Actor provides the lion’s share of the lush, trippy production, but Quelle Chris and Smoke Bonito’s beats are just as blurry. It’s as though they’re trying to recreate golden-era sounds armed with only the fog of memory and a faulty four-track. That loose, shaggy comfort allows the rappers to stumble upon moments of profound honesty and self-reflection. On the vaporous psychedelia of “Pliers,” RIFT issues a quick, devastating line about his drinking habits: “My vices love it when I grip them, and I know because they hold me back.” Dave gets wistful over a minor-key flute loop on “Fotomat,” turning a story of lying to his mother into a sober look at his conflict-avoidant tendencies. Eagle spends most of his closing verse on “White Hen”—an airy but lumbering boom-bap jam—questioning reality through a serpentine flow before declaring that he’s “the captain of a ship about to run in the ground.” Listening to Service Merchandise often feels like being let in on a fast-moving group chat, the kind where inside jokes and grinning shit talk sit comfortably next to heartfelt vulnerability. Previous Industries is a group forged from genuine camaraderie; these guys really trust each other, letting their shared memories of campy ’80s movies and afternoons spent watching Nickelodeon lead into deep conversations about the nature of existence. It’s a record shaped by the joy of rapping with your friends, spitting lines that evoke some good-natured jealousy. But most of all, this music could only be made after acknowledging there are fewer years in front of you than behind.",0,"July 8, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/previous-industries-service-merchandise/
Dorothy Carter,Troubadour,8.7,Folk/Country,"Dorothy Carter was in her early 40s when she recorded her largely instrumental, entirely entrancing album Troubadour. Although the 1976 release was her debut album, she had already lived many, many lives by then and enjoyed a storied career. An artist attracted to obscure, often unwieldy instruments, she studied music at Bard College and the Royal Academy of Arts, but it was a foregone conclusion that she would chafe at the rigidity of academia. She busked all over the world in search of new sounds and new inspirations, even spending a year at a convent in Mexico where she is said to have experienced epiphanic spiritual visions. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she played in an improvisational collective called the Central Maine Power Company with a handful of fellow eccentrics (including New Age pioneer Constance Demby), and Carter always provided a melodic counterpart to what they dubbed “not music.” But she found her greatest commercial success with the classical group Mediæval Bæbes, who in the ’90s rode a wave of interest in early music (in particular Gregorian chant, but also string ensembles) to something resembling popularity. Throughout her life, Carter amassed a collection of instruments that weren’t taught in music schools: zithers, hurdy-gurdys, psalteries, Irish harps, and more, some with so many modifications they barely resembled their original forms. She spent her final years in New Orleans, reportedly squatting in a warehouse that lacked heat and running water but had enough space for her musical menagerie. All the obsessions that motivated her entire career can be heard in Troubadour. Tracked at a small studio in Boston and featuring members of the Power Music Company, who produced and added flourishes of tamboura (an ancient Greek stringed instrument) and ch’in (a traditional Chinese zither), it plays like a map of Carter’s musical passions, tracing rivers and roads between folk tradition and avant-garde innovation. It found a small audience in the Boston and New York folk scenes, but didn’t travel much further. There’s no conspiracy here about label malfeasance or listener apathy. Carter never set out to make a record with overt gestures toward commercial viability, although perhaps Drag City’s new reissue will prompt a popular reappraisal, especially on the heels of last year’s repressing of Carter’s second album, the trippier, more vocal-oriented Waillee Waillee. As novel as an album of hammered dulcimer and psaltery might sound, Troubadour is not just accessible but bracing, full of big ideas and moments of disarming beauty. At the heart of the album is the dulcimer, an instrument whose sound is difficult to describe. When Carter strikes those taut strings with her hammers, she produces an unusual sound—pointillist? pixelated?—with a vivid, punchy slapback, as though we’re hearing the note and its immediate echo at the same time. Her rapid hammering on “Visiting Song” sounds like sculpted rain. Because she’s such a spirited player, it’s not hard to get lost in these songs, to lose track of time in the spiraling melody of “Lark in the Morning” or in the gentle pulse of “Masquerade,” one of only a few originals on Troubadour. That word “troubadour” has a long history stretching back to the Middle Ages, referring to traveling musicians who set verse to pre-existing melodies. Likewise, the dulcimer has a long history, though it is most commonly associated with Appalachia. Carter includes songs that reflect that connection—“The Cuckoo” and “Shirt of Lace”—but she finds ideas all over the world. Opener “Troubadour Song,” filled with intricate rhythm and intimate grandeur, is based on a French medieval melody. “Binnorie” hails from Scotland, “The King of Glory” from Israel; the delicate “Ukrainian Carol” plays very differently in 2024 than it might have in 1976. Rooted in an ancient Essene hymn, “Tree of Life” sounds like an hallucinogenic mushroom in musical form, while “Balinderry” and “The Morning Star” sound courtly and ordered, not unlike the early music explorations by Carter’s UK contemporaries John Renbourn and Bert Jansch. Perhaps the most startling moment on Troubadour happens four songs in, when Carter starts singing in a voice that is high and keening, spry and slightly brittle. That track, “Make a Joyful Sound,” quotes the Book of Psalms, specifically the part about making a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Carter invokes God not in a moralistic way but in a mystical, even metaphysical way. The song’s drone and thrum are so hypnotic as to be psychedelic, as though she wants you to know that “God” could be any unseen force, whichever deity you believe created so much beauty in the world. Rather than religiously prescriptive, her interpretation of those Bible verses is warmly eccentric, not to mention gracious and ecstatic—a thing of beauty in and of itself, much like the rest of this deeply philosophical album.

Ice Spice,Y2K!,7.6,Rap,"Ice Spice has described the year and a half between “Bully Freestyle” and “Munch” as taking “forever,” but things have moved a little faster since her breakout single: trending on TikTok, charting on Billboard, PinkPantheress collab, Nicki Minaj collab, Barbie soundtrack placement, Taylor Swift collab, four Grammy nominations. All of this has happened on the back of startlingly little music—last year’s Like..? EP essentially tripled the size of Spice’s discography with its 11-song deluxe version—but those songs have generally pointed towards a smoother, more emotive strain of NYC hip-hop, equally influenced by the Bronx and Top 40. Whether barrelling through a soul drill beat in her On The Radar freestyle or swooping and floating in AutoTune over the sparsely whirring “be a lady,” Ice Spice has mixed boilerplate tough talk with tossed-off vulnerability, positioning herself as relatably aspirational (or aspirationally relatable). Where Ice Spice has so far been happy playing the wide-eyed protagonist of a raunchy teen movie, Y2K! suggests that perhaps she’s been waiting to get mean this whole time. Save for a pair of DayGlo singles, these diabolical tracks thump, roil, and seethe their way into testing the limits of your subwoofer. Gone are the coyly romantic maneuverings of “Boy’s a liar pt. 2” and “Gangsta Boo;” ditto the softened ambient grooves of “In Ha Mood” and “Actin a Smoochie.” Following in the footsteps of “Munch (Feelin’ U)” and “Deli,” the instrumentals on her debut album are abrasive and unapologetic, and Ice Spice attacks them with her most dynamic vocals to date: whispering and barking, shouting and sneering. Having earned her pop laurels, Ice Spice comes across as totally uninterested in convincing her unbelievers or even feeding her fans: She just wants to drill. Incredibly, Y2K! succeeds even though her much-maligned “lyricism” has only gotten worse. Ice Spice has always been able to sell groan-inducing punchline bars (“I’m standing on shit like a floor mat” or “He eat it up like Pac-Man”) through committed delivery, but her fixation on a new nickname pushes the limits. Scatological rhymes are pretty blase for hip-hop, but “I’m Miss Poopie but I never smelt” and “I’m Miss Poopie like I need a diaper” are the sort of claims that would get you laughed out of daycare. Spice has said that she wants her lyrics to be “super simple” and “digestible,” but that can veer into insipid repetition, whether on interminably chanted hooks (“Oh Shhh…”) or recycled rhyme schemes (“clappers” and “slappers” is a go-to). Three-quarters into the album, she throws off the clunker, “Bitches switchin’ but they wasn’t trans.” Ice Spice has never been much of a lyrical rapper, but these moments are extra frustrating on Y2K! because they distract from a genuinely exciting and ambitious album. Individually, any one song here could be analogized and explained. This verse shows the Nicki Minaj influence (“Phat Butt”), this beat sounds like the Opium label (“Plenty Sun”), this track lowkey gives Kay Flock (“Gimmie a Light”). Collectively, this album sounds like nothing her peers could make, swerving from one sonic inspiration to the next. Even when bars are fumbled, Y2K! finds its footing thanks to Ice Spice’s agile and adaptable flow, assembling simple syllables into unusual cadences. At each turn, Ice Spice stretches her distinctive lower register to new timbres. There’s the 40-grit rasp of “Bitch I’m Packin’,” where Ice Spice wheezes, “His bitch ride it really good but I got better knees,” and the booming Young Chop soundalike “Popa,” where she affects a drawl that brings to mind Young M.A and Bktherula. She sounds incredibly annoyed demanding men sign NDAs before she cheats with them on “Plenty Sun,” then pops up like the demon emoji on “Did It First,” somehow managing to sound even less apologetic about infidelity than Mr. “Lucky for me I deleted the message” Central Cee. Drawing on drill’s decade-plus history between Chicago, New York, and London, as well as trendier Jersey club and rage beats, Y2K! doesn’t just surprise from track-to-track, but recasts the poppier singles as irregular components of a cohesive aesthetic vision. The silly Mike Dean synth breakdown on “Phat Butt” makes more sense as a Graduation-indebted album intro; tucked near the album’s close, a cheat code Sean Paul sample feels less like nostalgia bait than a flag proudly repping her sample-drill and Caribbean roots. Day one collaborator RiotUSA is behind the boards on every track, and Y2K! is a testament to the strength of their long-running creative partnership. Its weakest moments are those featuring outsiders—Gunna and Travis Scott just get absolutely rinsed here. What makes Y2K! so instantly memorable is Ice Spice’s refusal to be pigeonholed. Undaunted by the scrutiny of Swiftie affiliation or the pressure of living up to her previous sales peaks, Spice doubles down on the sounds she loves without compromise or quarter. A non-zero number of fans turned this album on because of PinkPantheress and “Karma (Remix)” only to be met with some of the gnarliest 808s on the planet. She already knows her Munchkins love the bops: Now she wants to see them mosh.",0,"July 29, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ice-spice-y2k/
Zayn,Room Under the Stairs,5.8,Pop/R&B,"Zayn’s solo career has been a series of fits and starts, a product of a modern pop landscape where being a talented singer is far from enough to capture the zeitgeist. It may have been a mistake to initially define himself by what he was not: not a Simon Cowell shill, not a squeaky-clean boy band idol, not above laborious concept albums. His chosen character of the brooding, afflicted Don Juan, provocative as it may be, is not exactly unique; even the Weeknd has begun working beyond its creative limits. And with ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS, Zayn seems to be finally casting off that tried-and-tested persona, at least to an extent. If you’ve ever tuned into SiriusXM’s The Coffee House station, you know what this album sounds like. Doing away with the pulsing, club-ready R&B of Zayn’s past solo work, Dave Cobb’s co-production paints a new backdrop of beachy guitar and live drums, playing into Zayn’s former One Direction role as the introspective crooner. “I’m finding my way on the highway this year,” he declares on “Concrete Kisses,” over sparkling keys and a meandering bassline. Recorded at his home in rural Pennsylvania, this is apparently meant to be Zayn’s coming-clean, “back to basics” record, channeling the likes of Chris Stapleton (another Cobb collaborator) and John Legend as a way of projecting sensitivity. The sound is pleasant enough, if a little too picturesque. The strongest entries are the trio of songs that Zayn didn’t co-write: “Stardust” is a gushy ode to new love, “Something in the Water” has Zayn doing his best Blonde impression, and “False Starts” carries a propulsion that’s sorely missing everywhere else. While not completely devoid of references to partying—“So fucked, I can’t feel my face”—ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS gestures towards a vaguer messiness of long-term relationships. “Take me as I am, I’m tired/Of dancing around the point,” Zayn sings on “What I Am,” then proceeds to spend the whole album doing just that. Apart from a few true groaners (“Got a big old cup of shit/Told me to drink it”), the lyrics are mostly forgettable mush, circuitous nothings like, “These days, I live to my depiction” (“Grateful”) or, “With no senses, ain’t no sentence/Making sense of us” (“Dreamin”). These garbled thoughts only reinforce the songs as background music—the soundtrack at a boardwalk cafe where you’re only meant to hear every third word, or the needle drops on reality TV whenever one contestant proposes to another. They’re not bad, per se, but they’re anonymous. ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS follows Zayn’s split from his on-again-off-again partner Gigi Hadid, which ended in 2021 when Zayn pleaded no contest to four charges of harassment for allegedly striking Hadid’s mother. Why, then, are relationship narratives on this album ambiguous to the point of meaninglessness? There’s a moment of startling emotional clarity on “Shoot at Will,” a revealing track where Zayn alludes to his and Hadid’s daughter: “When I look at her, all I see is you/When you look at her, do you see me too?” But for the most part, Zayn appears much more comfortable wearing the mask of vulnerability instead of actually exercising it.

Fake Fruit,Mucho Mistrust,7.6,Rock,"When she was 18, Hannah D’Amato auditioned for a spot at the Berklee College of Music. Midway through her audition, one of the male judges walked up to her guitar amp and lowered the volume knob. Demoralized and insulted, D’Amato decided to bypass the prestigious institution and start a band on her own. Thus the origin story of Fake Fruit, the Bay Area punk trio she’s been fronting over several incarnations since 2016. That sense of defiance courses through the band’s second album, and first for Carpark, Mucho Mistrust. In 12 tightly wound tracks, D’Amato and her bandmates, drummer Miles MacDiarmid and guitarist Alex Post, forge a rickety bridge between the righteous indignation of riot grrrl and the staccato unease of the UK’s post-punk revivalists. D’Amato’s plainspoken delivery and sneering wit provide the record’s center of gravity, as she monologues about a shitty ex (“You’ve got punisher’s lust/I’ve got mucho mistrust,” she quips in the title track), reckons with dwindling self-worth (“Well Song”), and bids adieu to a slimy narcissist who “made me look psycho” (“Psycho”). The album takes its name from a Blondie classic, but the nervy outbursts of “Psycho” and squawking, sax-addled no wave of “Gotta Meet You” have more in common with the paranoid racket of Bush Tetras. You could certainly draw a throughline between that group’s underground hit “Too Many Creeps” and the lyrical concerns of Fake Fruit, which prominently include scummy men, toxic romances, and the myriad ways humans can exploit one another. D’Amato, who left an unhappy relationship before making Mucho Mistrust, surveys these frustrations with such bluntness that listening to Fake Fruit often feels like overhearing one end of a heated phone call. “Who taught you to behave this way?” she asks at the start of “See It That Way,” opening the record in media res as dueling guitars snarl from one speaker to the other. But there are also surrealist detours—the wacky sprechgesang of “Venetian Blinds,” written and sung by Post, lightens the mood—and tracks that move in a more reflective direction. In the latter category, “Cause of Death” is strikingly good. Evoking the confounding mindfuck of an obsessive crush, the track slows and shifts keys midway through as the band rides out a dramatic refrain against a swelling choir of backup voices. It is the most moving and melodic Fake Fruit song to date, and it tees up the mood for “Sap,” the closest thing to a ballad on here, its mellow chords scuffed up just enough to let the bitterness seep through. Because of their talky vocals and post-punk lineage, and because they toured with Dry Cleaning in 2022, Fake Fruit could conceivably be slotted in with the UK’s vibrant cohort of talk-singing post-punk upstarts. But D’Amato’s vocals carry a distinctly American strain of directness—and unapologetic angst—that contrasts with the cryptic musings of, say, Florence Shaw. On “Más o Menos,” her sarcastic refrain—“I hope you had a good time on your sympathy tour/Hope you found everything that you were looking for”—even evokes Olivia Rodrigo’s breakup kiss-offs. There is detached cool in free-associative poetry, but there’s also power in saying what you mean and saying it loudly, Berklee admission committees be damned.

Syzy,The weight of the world,7.2,Electronic,"For a moment in the early 2010s, dubstep was the delirious new sound of the electronic world. The laser-bright synths and vomity wubs of sub-scenes like brostep and riddim took over from the stark, murky UK style of the aughts and set the festival circuit ablaze. We all know how that ended, but the style never really died, and now the kids who grew up mainlining music from Monstercat and Trap Nation are throwing up their own futuristic insanity and calling it dubstep. Perhaps the most thrilling new-gen producer is Syzy—a virtuosic sound designer whose new album, The weight of the world, is the genre’s most intoxicating debut in years. The California producer has worked in the shadows for a while now, dropping a couple of ear-lacerating dubstep EPs and experimenting with madcap side quests in the SoundCloud underworld. They made dariacore mashup weirdness and internet-fried Jersey club as a member of the anarchic collective TwerkNation28; cult streamer iShowSpeed hijacked one of their beats for an infectious viral hit. The weight of the world combines these zany impulses with pristine technical know-how. It’s an artful take on a genre often reviled as mindless carnage. These songs feel like gazing at pixelated constellations where synth shards glisten between dark clouds of bass fog. Syzy stacks the songs’ sumptuous intros and outros with vocal slivers, infernal burbles, and ASMR-soft twinkles. Ornate drops feel less suited for raving than paying close attention. “HEART123” sparkles madly, as if a glacier could be stretched like an accordion. The ecstatic climax of “Caught up (in circles)” is like seeing color after a life of monochrome. “Get a grip!” deftly ratchets up the tension, then pops two drops in quick succession: The first is gnarly but it’s a pump fake compared to the fantastically feculent second, which resembles a robot-monster puking a torrent of neon-green bile. The weight of the world feels so immersive partly because Syzy didn’t intend it to be purely functional. Rather than macho bass or daredevil drops, the artist cites hyperpop and homespun alt-rock (like twikipedia’s “seams”) as primary influences on this record’s emotionally vertiginous sound palette. The eruption of chattering noise on the intro smacks of Jane Remover’s “kodak moment.” The kitschy “Eureka!” sample motif is redolent of something off an Underscores tape. “In your face!” shivers with Rustie-shiny synths, as if bass wizard G Jones took a course in PC Musicology. The five-minute outro to “Experience (HIGHER)” is so packed with blurred bleeps and pixelated mist it’s like shoegaze for cyborgs. The few audible lyrics—sampled refrains and digicore singer kmoe’s windswept feature—don’t paint a coherent narrative, but a sensitive vulnerability comes across in dreamy, minimal passages and songs like “Dancing on my own,” a possible tribute to Robyn’s similarly bittersweet anthem. Several track titles read like urgent imperatives, perhaps directed at Syzy themselves, as if each soaring keyboard squiggle and bass blow-up were a plot point in a poignant internal conflict. By the end, the constant build-drop flow starts to get constrictive. Predictable rise-and-falls have long been a liability in dubstep, and here, they feel at odds with textures and sounds as layered and hyperreal as 3D models. You long for Syzy to shatter the structure and inject some surprises from their SoundCloud toolkit, like unhinged nightcore vocals or deliciously organic ambient tones. On highlight “DOPE1!” a new idea warps in every second: dariacore’s pulverized vocal gibberish, brostep’s cheeky taunts, the quivery electricity of color bass, even an amped-up Dragon Ball Z sound effect. That might sound excruciatingly dense, but Syzy and featured guest Olswel weave it perfectly. The weight of the world sounds simultaneously similar to and absolutely nothing like the juddering mayhem of EDM dubstep’s golden age: powered by festival-sized energy yet sculpted for meditative headphone listening. It’s the frenetic, heartfelt work of a young production obsessive honoring a genre but tearing it up at the same time.",0,"July 11, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/syzy-the-weight-of-the-world/
Peter Cat Recording Co.,BETA,7.4,Rock,"Over the past 14 years, Indian indie-rock veterans Peter Cat Recording Co. have perfected their own particular style of fusion. They travel across time and geography, plundering sounds and aesthetics—early-20th-century cabaret, 1950s vocal jazz, 1960s soul, 1970s Bollywood, and early-2000s indie rock—and assembling these transcultural artifacts into improbable collages, warping their references’ familiarity into something more subversive, and occasionally a little sinister. They follow that blueprint to excellent effect on “People Never Change,” the lead single off their latest album, BETA. The dholak and iktara that kick things off suggest the sort of earthy Punjabi folk pop that is inescapable at North Indian weddings, then feint left by adding sub-aquatic bass synth and jazz saxophone. The song constantly mutates, weaving a dizzying, six-and-a-half-minute path through funk, disco, bossa nova, and psychedelia. But though they borrow heavily from previous eras, PCRC are driven by the urge to move forward, rousing the ghosts of the past to interrogate the fault lines of the present, both personal and political. Such creative restlessness has always been central to the PCRC ethos, especially in the years they spent gestating in the Indian rock underground. Their catalog is full of abrupt left turns: from cinematic cabaret-punk to surrealistic soundscapes of noise and found sound, from psychedelic slow waltzes to mutant amalgamations of guitar drone and James Chance-esque trumpet. The only constants have been a seemingly limitless capacity for surprising their fans and frontman Suryakant Sawhney’s seductive 1950s croon, marinated in subtle, self-aware melancholy. BETA—which means “son” in Hindi, a reference to drummer Karan Singh recently becoming a father—builds on the dizzying stylistic shifts and artful studio trickery of their 2019 breakthrough Bismallah, smashing disparate sounds, eras, and cultural traditions together to create entirely new sound worlds, each composition an exercise in alternate history and speculative fiction. The chromatic synths and distorted bass pulses of “21c” conjure up a ballroom from the 2050s, marrying old-world grace with space-age synths. “Black and White” opens with an MBV-esque wall of guitar noise that gives way to a propulsive funk groove and blown-out bass synths as the song mutates from shoegaze freakout to the bastard love child of bossa nova, disco, and rave. Elsewhere, PCRC move their sound further into the sunlight, dabbling in subtropical psychedelia and the bucolic wistfulness of early-2000s indie folk. On opener “Flowers R. Blooming,” ghungroo, swarsangam, clarinet, and acoustic guitar coalesce into a shimmering wash of sound, invoking the pastoral beauty of the North Indian heartland. “I Deny Me”—a rousing ballad about the redemptive power of music, written and sung by bassist Dhruv Bhola—sounds like it would fit seamlessly into the Garden State soundtrack, all soulful warble and earnest finger-plucked guitar. This shift might be partly attributed to a move from the urban chaos of New Delhi to the scenic, sleepy village of Olaulim in North Goa, where the band spent much of the pandemic holed up together. Many of these songs were first written or recorded there, in a run-down 18th-century cottage owned by a Catholic priest. You can hear the influence of the coastal state’s bucolic beauty and slow way of life in the group’s newfound predilection for blissed-out serenity and arcadian soundscapes (and, more directly, in the snatches of field recordings they scatter across the record). But the sunnier sound is also a reflection of the band members’ personal evolution, most evident in the growing maturity and introspection of their songwriting. They’re still drawing from the same well of inspiration—human frailty, self-doubt, navigating a world hell-bent on its own destruction—but marriage, fatherhood, and age have shifted their perspective (in a recent interview they call themselves a “daddy band”). Where once Sawhney would have approached the prospect of impending apocalypse with a macabre glee, now he finds himself open to the possibility of redemption. Smirking cynicism and wry nihilism no longer cut it. Hope, once looked on with sneering suspicion, is now essential. Album highlight “Suddenly,” which floats on a bed of jangly acoustic guitar and gently brushed drums, begins as an elegy to the father Sawhney lost in his teens but transforms into a long-overdue acknowledgement of his mother’s resilience, informed by the sort of awareness that only comes when you are confronted with the notion of becoming a parent yourself. Sawhney’s lyrics still retain his rakish irreverence and wry, self-effacing humor, but they’re enriched by a deeper understanding of the human condition and the universality of our emotional struggles. BETA falters toward the end as the band drops its signature maximalist fusion for overly sincere blog-rock-era indie. Just as your attention begins to flag, though, you’re hit with the synth-rock freakout of “Connexion” and the jazz-age-meets-space-age ballad “A Beautiful Life,” the album’s gorgeous closer. “Beautiful life, lives in my mind/If I could only seize it,” Sawhney sings, yearning for an utopia almost within reach. There’s something almost hymn-like about the way he vocalizes those lines, a feeling that’s only amplified once you’ve seen a crowd sing along to it, shading the words with their own fears and doubts. More than the stylistic experiments and production flourishes, it’s that open vulnerability, and the invitation to share in it, that make BETA such a compelling record.",0,"August 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/peter-cat-recording-co-beta/
Wand,Vertigo,7.3,Rock,"The West, to quote the Lizard King, is the best. In the years since Jim Morrison committed that bit of boosterism to wax, the synecdoche between a few hundred miles of California coast and our whole hegemonic civilization has only become more darkly involved. Thankfully, this same ballyhooed complex of energy, spectacle, and violence offers a handy template for processing ongoing developments on its political, aesthetic, and psychic frontiers: aptly, the Western. Vertigo, Wand’s sixth studio album, is undoubtedly a Western—albeit in the contemporary style. Like the cinematic interpretations by Monte Hellman and Jim Jarmusch, it’s a meditation on inner frontiers, where borders constrict, identities shift, and maps go blank. Once upon a time, the Los Angeles quartet excelled at music fit for touring Mulholland Drive on research chemicals. Vertigo, by contrast, beats its vagabond retreat to the desert—to a Llano del Rio or Spahn Ranch of the mind. Its pleasures, consequently, are furtive and indirect, scattering like reptiles from an overturned stone. At the heart of Vertigo is not a narrative so much as fugitive guideposts through life’s fractured final cycle. From out of a haze of electric guitar texture, opener “Hangman” shuffles the mandala mid-tempo that will sustain much of the album. Frontman Cory Hanson’s voice is somber, shell-shocked; the tale a sketch without fixed subject or object. “Somebody’s trying to disappear/I guess I will find out/I’m gonna see you here tomorrow/I’m gonna be left out…” A dream before dying or the memory of a blackboard guessing game? The hangman carries out his sentence, but he also eases us on our way. In this sludgy fever’s subsidence, extended coda “Curtain Call” suggests a soul’s ascent, its destination still uncertain. Vertigo, too, emerges from a moment of uncertainty for the band. A four-year recording hiatus saw the departures of keyboardist Sofia Arreguin and founding bassist Lee Landey. Hanson, in the meantime, notched two formidable solo albums (recorded with help from Wand guitarist Robbie Cody and new bassist Evan Backer) whose energetic blend of folk, power pop, and progressive rock threatened intermittently to eclipse the main event. Ever resilient, Wand have conscientiously retooled their sound, crafting songs that seem excavated instead from the kind of cosmic post-rock improvisations first teased on 2022’s live album Spiders in the Rain. The result is a second debut of sorts, an act of self-definition in negative, at once a settling in and a shearing away. Gone is their past material’s giddy, lysergic bounce; instead, drummer Evan Burrows pours a spacious, continual foundation where melodies rise through repetition, and rich details (with string and wind arrangements courtesy of Backer) slither and swim. The members of Wand would probably be first to acknowledge that this is ambitious stuff—something akin to the tabula rasa of Pygmalion or Spirit of Eden, a whole of metamorphic parts—and thus not without pitfalls. The glistening, incantatory back half of “JJ” must still overcome a somewhat muddled takeoff. Elsewhere, atmospheres can linger indistinctly; at length, you come to miss Hanson’s mischievous persona and the old band’s monster-movie licks. Vertigo is not all evasion, however. Clouds part around lead single “Smile,” which revels in the band’s easy-riding FM radio influences, scanning for a frequency of longing to cut through our sketch-like desperado’s fatigue. And “High Time,” built from a percussive feedback pulse, seemingly from the top floor down, cascades into a deliriously layered sturm und drang, receding again in a vapor trail of strings and static, headed for the sunset. But the essence of Vertigo remains defiantly (even frustratingly) in the eerie, interlinked soundworld designed around its peaks. Closer “Seaweed Head” stamps a mystic image on a twilit anti-climax, its flickerings the closest approximation of vertigo itself—the false perception of movement in stillness. “Find it really hard to see the ray/Got you green upside down in the month of May/Someone’s gonna tell you there’s nothing left to hide/Someone’s gonna bring you back through the other side…” Of course, the pervasiveness of motion is a scientific truth, and a spiritual one as well. Whether what awaits our hanged man is revelation, or some return to the primordial source, no one is saying. Vertigo is a welcome return for one of our most fascinating bands, in L.A. or anywhere else. That they’ve arrived with seemingly nothing to lose only heightens anticipation for what’s still to come.

Arab Strap,I’m totally fine with it 👍 don’t give a fuck anymore 👍,7.8,Rock,"While Arab Strap always seemed out of step with overground indie-rock trends during their Y2k-era initial run, the Scottish duo’s second act couldn’t have been more perfectly timed—and not just because the current UK indie landscape is over-populated with melody-averse monologists sharing vivid slice-of-life vignettes with a painterly touch. Their first album in 16 years, As Days Get Dark, arrived in early 2021 in the thick of the pandemic, and its thematic concerns—from social media addiction to the porn habits that fill the void in sexless relationships—perfectly aligned with a moment when much of our communication became mediated through screens, and the chasm between virtual connectivity and IRL isolation was widening at a perilous pace. For a hyper-analytical songwriter like Aidan Moffat, all the subsequent cultural turmoil that COVID helped spawn is the gift that keeps on giving. In a pre-smartphone era, Moffat and partner Malcolm Middleton were the novelistic narrators of twentysomething Scottish life and all the awkward conversations that transpire after the pubs clear out for the night. Now, with their second post-comeback effort, I’m totally fine with it 👍 don’t give a fuck anymore 👍, they stand among indie rock’s most astute observers of human behavior in the digital age. Listening to these songs still feels like you’re eavesdropping on Moffat’s intimate exchanges and innermost thoughts, but now, more than ever, his narratives are firmly plugged into our unsettled collective consciousness. Moffat probably could have written the lyrics to “Sociometer Blues” back in 1998, as a window into a disintegrating dysfunctional relationship: “You take all my time, you take all my strength, you steal my love, you are the worst friend I ever had.” But the sense of exasperation and desperation is amplified upon realizing the song’s object of desire is his mobile device. Critiquing technology’s dissociative effects is hardly the hottest take, and this isn’t even the only new indie-rock album on the subject to come out this week. But where so much of the discussion around being Extremely Online usually centers on mental health—the way the internet feeds on both ego and insecurity, and how its endless flow of information atomizes attention spans into milliseconds—I’m totally fine with it’s imposing opener, “Allatonceness,” catalogs its corrosive effects in corporeal terms. The song begins with the sound of an old-school modem making a dial-up connection—a cheeky callback from a band that was born at the dawn of the home-internet era, but also an instant-villain origin story of how we got to our current hellscape overpopulated by sedentary keyboard warriors with “atrophied legs.” The song’s queasy, quicksand-thick bass groove further reinforces the symbiotic relationship between habitual computer usage and physical stagnation. As “Allatonceness” makes clear, Moffat is having a field day digging into the darkest crevices of online culture, and that devious enthusiasm likewise rubs off on the duo’s musical choices. Arab Strap may never fully shake their sad-bastard reputation, but I’m totally fine with it features some of their punchiest productions to date, expanding the cheeky “disco Spiderland” template of its predecessor into more forceful displays of rhythm and discord. Where they once wrote songs about dancing and getting fucked up, “Bliss” actually sounds like a peak-hour electro club thumper, while “Strawberry Moon” suggests the Fall making ‘80s breakdance jams. And “Turn Off the Light” could be the closest this group has gotten to crafting a festival-sized power ballad—though in typically perverse Arab Strap fashion, the song’s seemingly uplifting sentiments (“You came/And showed me the answers”) actually detail one impressionable man’s descent into conspiracy-theory lunacy. As much as I’m totally fine with it delights in targeting the trolls who make the internet so inhospitable, the album extends the same grace and understanding to its shitposting subjects as you would to any person beset by a self-destructive addiction beyond their control. The sympathetic first-person perspective of “Turn Off the Light” seems to suggest that the roiling cesspool of disinformation can pull in anyone feeling lost and alone. And while it’s easy enough to condemn the deleterious psychological effects of smartphone dependency, for some of Moffat’s characters, it’s the only thing keeping them sane in a cruel world. With its deceptive ’80s soft-rock sparkle, “You’re Not There” tricks you into thinking Moffat is singing a wistful breakup ballad about an ex-lover who’s no longer returning his messages, until you realize the woman he’s pining for is actually dead, and that texting her is the only way he can fill the void in his heart and home. And as “Safe & Well” suggests, the only thing more frightening than getting sucked into the self-promotional hamster wheel of social media is what happens when you live anonymously: Over a mournful folk arrangement, Moffat recounts the based-on-a-true-story tale of a woman who died in her flat near the beginning of the pandemic, and wasn’t discovered for another two years. In Moffat’s account, no horrifying detail is spared—maggots and all. On I’m totally fine with it 👍 don’t give a fuck anymore 👍, Arab Strap come to terms with the many ways in which the pandemic fundamentally altered the human experience, by turning hostile discourse, endless scrolling, FOMO panic, and polarizing politics into our default mode, while dampening the desire to seek out real-world experience even as the world returns to a state of business as usual. “Sun is shining, I don’t care,” Moffat admits on “Summer Season,” as he opts to drink alone in his flat, reply to his messages, and make noncommittal plans for in-person meet-ups that will probably never happen. It’s the moment where the nihilistic title sentiment of I’m totally fine with it 👍 don’t give a fuck anymore 👍 is felt most acutely, revealing a truth that few would be willing to admit: The only thing more painful than living through lockdown is missing it.

Role Model,Kansas Anymore,5.8,Pop/R&B,"Tucker Pillsbury sure looks like a pop star. He’s got the movie-star good looks, a collection of trendy tattoos, and an eccentric Fashion Week wardrobe. The 27-year-old Maine native nearly landed a role in HBO’s Euphoria but was passed up for Dominic Fike, another suave, tattooed singer. Like Fike, Pillsbury has struggled to channel his on-camera charisma into compelling music. Since 2017, he’s released room-temperature pop as Role Model, portraying himself as a sweet-natured yet mentally tortured heartbreaker. He’s clearly inspired by alt-pop heroes Frank Ocean and BROCKHAMPTON, but his music mostly resembles Shawn Mendes if Mendes were a mediocre singer. “I want something on the radio,” Pillsbury told GQ in 2022. Shuffle through his catalog and you’ll hear an artist desperately searching for a star-making moment. Pillsbury’s second album, Kansas Anymore, is a step in the right direction. It’s a compact, confident, and well-produced pop-rock record about breaking up with one of Gen Z’s most influential stars, Emma Chamberlain, who has served as Pillsbury’s muse two records in a row. Rx, his 2022 full-length debut, was a frictionless and frequently excruciating collection of lyrically bland, Imagine Dragons-indebted love songs. While Kansas Anymore has shortcomings—cutesy choruses, unadventurous melodies, middling vocal performances—its personality and songcraft are more mature and palatable than any of Pillsbury’s past work. Though it makes a few bids for radio singles, Kansas Anymore seems less concerned with landing a hit than it does building a sturdy home to hang out in. Pillsbury and executive producer Noah Conrad draw from a folk-pop playbook of Fleetwood Mac and Kacey Musgraves to pen a selection of sunny, sentimental songs. “Look at That Woman” is pleasantly arranged with bright acoustics, slide guitar, and grand piano, and Pillsbury maneuvers well within his vocal range, cruising through plainspoken verses before stretching into a faint falsetto hook. In slower moments, like on the beautifully raw “Slut Era Interlude” or the silky Lizzy McAlpine duet “So Far Gone,” he winds his way into genuinely moving melodies; when he croons “I don’t want you but I want you to spend the night,” it sounds like he really feels what he’s singing. It’s a first for Pillsbury: He elicits a sincere emotional reaction, and he’s not playacting. There is definitely some playacting on this record, though. Pillsbury’s stomp-clap pivot feels slightly forced considering the recent success of artists like Zach Bryan and Noah Kahan. (“The Dinner” is a full-on Kahan rip—or Mumford & Sons, blame whoever you want.) Still, the role of cowboy-hatted songwriter suits Pillsbury better than the swaggering bad boy character he sought to cultivate on Rx, where he sang “I’d die for my bitch” with the conviction of a boy-band backup. In this softer, more contemplative mode, he’s an occasionally deft writer: “If I was younger, I’d take a downer/Lay on the carpet, pills on the counter/If I was lonely, I’d call up Rachel/Be there in twenty, jeans at her ankles,” he sings on “Slipfast.” He’s still prone to a weak chorus—the punchline on “Superglue” is a wincer—but Kansas Anymore proves Pillsbury to be a sensitive and competent songwriter, even when the G-C-D-major chords and verse-chorus archetypes wear thin. Despite some biting moments, the album-wide breakup narrative also loses intrigue. Pillsbury admits to masochistically reveling in disillusion, embracing “the feeling of letting it all burn down.” But voyeurs looking to get a documentarian view into his and Chamberlain’s private lives—and the album’s marketing certainly alludes to this possibility—will be disappointed. For all Pillsbury’s claims that he’s a “scumbag,” he’s quick to a cliché, and even quicker to a cheery silver lining. He wants what’s right for her; he tried his best; maybe they’re still meant to be? Without show-stopping talent or anything that truly differentiates him from the gaggle of guys who hope to blow up like Zach Bryan, he remains stuck in pop star limbo. He looks the part, but the role may already be filled. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Gel,,7.8,Rock,"In the roughly year and a half since Only Constant, Gel barely came up for air. The New Jersey hardcore punks scooped up new drummer Alex Salter, toured nonstop, and signed to a new record label, Blue Grape. Life was so busy that Gel had to wedge themselves into a remote cabin to hash out new songs before their tour schedule swallowed them whole. Once there, they heeded the advice that closed out Only Constant: “Navigate boldly, act with intent.” Those sessions birthed a five-song EP, Persona, that’s bigger and bolder than anything they’ve recorded before. But in true Gel fashion, the freaks are top of mind. Recorded over two weeks and inspired by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung’s concept of the shadow self, singer Sami Kaiser digs up the repulsive, unflattering parts of their own subconscious with an honesty that verges on self-punishment; the title track’s threat (“Don’t forget your fucking place”) sounds as much like an indictment of frauds as it does a self-reminder. To further enhance that, the band approaches the definitive Gel aggression with newfound musical aplomb. Kaiser’s bellows foam with spittle, as if the greed and conceit they’re lambasting is contagious. For guitarist Anthony Webster, it takes shape in guitar tones modeled after Obituary and Swervedriver. Both bassist Mathew Bobko and guitarist Maddi Nave bet on tried-and-true punk without shying away from melody. Even Salter tightens his drumming so the opening, isolated quarter notes of “Mirage” hit as hard as the D-beat barrage in “Martyr.” EP highlight “Shame” represents Gel’s most notable growth with an embrace of studio production. The old metrics for “selling out” in the ’90s, long since expired in the punk world, are slowly draining out of the hardcore community, too; these days, fans bicker over studio-grade gloss in Discord chats but still buy tickets for the show. Gel navigate the leveling-up process on Persona like their hometown heroes Thursday or My Chemical Romance did before them by hiring a producer who understands their ambitions. Jon Markson (Drug Church, Drain) is a steady hand at Gel’s mixing console, turning up the volume as bridges build and drawing out individual members’ parts for efficient contrast that doesn’t feel too clean. Throughout Persona, Gel retain their menacing power not in spite of the production, but in concert with it. Markson whittles Webster and Nave’s guitar riffs into sharp prongs until they interlace like zipper teeth. Salter’s drum hits pummel with the energy of a raucous basement set that’s properly mic’d. Even when Kaiser’s venomous yells border on actual singing, like in the alt-rock chorus of “Shame,” Markson never goes heavy on reverb. In a swift but precise deboning, Gel extract their scrappier instincts and Markson loudly fills in the gaps. Take closer “Vanity,” which opens with a thick sludge of power chords fit for a metal song. It’s poisonous and gnarled, even as it thins into a trusty hardcore breakdown, complete with Gel’s signature tempo change-ups. As a transitory release, Persona is the best of both worlds: just as ferocious and unrelenting, but with bolder production and deeper hooks.

Justice,Hyperdrama,6.3,Electronic,"For a brief spell on Hyperdrama, Justice’s fourth studio album, it’s 1991 all over again and the rave gods are raining down lightning bolts from on high. Justice have always been time travelers, and on “Generator,” the album’s second track, they zap us back to the past with a serrated synth that tears across the stereo field like the Jaws of Life ripping through a crumpled Delorean. The sound is a reference to Joey Beltram’s oft-sampled “Mentasm,” a cornerstone of early-’90s hardcore techno and everything loud and rude—jungle, gabber, breakcore, and, however tenuously, Ed Banger itself—that followed. It might be the heaviest thing the French duo has ever set to tape; given their history (hard-rock riffs, Marshall stacks, a song called “Heavy Metal”), that’s saying something. But that very heaviness also makes the song an outlier on the album, because Justice have never sounded more polished. Magpies in leather jackets, with cigarettes forever dangling from their lips, Justice used to make a point of being provocative. Their records were awash in jagged sawtooths, clashing frequencies, and bit-crushed drums. They brought playground swagger to hits like “D.A.N.C.E.” and winkingly channeled stadium-rock dinosaurs on prog behemoths like “New Lands.” But on Hyperdrama, their first album in eight years, they sound professional, meticulous, and surprisingly grown up. This time, rather than the ersatz hard rock of their debut, the ostentatious prog of Audio, Video, Disco., or even the disco AOR of Woman, they channel the cocktail of dance and ’80s pop developed in the 1990s by their French touch forebears, particularly Alan Braxe, whose “Music Sounds Better With You” (made with Daft Punk’s Thomas Bangalter and the singer Benjamin Diamond, as the trio Stardust) set the gold standard for Gallic dance pop. It’s a slick sound, sleekly aerodynamic and expensively appointed, and buffed to an ultra-vivid sheen. On the opening “Neverender,” Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker floats atop a sumptuous bed of pulsing keys; the claps and cymbals are so crystalline that they might be jewels in a vitrine. The choral pads, car-chase arpeggios, and starry-eyed crescendo of “Dear Alan”—surely a tribute to Braxe himself—are as sumptuous as the wriggly disco-funk bassline is spry. Track after track is bathed in a hyperreal glow that’s a world away from the duo’s scuzz-encrusted early work. At some point, Justice apparently traded their cigarettes for vapes, and something of that transition feels palpable in the toned-down sound of Hyperdrama: the discreet tug instead of the defiant drag, the blue LED in place of the burning ember. Incongruous mash-ups, like the disco vamps and grueling techno of their 2007 single “Stress,” have been part and parcel of Justice’s music from the beginning, but on Hyperdrama, digital/analog hybrids—like Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories, or, indeed, a gleaming, futuristic vape pen—assume subtler forms. In “Generator,” the duo offsets the apocalyptic “Mentasm” stabs and pumping piano-house chords with sprightly disco bass, as though flickering between Fantazia and Studio 54. It’s a novel juxtaposition, and skillfully executed, though something about its “Hey! You got chocolate in my peanut butter!” setup feels slightly too clever, better suited for a creative director’s mood board than the messiness of an actual dancefloor. “Afterimage” performs a similar bait-and-switch, balancing doomy techno synths with the breathy rapture of guest singer Rimon’s ecstatic sighs, but the contrast isn’t quite provocative enough to save the song’s expression of bliss from sounding generic. It doesn’t help that most of the guest singers Justice employ here—Parker, Rimon, Miguel, Thundercat, and Manchester electro-pop duo the Flints—opt for a similar falsetto range, making them all sound interchangeable. The clash of the totems is more interesting on “Moonlight Rendez-Vous,” a two-minute sketch that poses an unusual thought experiment: What if Wham!’s “Careless Whisper” had been recorded in the style of Vangelis’ Blade Runner soundtrack? The album’s best tracks are the most audacious: the unbridled joy of “Dear Alan,” a veritable fireworks display of pinwheeling arps and halo effects; the over-the-top prog-disco fusion of “Incognito,” which builds to a distorted climax reminiscent of Justice’s rebellious early hijinks, now rendered in state-of-the-art hi-def. But too much of it is simply too smooth—ploddingly mid-tempo, curiously risk averse. Nine songs into a 13-track run, “Explorer” bogs down in a morass of Phantom of the Opera synths; “Muscle Memory,” which follows, could have been a chance to show off their analog chops, but instead it feels like a Stranger Things retread—a synthwave set piece that’s been done many times before. Justice don’t call their guest performers features; instead, the singers are credited with “starring” roles. A minor detail, perhaps, but one that speaks to the duo’s aims. Like Daft Punk, they’ve always understood the power of a strong visual, and those “starring” credits suggest they’re thinking of Hyperdrama in terms of spectacle—if not a movie, then a headlining festival slot. At Coachella this month, the duo stood stock still and let their light show do most of the work, while the disembodied voice of Kevin Parker looped into a crescendoing approximation of the kind of techno that’s only fleetingly audible within Hyperdrama’s carefully tended grounds. It’s hard to escape the sensation that, beneath the album’s pristine surface, there are two dynamics at war: the insouciant energy of “Incognito” versus predictable, frictionless, strangely inoffensive anthems like “Neverender.” The eccentric versus the consummate professional; the maverick versus the safe bet. Yet for an album called Hyperdrama, actual tension—the kind of friction that once made Justice’s music feel so vital—is otherwise frustratingly hard to find.

Th Blisks,Elixa,7.8,Electronic,"It’s easy enough to identify Th Blisks’ component parts—trip-hop, torch song, post-punk, bedroom pop. It’s harder to pin down the distended, discombobulating result. Troth’s Amelia Besseny and Cooper Bowman and Low Life member Yuta Matsumura make washed-out indie dub pop songs that sound like old train cars rattling along, faded boom-bap loops and metallic post-punk guitars taking the place of dinged-up tracks and twanging overhead wires. The Australian trio made its new album, Elixa, remotely while living in Hobart, Newcastle, and Papunya, a small community outside Alice Springs. But if Elixa doesn’t quite belong to any one real place, its peculiar ambiance evokes a sprawling, desiccated urban landscape of the mind. How So?, Th Blisks’ 2022 debut, felt similarly unclassifiable: from the mondegreen-ish band name and song titles—“A Sylph,” “Taipei Dubble”—to the album cover, which featured (I think) portraits of each band member made of pebbles, it felt like an entryway into an alternate universe where the primary building blocks of pop music are melodica and drum machine. Elixa provides a clearer picture of whatever weird liminal zone Th Blisks are transmitting from: The textures and core materials are largely the same, but it feels more spacious, less lo-fi. Besseny’s vocals are still largely illegible, but occasionally a fragment of what she’s saying adds to Elixa’s air of laid-back benevolence: “It’s not without, it’s not within,” she sings on “Enchancity,” her reedy voice drifting over the beat; on “Knuckledust,” she sings of “a good place to start” over a track that sounds like “Steal My Sunshine” after a collective barbiturate overdose. The positivity within Besseny’s lyrics—“Looking for a faith/Without all the fiction,” she sings on “Do You Bless It?”—speaks to a primary appeal of Elixa: This sideways and detuned music nonetheless still conveys brightness. That’s not all it contains, though: The cavernous dirge “No Know” and the ghostly processional “Umbrah” temper Th Blisks’ warmth with a sinister, creeping edge. If you were to test a sample of Elixa’s DNA, you might trace its genealogy back to sensuous, strange ’90s artists like the Japanese trip-hop singer Poison Girl Friend or fogged-out Melbourne band Hydroplane. Th Blisks also feel like contemporaries of fellow Australians a.s.o. and YL Hooi, who releases music via Bowman’s Altered States label. Besseny’s vocals sometimes recall Grimes circa Geidi Primes. That swath of references is mostly to say that Elixa belongs to a broad canon of music that seems to exist a millimeter or two outside the space and time in which it was actually released: the soundtrack of a city that doesn’t exist and probably never will.",0,"June 25, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/th-blisks-elixa/
Cash Cobain,PLAY CASH COBAIN,7.7,Rap,"PLAY CASH COBAIN, the new full-length erotica from Queens horndog Cash Cobain, may have the most mentions of pussy eating of any album in existence. Honestly, what else could you want? Cash, a rapper and producer, is one half of the duo (with Chow Lee) who made 2 Slizzy 2 Sexy, a 2022 mixtape that loaded familiar samples into the club-drill blender, slurring melodies and generating too many deranged, pornographic punchlines to keep track of. That project was provocative, fun as hell, and hyper-fixated on the five boroughs and Long Island, coming at a time when a lighter, lower-stakes alternative to NYC drill—increasingly defined by death, jail, and opportunism—was needed. Fast forward to 2024 and somehow, those roots have bloomed into an entire subgenre that I have reluctantly accepted will be remembered as “sexy drill,” a fusion of New York drill, Jersey club, and player R&B like Brent Faiyaz and PND. Damn near every week it feels like there’s a new rapper in the towns or from out of state riding the wave started by Cash. The excess supply has watered down the sound a bit, but I can’t say I’m ever mad to hear his producer tag: “This beat from Cash not from YouTube.” Actually, I can barely remember a day in New York this summer where I didn’t catch one of his freak-a-thons blasting in the wild. There was “Dunk Contest,” a breezy shoutout fest to all the real-life girls he’s thirsting after—it’s dirty but also kind of sweet. Also “Fisherrr,” a lush back-and-forth with Queens’ Bay Swag that manages to pay homage to Black New York (“And yo’ ass fat, know you eat your rice and your cabbage too”) while remaining so relentlessly horny. And “Rump Punch,” a seductive groove that sounds like having a drunk, sloppy grind session at the West Indian Day Parade. All three singles are on PLAY CASH COBAIN, a 19-song test of endurance that effectively stamps this summertime moment by doubling down on his city-specific sexcapades. Sidestepping the open arms of mainstream rap, Cash takes the album in an intimate and moody direction. His tequila-breathed, speak-sing serenades make me think of Future songs where it feels like he’s stuck in a loop of club nights and one night stands that only leave him more empty. Cash is having those same types of nights, except less lavish, and when he leaves the next morning he’s caught in an obsessive sexual tryst like William Hurt in Body Heat. “When your friends ask who your nigga I just hope you mention me/And whenever I’m not with you I just hope you missing me,” he sings on the featherweight “wassup wya,” completely infatuated. On “Turks (I Apologize),” it’s as if he’s whispering a combination of dirty talk and promises he probably won’t keep in the ear of the woman he’s trying to win over. That’s true of the sultry second half of “cantsleep/drunkinluv,” too, where he begs, “Baby tell me when you’re pullin’ up/Or I can come pick you up/Or I can send a black truck,” like he can’t live without her. Seconds later, in a near-falsetto, he admits what it’s really all about: “I’m in love with your fat butt/In ’n’ out til’ I get that nut/In ’n’ out til’ I make her cum, like damn.” To be real, Cash’s lyrics are more often silliness like, “She got a nickname for my dick, it’s Ed, ’cause it’s Hardy/The other nickname for my dick is Jeff, it be Hardy.” His self-produced beats do more talking than his words, filling in emotional blanks with a 4o-esque fogginess and R&B samples that add some longing to his nonstop raunchiness. The Tyrese flip on “Act Like,” merged with Cash’s clubbish laser beams and lunch table drums, gives the feeling of falling hard after a lapdance at the stripper joint. On “Slizzy Poetry Pt. 2,” he dryly goes, “I’m tryna’ eat your pussy in the tropics/I’m tryna’ eat your pussy on an island/I’m tryna’ eat your pussy like it’s salmon,” but the stripped-down Hawaiian steel guitar sample makes it feel romantic as well as thirsty. Not all the beats have that quality—in an effort to broaden his sound, a few are uncharacteristically generic. I’m thinking of the dancehall-infused “Luv It,” which sounds like a More Life reject, and “Dunk,” a rework of the Soulja Boy anthem that has a little Milwaukee lowend charm but not enough to shed the feeling that it’s played out. I’m surprised that’s not the case more often. Given Cash’s current status as the hottest new thing in New York rap, I half expected PLAY CASH COBAIN to cap off this run by filling out the tracklist with the Travis Scotts and A$AP Rockys (shudder) of the world in chase of a chart-topper. But there’s only a few cases of that in the forgettable megamix “Problem,” and the sterile melodic posse cut “slizzyhunchodon,” with Quavo and Don Toliver. Other than that, it’s just Cash over his own sin city beats, calling out to the same New York friends he always has, daydreaming about all the oral sex he wants to perform. “Sexy drill” may be getting beat into the ground, but when Cash is involved it’s not old yet.",0,"August 23, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cash-cobain-play-cash-cobain/
Monaleo,,5.7,Rap,"Monaleo likes fight music. Kicking ass suits the Houston rapper’s rowdy, swaggering persona, which channels a pro wrestler’s physical might and theatrical libido. Though she doesn’t make outright slab joints, in spirit Monaleo carries the torch for the Texas sub-genre of big sounds and bigger personas. She raps with force, her boasts and punchlines landing like strikes, her outsized confidence beating down your block like a candy-painted swanga. Her debut, Where the Flowers Don’t Die, offered a peek beneath this steely character, pairing her slap-happy revels with schmaltzy R&B and gritty storytelling. She has a strong singing voice, but generally the latter fit better with her She-Hulk raps. The fists she’s so often hurling hit different in the context of her white-knuckle tales of poverty and depression on songs like “Sober Mind” and “Ridgemont Baby.” EP Throwing Bows lacks that ballast. The Monaleo of these chintzy, throwaway songs is a caricature who says anything and fights for nothing. The anger Monaleo constantly invokes is canned and impersonal, more bit than catharsis. That might be fine if her rapping were compelling, but the quality of her writing is inconsistent. From line to line, she will swing from slick and menacing to deeply corny. “I’ll take out her teeth so she can really pop her gums,” she snaps on opener “Drunk Freestyle,” a truly clever bar. But a clunker referencing Spongebob immediately follows: “I’m the one who wear the pants, but I’m not a square.” The record is filled with such momentum-killing wordplay. “Queen and Slime,” a Bonnie and Clyde-style duet with Stunna 4 Vegas, sounds like Tee Grizzley fan fiction. “Ee-er” turns “eater” into a double-entendre for the sound of a squeaky bed but doesn’t feel particularly raunchy as she and Sauce Walka pile on weak puns. “I be twitching when I nut, oh my god, am I a streamer,” Monaleo raps. A lot of her sex songs, which make up about half the record, don’t have any spark. She likes to assert her dominance in bed, but her escapades are pleasureless. One of the strangest lines comes on “Leo Luv the Sluts,” a dull ode to her roster of simps. “Treat a nigga like the bros, I say no homo when we fucking,” she, uh, boasts. I don’t think it’s kink-shaming to call that line stupid. The beats are just as phoned-in. Most of the instrumentals are generic trap fare comprised of 808 kicks here, snares and hi-hats there. A few deviate from the template, but the lack of style and texture persists. “Wam Bam,” a grating facsimile of a Waka Flocka song, is built around a dull flip of Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” “Pimpin’ Ain’t Dead” takes the Beastie Boys sample popularized on Big Tuck’s “Not a Stain On Me” and tosses in tinny drums and a ringtone-quality melody. The overall effect of these canned beats is numbed familiarity, copies of copies of copies. In theory, a wall-to-wall basher should fit right into rap’s current obsession with rage, mosh pits, and grudges. But unlike, say, Rico Nasty’s Anger Management or Playboi Carti’s Whole Lotta Red, Throwing Bows lacks a unifying vision of anger—and one of Monaleo. She’s said she wants to be more than an “aggressive artist,” but feels compelled to keep writing these kinds of songs “because of who I've become in people's lives.” But the songwriting here is so perfunctory that it doesn’t even register as fan service. Monaleo may think she’s pleasing the crowd with all this rah-rah flexing, but from my seat, the fight looks thrown.",0,"September 27, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/monaleo-throwing-bows-ep/
Gillian Welch,Woodland,8.0,Folk/Country,"Woodland, the first collection of original material jointly billed to lifelong collaborators Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, takes its name from the East Nashville studio the pair have owned since 2001. Central to the duo’s creative life, Woodland Studios is where Welch and Rawlings write and record the music they issue under a variety of guises—they’ve only recently started sharing above-the-title credit, after years of alternating between Welch solo affairs and such projects as Dave Rawlings Machine—through their Acony imprint. It was nearly lost in the devastating tornadoes that swept through Nashville in March of 2020, ripping the roof off the studio and forcing Welch and Rawlings to rescue all their master tapes and gear in the middle of the storm. They managed to salvage everything, yet the building itself required extensive repairs, a project that continues to this day. As they rebuilt, Welch and Rawlings continued to create music, first regrouping with All the Good Times (Are Past & Gone), a Grammy-winning collection of folk and country covers cut in their living room, then writing the songs that form Woodland. Names may be fungible in the duo’s universe, but they’re meaningful. Here, the shared billing highlights the way that Welch and Rawlings are intertwined throughout Woodland, acting as one as they sing harmonies and trade leads. The way the pair weave their voices is one of the reasons Woodland doesn’t sound nearly as spartan as albums like 2011’s The Harrow & the Harvest. There’s a palpable warmth to their interplay that extends to the recording itself. Grateful to have their home turf survive, they’ve taken advantage of the full potential of a recording studio. As Welch told Stephen Deusner in Uncut, “We were so relieved that the studio still existed, so we had an amplified desire to really use it.” Hardly a renunciation of the plaintive folk that’s been their signature for years, Woodland does find Welch and Rawlings taking advantage of the possibilities of a recording studio, expanding their austere acoustics with other shades. Some of these colors are nuanced, such as hints of organ and pedal steel that add dimension to vocal harmonies. Other arrangements that announce themselves quite clearly, such as the introduction of a string section or the presence of a rhythm section for the first time on a Welch and Rawlings project since Soul Journey in 2003. The drums and bass don’t provide a thick backbeat but rather a steady pulse, deepening the connection between the duo and their supporting musicians. That intuitive bond between Welch and Rawlings remains at the forefront on Woodland, which does contain plenty of still, quiet moments that feel carved in wood: rustic, weathered, and permanent. This may be familiar ground for Welch & Rawlings yet they still find undiscovered territory within their contours. With its gentle sway and intricate fingerpicking, “The Bells and the Birds” feels unusually delicate, while “Here Stands a Woman” draws an aching portrait of a woman reckoning with the passages of time. “Here Stands a Woman” contains an echo of “Danville Girl,” a folk tune famously played by Woody Guthrie; likewise, “What We Had” has a melody that slightly rhymes with Neil Young’s “Lotta Love,” then drifts into a reassuring ache. In the duo’s hands, the past is always present, even when they prophesize the future. “The Day the Mississippi Died” foretells the day that the river dries up, an apocalyptic vision graced with flashes of humor. Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show plays fiddle on “The Day the Mississippi Died,” weaving his lines through the rambling verses, opening the music up enough to suggest communion among kindred spirits. Secor provides delicate texture, unlike the strings that sweeten “What We Had,” moving the lovely, understated tune toward the province of soft rock. Such sweet, supple sounds are unexpected from Welch and Rawlings, yet they’re not uncommon on Woodland, even though they’re rarely as overt. ""Hashtag,"" an affectionate tribute to Texas troubadour Guy Clark, uses strings and French horns with the skill of an impressionistic painter. Often, the studio craft and arrangements are so refined that they’re felt more than heard; the yearning “North Country” has its melancholy heightened by pedal steel, bass, and drums that whisper. That studio craft, so patient and subtle, gives the album its own distinct character. What sets Woodland apart from the rest of the duo’s remarkable catalog is its quiet adventure and clear empathy, qualities that give the sense that Welch and Rawlings are building a new structure upon an old foundation.",0,"August 22, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gillian-welch-david-rawlings-woodland/
Max Richter,In a Landscape,7.3,Experimental,"Over the last two decades, Max Richter has perfected the art of writing lovely and intimate instrumental music, indebted to Brian Eno, Philip Glass, and Romantic era classical alike. Since the release of his debut Memoryhouse in 2002 and the landmark The Blue Notebooks in 2004, the German-born composer’s brand of tonal, postminimalist composition has dominated the classical scene, with labels like New Amsterdam Records and Bedroom Community championing and furthering the crossover classical ethos. For his part, Richter has basically become a popstar, claiming more than a billion streams to his name and a slew of big-ticket film and television scores. Now, he’s reflecting on these years of music making, looking back to move forward. Released 20 years after The Blue Notebooks, In a Landscape returns Richter to the themes that have made his career with a heavy dose of nostalgia. And while his compositional style functions like a well-oiled machine, In a Landscape shows that there’s still room to evolve by exploring the darkness that churns within his gentle music. Though on its surface Richter’s music is nearly too pretty, it has often been used to soundtrack the ills of society. His film and television scores have served as the backdrop to shows like Black Mirror, while he wrote The Blue Notebooks in protest of the Iraq War. With In a Landscape, he alludes to the polarity of our time and how his lovely music may offer some solace, or space, to contemplate it. But where his other music never strays too far from lightness, here he explores the more melancholy side of his practice, unearthing the uncertainty hiding behind even the most pleasant moments. Throughout, Richter’s melodies slope into downtrodden chords to create a darkened atmosphere. He often starts his compositions with simple phrases of just a few notes that glide down, moving at a leisurely andante and in uneven, unsteady steps. He shrouds each of these plodding phrases with a hint of reverb and ends most of his pieces on a solemn minor chord, languishing in each note. Take opener “They Will Shade Us With Their Wings,” for example, which features a melody in which the second note is accented, not the first, like a long, tired sigh after a sharp breath. This structure gives Richter’s music its pensiveness. “A Colour Field (Holocene)” blossoms from a five-note phrase whose off-kilter motion builds tension with each repetition, creating a hint of dissonance while maintaining his music’s signature charm. “The Poetry of Earth (Geophony)” grows from a couplet of four-note piano melodies, gradually adding in romantic strings that burst and swirl around them. Between these compositions lie recordings of everyday life, like the ambiance of cafes, footsteps, or birds. Though nothing new in the world of field recordings, in the context of In a Landscape, they offer a poignant break to remember the small moments that have already passed. Because Richter’s formula is so honed, it can become difficult to differentiate each piece as the album progresses. Was that the same baroque melody that appeared on “And Some Will Fall,” just transposed? Richter’s approach is almost too cut-and-dry; there’s none of the messiness that comes with processing emotion or the tension and release that defines catharsis. But closer “Movement, Before all Flowers” offers a welcome surprise. The song appears with airiness, turning the album’s leaden minor chords into something buoyant. A cello soars above oscillating piano like a shining light pointing the way back to shore. It’s Richter’s music at its most hopeful, emerging from the wreckage into something even more beautiful.

BIG|BRAVE,A Chaos of Flowers,7.8,Metal,"Over the past decade, Montreal trio BIG|BRAVE have released albums through both Southern Lord and Thrill Jockey, a track record that speaks to their fluency in both bone-shaking doom metal and post-rock experimentation. But their first language was folk music. In the years leading up to their tremorous 2014 debut, Feral Verdure, BIG|BRAVE founders Robin Wattie and Mathieu Ball performed early gigs as an acoustic-oriented duo. Even as they transitioned to electric instrumentation and loaded up on percussive firepower to become one of the most punishing and prolific bands in the contemporary avant-metal landscape, BIG|BRAVE’s emotional core has remained largely intact—in their hands, noise is simply a megaphone to amplify the unrest embedded in their songs from day one. But while their official discography has turned both more expansive and abrasive—culminating in the throat-shredding epics of 2023’s Nature Morte— BIG|BRAVE also took a detour back to their folk-song roots with 2021’s Leaving None But Small Birds, a rustic retreat with Rhode Island metal mutants the Body that was ultimately less Earth than earthy, complete with revamps of dustbowl standards like “Black Is the Color of My True Love’s Hair” and “Once I Had a Sweetheart.” You could say that A Chaos of Flowers is another collaborative archival project that reanimates ancient texts. In this case, the key contributors are summoned from the grave. The majority of tracks on A Chaos of Flowers take their lyrics or inspiration from poets spanning countries, cultures, and eras—from American icon Emily Dickinson to British-Parisian lesbian raconteur Renne Vivien to Japanese proto-feminist Yosano Akiko to Mohawk poet E. Pauline Johnson aka Tekahionwake. (A true tortured poets’ department, as it were.) But they find their point of intersection in Wattie’s identity as a queer woman of mixed heritage living in a bilingual city. If Leaving None But Small Birds journeyed through the past to reconnect with storytelling tradition, then A Chaos of Flowers is more about recontextualizing old wisdom as premonitions of our current condition. As such, the album sounds less like a loud rock band mellowing out than a loud rock band sculpting their squall with all the craft and care of folk music. This isn’t so much doom metal as doomed metal—like 1,000-foot-high sand castles, these songs feel majestic yet ephemeral, as if they could dissolve into the ocean at any moment. In the past, the band might’ve used the sinister riff of “Not Speaking of the Ways” as the foundation for a monstrous march—and the presence of guest guitarist Tashi Dorji and saxophonist Patrick Shiroishi certainly intensifies its nauseous grandeur. But drummer Tasy Hudson lays off the kick pedal and floor tom to tap out a tentative rhythm on her cymbals, allowing the song to float instead of crush. It’s a treatment that perfectly mirrors Akiko’s source verse, a freeze-frame portrait of a love so strong, it has the power to stop time and provide momentary sanctuary. For all of their brute force, BIG|BRAVE’s most powerful weapon has always been Wattie’s voice, whose natural radiance cuts through the sludge to foreground an expressiveness rarely heard in a doom context. On A Chaos of Flowers, she’s not so much trying to overpower the storm as stake out the calm within it. The album’s chilling opener, “I felt a funeral,” is based on Dickinson’s 1861 poem “I felt a funeral, in my brain,” a vivid rumination on the precarity of sanity, depicted here as a showdown between Wattie’s trembling but resolute melody—which suggests a goth-blues spin on “House of the Rising Sun”—and the slow-motion waves of fuzz that threaten to swallow her whole. On the album’s dark, droning centerpiece, “theft,” the dynamic is reversed: As Wattie recites Esther Popel’s namesake poem about an old woman cruelly beaten down by the elements in the dead of winter, her tone almost feels conspiratorial, as if she’s summoning the thick sheets of feedback that close in from all sides. Wattie’s own songwriting contributions feel of a piece with her muses: the ashen-skied ballad “canon: in canon” (featuring the deceptively tranquil fretwork of Thrill Jockey stablemate Marisa Anderson) weaves similar thematic connections between nature, mental health, and survival, while “quotidian : solemnity” reinforces the lyrical focus by doing away with percussion completely to let Wattie’s scabrous soliloquy hover inside a thick thundercloud of distortion. In these meditative moments, BIG|BRAVE boldly stretch their signature sound to its abstract extremes while retaining its doom-metal essence, and in doing so, they affirm that this album’s symbiotic relationship with its predecessor goes beyond a shared floral motif: If Nature Morte was a Richter scale-busting apocalypse of a record, A Chaos of Flowers is the ominous aftershock, an extended reverberation that accrues its own awesome, unsettling force. On the closing interpretation of Tekahionwake’s “Moonset,” Wattie declares, “I may not all your meaning understand/But I have touched your soul in shadow-land.” On A Chaos of Flowers, the heaviness has much to do with the weight of the words as the intensity of the sound.

Billie Eilish,HIT ME HARD AND SOFT,6.8,Pop/R&B,"This is the least we’ve known about Billie Eilish going into an album. For years, the star’s journey was documented in yearly Vanity Fair interviews and candid documentaries; even Carpool Karaoke visited Eilish’s childhood home, where she still lived until recently. That seeming lack of boundaries between the pop star and her audience is increasingly standard for megastars, but Eilish’s intimate music made her a particularly strong candidate for parasociality. Her 2021 album, Happier Than Ever, was largely a response to public scrutiny, more reserved and mature than her 2019 debut, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? In the ensuing years, Eilish kept a low profile, surfacing every now and then to soundtrack a Pixar film or win an Oscar before retreating to work on the next record. To hear Eilish say it, the goal for HIT ME HARD AND SOFT was making an “album-ass album,” citing Coldplay’s Viva La Vida and Vince Staples’ Big Fish Theory as influences. Those records are also ambitious pop mini-epics where established artists show off their range, but there’s usually an outsider like Brian Eno or SOPHIE to get the musician out of their comfort zone. With Finneas once again at the helm, HMHAS is more of the same. For the first time, Eilish’s live drummer Andrew Marshall is on board, as well as the Attacca Quartet, playing arrangements orchestrated by Finneas and the prolific David Campbell. Never one to subscribe to a single genre, Eilish flits from minimalist trance to massive stadium rock, and the album has the same dense vocal layering and inventive percussion that make Finneas one of the most excessively documented producers in pop. But there’s no true swerve, just bigger versions of what they’ve already made—even Coldplay dabbled in shoegaze! What experimentation exists here demonstrates the siblings’ strengths and limitations as they enter their third project together, but it’s diminishing returns. Thematically, HMHAS focuses mostly on falling out of love with a narcissist (as documented on “Blue”) and falling in love with a woman for the first time. Opener “Skinny” teases another record about the perils of fame, in the vein of Happier Than Ever, and it’s hard not to blame her: When Eilish casually confirmed her bisexuality in a larger Variety profile, that’s all the press wanted to talk about. When it’s addressed on the album, it’s on her own terms, as if the years of insensitive “queerbaiting” accusations never happened. It’s hard to stand out in the age of Spotify-sanctioned sapphic playlists, but “Lunch” is delightful for its matter-of-fact sexuality and the record’s best line deliveries: “I bought you something rare/And I left it under… Claire.” Though the syncopated piano and guitar riffs recall the most generic of 2010s alt-pop, Eilish maintains her irreverence with double entendres and zilch-entendres (“I just want to get her off,” she mumbles). The “Last Christmas” chord progression of “Birds of a Feather” feels engineered to soundtrack wistful coming-of-age stories, and sure enough, you’ll find it in the trailer for the wistful coming-of-age Netflix show Heartstopper. Both these songs are uniquely effervescent departures in her catalogue, but they never sound like a pop star playing catchup to pop radio—just the earnest enthusiasm of someone falling in love. Other times Billie and Finneas might as well have switched on a large neon sign that says “this is a masterpiece.” Sometimes that big ambition works: The moody “Chihiro” revisits the uptempo sound of early single “Bellyache” but swaps the acoustic guitars for big, expensive synths, making up for the lack of real chorus with density. Several multi-part suites feel like they’re just retreading familiar territory. Despite a career-best belt from Eilish, “The Greatest” can’t escape the shadow of “Happier Than Ever”; “Bittersuite” devolves from its deep-sea dub intro into “Billie Bossa Nova 2” before timidly segueing to the closer. The nadir is “L’Amour de Ma Vie,” a relatively standard breakup ballad with a second half marred by chintzy synths and production that tries for negative space and comes up empty: After years of reinventing bedroom pop for stadiums, Billie and Finneas finally made something that sounds thrown together in someone’s bedroom. Eilish does stake out new ground in her storytelling, delving into relationship messiness with a newfound maturity. On “Wildflower,” she describes her burgeoning feelings for her current boyfriend’s ex: “You say no one knows you so well/But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt.” The album highlight also thrives on those ambiguous readings: “The Diner” is a stalker song from the point of view of someone breaking into her kitchen, as if one more creepy letter will finally win her heart. Yet lines like “you could be my wife,” out of context, recall the same-sex attraction explored elsewhere; how much of herself does Eilish see in the role of the obsessive romantic? This is, after all, the person who wrote in “Hostage” about wanting to crawl inside her lover’s veins. Text the phone number she whispers in the outro and you’ll get repeated automated texts saying “it’s billie, call me,” drawing a marketing gimmick into the world of the story. Every song on this big album has some detail worth hearing, but the insistence on multipart epics and ballads kills the momentum. When “Wildflower” and “The Greatest” crescendo back to back, it gets aggravating. The much-hyped live instrumentation is more window dressing than it is integral to the artistry, and Jon Castelli’s brightly saturated mix leaves the extraneous elements to fight for space in the more crowded sections. All these enhancements cancel each other out until HMHAS is just another good record from Billie and Finneas—certainly tasteful, and arresting sometimes, but all the session musicians in the world can’t make it a masterpiece.

Sumac,The Healer,8.4,Metal,"From the start, Sumac has welcomed abundance. Singer and guitarist Aaron Turner, an omnivorous multi-disciplinary artist with some 20 musical projects to his name, feeds all of his storied past into his band with drummer Nick Yacyshyn and bassist Brian Cook. When the Pacific Northwest supergroup debuted in 2015 with The Deal, their songs were already knotty hybrids of sludge, hardcore, noise, death metal, and beyond. And each subsequent record has sounded increasingly unsatisfied with keeping pure the tenets of heavy rock’s subgenres. Whether building or deconstructing, Sumac’s open-ended metal continuously seeks to incorporate more and more and more. For all their indulgences, Sumac are veteran musicians in absolute control, whose improvisations are as exact and technically proficient as their dense, circuitous songwriting. This has never been so bluntly apparent as it is on The Healer, the trio’s fifth full-length. Sumac doubles down on everything that made them one of the most fascinating metal bands in recent memory. Grimier chords, longer and weirder freeform jams, utterly confounding rhythms, seismic heaviness, and profound humanity at its core—all sharpened for maximum effect. Their four-song, 76-minute album is a live performance tour de force unique in its dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. But if jaw-dropping musicianship is a given by this point in Sumac’s career, what makes The Healer exceptional is its command of spatial presence and emotional weight. “World of Light” begins its unhinged half hour as an eldritch ooze of drone, low-end rumble, and Turner’s primal rasp. The cracked caterwaul he releases when crying out “Shiiine!” sounds more animalistic than any guttural growl could. About 11 minutes in, the music starts climbing out of the turbulent soup with slow, deliberate steps. It can feel like some kind of cosmic rebirth or spiritual awakening. Yacyshyn and Cook’s brutal rhythm section sometimes drops out completely, leaving Turner’s guitar and Faith Coloccia’s tape noise to cut haunting shapes from the void. Diving head-first into negative space, Sumac builds tension while revealing what hides beneath each onslaught. Often what The Healer reveals is hidden in plain sight. The three main instruments are recorded as if under a microscope, more intensely rendering the physicality of their moment-to-moment vibrations. Bass strings rattle against the fretboard like a chained animal; droning feedback crackles like woodfire; the toggle of guitar switches snap like dried leaves; cymbals burst and glimmer like fractals. The hyper-reality of these peripheral sounds brings a raw psychedelia to the music, which is a rich through line across The Healer. “Yellow Dawn,” full of warbling organ notes and low-slung tom patter, begins with the band’s most explicitly psychedelic arrangement. It carries through the merciless pummeling and origami time signatures to reemerge as an untethered guitar solo that’s as much “Dopesmoker” as it is “Black Hole Sun.” Such recognizable and warmly loved sounds round out the album’s more intricate stretches in a way that galvanizes both. In a year that has seen Knocked Loose going viral on Spotify and Deftones rank among the most popular bands listened to during sex, Sumac has released their least crossover-friendly record yet. The Healer stands in stark contrast to dopamine-drenched metal blasts the length of TikTok videos, like a meditative yet grotesque Jodorowsky film in all of its surreal excess. Epic album closer “The Stone’s Turn” is a mystifying journey, full of starts and stops, whirlwind blast beats, diffuse psych, and electrified riffs that just fucking go. If Love in Shadow searched ever more deeply for metal’s untapped possibilities and May You Be Held confidently wrestled with its roiling unknown, then The Healer swallows its universe whole and reforms it anew. It’s an album that uses the rejection of metal’s well-trodden forms not as an endpoint but as a catalyst for bringing something else into being.

Bladee,Cold Visions,8.3,Rap / Pop/R&B,"“Not many brain cells left, but I’m ready for—” Bladee begins his new album, before he’s cut off by Vincent Price’s famous laugh from “Thriller.” So fried he can’t finish a sentence, this madman’s at the brink of collapse. Seized by panic attacks, he threatens to “kill kill kill” and calls himself “a stupid bitch” while ambulance sirens wail and screams lacerate the night. Ten years in, the Swedish rapper is the most famous he’s ever been and still crippled by anguish. “The only thing that’s left is paranoia,” he cries. Trying to explain Bladee’s bizarre thrill to doubters always felt risky: the more you thought about it, the less sure you were about why you liked him. Here was this young Swede soaking in Auto-Tune and cosplaying as a listless, emo Chief Keef; half the time it was impossible to tell what his verses meant. Still, the twinges of ache in his voice, floating over glassy and gloomy beats, felt inexplicably poignant. His slipshod vocals capture the ennui of modern life like nothing else, or so one long essay put it. Over time, he’s made it easier for true believers and rubberneckers alike, stretching his voice to acrobatic wildness and sculpting a galaxy of surreal lore in the lyrics. Bladee’s version of rap is blemished but beautiful, imperfect and half-coherent in a way that makes banal thoughts feel endearingly askew. Cold Visions is his most realized project to date, an anxious 30-song album that doubles as a chance for him to reflect on his dizzying ascent. It’s enticingly darker than most of what he’s put out in recent years—the sublime optimism of Crest and 333, the summery bounce of Good Luck and The Fool—and more cohesive than Spiderr and Exeter’s freaky experiments. It’s like his life is glitching between dreams and nightmares. He’s at the Gucci store one moment then lying sleepless, begging for help the next; he’s declaring himself the bloodthirsty king then sitting at McDonald’s where all he can muster is calling it the “Sad Meal.” Bladee reaches max mania on “End of the Road Boyz,” which begins with the ear-splitting shrieks of a viral Roblox squeaker that’s like a bouncer for old heads. Flitting between moods, he unleashes a flurry of saintly warbles and baleful mumbles. “Reality surf might break my mind,” he warns. “Take another breath, it’s great, I’m fine.” Everything bursts alive here, from the surround-sound vocals to the production roster that’s basically the cloud-rage Avengers. Seamless transitions make F1LTHY and Warpstr’s synthetic blazes melt against the icy trembles of Lusi, Woesum, Yung Sherman, and Whitearmor. Bladee’s delivery is constantly morphing, hurling horrorcore grunts and evil ASMR whispers over smooth rap flows and the kind of helium-high singing he honed on Crest and The Fool. Demented ad-libs shadow pristine verses; words deform into mutant growls. “King Nothingg” is a killer coronation: Bass thuds convulse, synths shiver, Bladee jokes about trauma-dumping and murdering people for nothing. The mix shakes with demonic sound effects yet somehow ends in a dreamy cloud rap reverie. It’s a far cry from the limp Auto-Tune droning of his early days. Amid the chaos, Bladee pauses to take stock of things with striking lucidity given his usual tendency to abstract and arrive at ideas from oblique angles. He dropped his first solo tape, Gluee, just about a decade ago, back when he was known as Yung Lean’s sidekick. Now at 30, he’s experiencing something like a mid-career crisis. “I got so old, I got embarrassed to even be here, you know?” the intro goes. He’s aware of his immense influence on a new generation of internet musicians, but also feels more personally fucked up and worse off than he was as a fresh-faced 18-year-old. The gorgeously glum “Flatline” conveys Bladee’s sadness about letting someone down—possibly himself?—with some of his most expressive vocals ever, fluttering between hushed murmurs and frail cries; as he repeats how he’s suffocating in “dark feelings,” his tone mirrors the dismay by slowly dropping in pitch. For as agitated as this album can be, it’s also sweetly silly in classic Bladee fashion. “Lows Partlyy” is eerily joyous, its blooming synths juxtaposing wildly with the depressive lyrics lurking beneath. “Burn down the disco, hang the fucking DJ,” Bladee coos at himself, sounding blissed-out. Some lyrics recall the gibberish aphorisms and cutesy riddles of his 2021 Fool era. He talks about “violently drug abusing weed” and accidentally buying 1,000 Smurfs toys while browsing eBay on shrooms. He scorns people for watching YouTube Shorts and says he paints better than Rembrandt. Lines that might feel dead in print electrify the ear through Bladee’s agile vocals, twitching with odd mouth-noises and tone-switches, like how he randomly chirps “I’m back!” as if he’s returning home from work in the twilight haze of “Flexing & Finessing.” While Cold Visions may not be his swan song, there’s definitely a feeling of a closing chapter. The album is haunted by ghosts from Bladee’s past; nearly every song makes some kind of allusion to a previous release. He namedrops track titles like “Everlasting Flames” and “Redlight Moments.” Previously established lore about the mystical Drain Gang High School gets developed more on the snarling “Don’t Wanna Hang Out.” Old audio logos rematerialize, like the “Blade” tag taken from the 1998 movie Blade and the Sad Boys “profound sadness” effect lifted from Street Fighter IV. Veteran drainers are combing through this album in group chats, building a master doc to catalog every interpolation and reference. One minute, Bladee’s wondering whether his cultish fans understand him (“Every time I check the comments I’m thinking like, ‘Do they even deserve me?’”). Later, he doubts whether he’s achieved anything that warrants worship: “The vision is clear, but I’m nowhere near.” It sounds like he’s collected his past lives and sonic memorabilia together for himself as much as for the fans. He’s looking at it all, questioning what his musical accomplishments mean. There’s no clear answer; Bladee hasn’t discovered true happiness or reached enlightenment. By the album’s end, he sounds exhausted yet ecstatic, like he’s shedding a great weight. The music swells and shimmers. “I’m like you, I’m living and I’m learning,” he sings, dissolving into the noise.",1,"April 30, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bladee-cold-visions/
Camila Cabello,"C,XOXO",6.9,Pop/R&B,"Much of the excitement in mainstream pop these days falls left of center. Chappell Roan took us all to theater camp; Charli XCX painted the club green with Brat. It’s only too easy to view Camila Cabello’s recent reboot as the work of a music establishment clumsily shifting gears to follow in their wake. The outsized response sparked by C,XOXO’s lead single “I Luv It” was split between excitement over a radical new musical direction and eye-rolling over what initially seemed like one of the most cynical pop rebrands in recent memory (at least until we figure out what is going on with Katy Perry). It’s too bad, because if there was ever an artist more primed for casting off an old self and giving into some effortless partying, Cabello would be the woman. Until now, her music has been incredibly dutiful, whether owing to the demands of a career in Fifth Harmony or the loving reverence for her musical heritage that shaped her three prior solo albums. Though it bears her signature, C,XOXO is a transitional record mistakenly labeled as a statement album. It’s a bridge away from girl-group polish and Latin-inflected pop and toward a more dreamy and reckless club sound. It is not a full pivot to hyperpop, as “I Luv It” suggested, but more like a stab at the wistful, complex, dancefloor introversion practiced by the likes of Lorde, Kelela, Troye Sivan, Frank Ocean, and Rosalía. It’s an evolution that squares nicely with Cabello’s stated ambition to be thought of not simply as a performer but as a writer, the author of a more complex and explicitly adult narrative than she’s told before. C,XOXO is a broadly sketched tale of returning home to Miami and gaining perspective on broken love and aimless youth. It’s heavy on vibes, evoking the 305 primarily through features, some voice memos, and a toothless Spring Breakers aesthetic that’s notably neither trashy nor violent. Yet the musical landscape that Cabello’s producers El Guincho and Jasper Harris conjure is incredibly vivid, wielding warm synths and babbling samples as slinky launch pads for scorching riffs on Afrobeat and reggaeton. Halfway through the fantastic “Dade County Dreaming”—which doubles as a likely swan song for City Girls—JT’s ass-shaking chant is gradually subsumed by an absolutely tidal piano churn as their swagger gives way to a dreamy instrumental vastness. It’s as if Cabello is accessing a new mental horizon in real time. What horizon is that? If the production has personality to spare, the same cannot always be said of the persona Cabello adopts here. This Camila often feels clumsy, half-drawn, at odds with the assuredness of the music. Even as she professes on “Chanel No. 5” to being “a cute girl with a sick mind,” much of the record bears little evidence of perverse or spontaneous thought. Cabello’s lyrics can be so associative they’re nonsensical. Daisy-chained signifiers like “Cigarette, candy necklace on my hips, butterfly that’s on my wrist” add up to little beyond PG-13 edginess. C,XOXO does powerfully evoke the kind of album Cabello aspires to: A MOTOMAMI, Blonde, or Something to Give Each Other, the kind of record that reveals itself through collage, expertly weaving in loose strands that telegraph the artist’s taste and sensibility. Apart from a few wonderfully insane moments like the Gucci Mane sample on “I Luv It” or the downcast Pitbull rework of “B.O.A.T.,” Cabello’s choices more often feel either random or convenient. When she gives an unexpected shout-out to Haruki Murakami on “Chanel No. 5,” it feels like posturing. It doesn’t help that it’s made to slot into such a basic, and vaguely orientalist, rhyme scheme: “Fold for me like origami/Magic and real like Murakami/Red chipped nails, I’m wabi-sabi.” Her features are a mixed bag in the same way. Her sultry, steely-eyed vocals on “Dade County Dreaming” make for a cool compliment to JT and Yung Miami’s staccato flows; her voice maps sweetly onto PinkPantheress’ effervescent production on the too-short “pink xoxo.” But there’s little chemistry with Playboi Carti, who’s left muttering to himself on the frenetic, overblown “I Luv It,” and Cabello’s coyness is mismatched against Lil Nas X’s full-throated horniness on “He Knows.” That her Drake duet, “Hot Uptown,” arrives on the back of his bruising defeat to Kendrick Lamar is a miracle of bad timing, because it’s excellent: a should-be hit that plays brilliantly to their respective strengths as a songwriter and a fuckboy. Cabello is so eager to go searching for new sounds you occasionally wonder if she ought to be crediting other artists for the raw material she’s working with. Even though she’s decidedly Lana-endorsed, “June Gloom” cribs a little too much from the singer’s laconic flow for comfort; ditto Amaarae on “He Knows,” which fits a little too neatly into her sweaty, eclectic vision of Afrobeat. It still feels almost psychedelic how in-your-face the Charli XCX rip is on “I Luv It,” especially in light of the album’s title. Cabello has the juice to be her own artist and is more than capable as a writer, but the risks she takes are inherently safe when they’ve all been taken before. Her best songs on C,XOXO capture an acute emotional drift with a compelling honesty. “B.O.A.T.” is gorgeous, a song that pines for the final word in a breakup that she’ll never get to utter. Cabello tracks her roiling emotions in real time as her voice leaps from Auto-Tuned lament to piercing anger, while a subtle sample of Pitbull’s “Hotel Room” needles its way through, half-mocking, half-longing. It’s sad, sophisticated, and utterly singular—a proof of concept in a room full of prototypes. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Joe Goddard,Harmonics,6.9,Electronic,"Feeling down? Weary? Out of sorts? Hot Chip’s Joe Goddard has got you covered on Harmonics, the London producer’s third solo album and a record so relentlessly empathetic it can feel like getting smothered by a pack of golden retrievers. Goddard has history here. Hot Chip, the group he co-founded with Alexis Taylor, are known for their arm-around-the-shoulder melodies, while his project the 2 Bears, with Raf Rundell, once released the charming “Bear Hug,” a song that literally promised to take you in its arms. Goddard’s 2011 single “Gabriel,” meanwhile, is such a beautifully rendered, deeply felt pop-house song that it almost managed to escape from the charred emotional void at the core of VULTURES 1’ “Beg Forgiveness,” where Ye flipped its chorus into a defense of Chris Brown, of all people. But Harmonics really is a festival of warmth, from its cordial name down. Goddard designed the record, he says, to be “loving, romantic - and fun,” and this approach extended into Harmonics’ production; Goddard tried not to force meaning onto the music or his collaborators. Certainly, it all sounds very welcoming: The beats largely bounce along at an inclusive 125-ish BPM as the music takes a soothing stroll through the dance styles that have long dominated Goddard’s work, namely house, garage (both UK and U.S.), funk, and soul. The synths shine persistently bright and a stream of guest vocalists pour their hearts out on songs that are heavy on tales of romantic intrigue. Still, Harmonics isn’t really a happy album—more a wistful one, with a deep strain of “chin up mate” encouragement. Goddard’s melodies tend toward the doleful, and an understated melancholy runs through Harmonics like late-summer nostalgia. Sure, there is romance, but we are far from the happily ever after. “Why do we love then in this world/Why must we try again, hurt ourselves,” Goddard ponders on “Follow You,” a vaguely gothic rock-soul number. The album’s guests don’t sound in much better humor: “Deep inside I know just what to do/But how do I find healing in the song?” Milan-based singer-songwriter Fiorious croons on the gospel house of “New World (Flow)”. This melancholy dance format produces some beautiful moments. “On My Mind” is the kind of ruminative 2-step that Jamie xx wishes he could achieve, while “Summon,” with former Wild Beast Hayden Thorpe, is a Larry Heard-esque fantasy of deep-house beats and disco introspection. At times, though, the relentless march of default mode boom-tish house and bittersweet synth melodies gets a little stifling—less comforting than simply comfort zone. What’s frustrating is that there is a more adventurous album trying to escape from beneath Harmonics’ house-y shroud, one where Goddard’s more intrepid collaborators really take the lead. “Miles Away,” with Guinean vocalist Falle Nioke, and “Progress,” with Ibibio Sound Machine, both touch on Afro-house; “When Love’s Out of Fashion,” with British rapper Oranje, detours into hip-hop; and “Revery,” with Alabaster DePlume, has a touch of Underground Resistance-style space jazz to its saxophone groove. That these are among the best songs on the record is no coincidence. Goddard’s compassionate attitude is a welcome antidote to our divided world, and it does often bear fruit. But little truly great art is made by committee. Harmonics’ collection of relatable songs and interesting ideas could use a stronger hand on the tiller to reach its intended destination.

Various Artists,Even the Forest Hums: Ukrainian Sonic Archives 1971-1996,8.3,,"If you were a Cold War kid, growing in the sunset of the Reagan years, what did you know about Ukraine? Maybe you knew about the reactor in Chernobyl that irradiated half of Europe, and that scene in Seinfeld where the fur-hat-wearing Ukrainian smashes Kramer and Newman’s game of Risk! on the subway (“You not say Ukraine weak!”). Maybe you saw, in the 1994 Olympics, Nancy Kerrigan finish second to Oksana Baiul, a waifish orphan turned figure skater who came from that newly independent ex-Soviet country. If you were born an American millennial, did you hear about the Ukrainian revolutions? There was the Orange Revolution in 2004, and the Maidan Revolution in 2013. Did you know what all those massive crowds of Ukrainian citizens were protesting for, or against? Now we all know more about Ukraine—but Russia’s brutal full-scale invasion of 2022 has flattened it again, into a site of ongoing tragedy and/or wartime resilience. If you, like me, have been paying close attention to Ukraine for years, you have been sick with worry over the damage and loss of this unjust war, over the existential threat it poses to this place, but also over the ways it has again reduced Ukraine to a collection of stereotypes and catastrophe. All of which is why the new, lovingly curated collection titled Even the Forest Hums: Ukrainian Sonic Archives 1971-1996 arrives as both a sonic balm and a reminder that Ukraine is not merely some liminal backwater. The ambition of this musical anthology is vast: to recuperate, rehabilitate, and celebrate experiments in Ukrainian popular music in their full and wild complexity. A collaboration between the indispensable crate diggers behind Shukai (meaning “to hunt, or search”), a reissue label founded in Kyiv in 2018, and Seattle’s Light in the Attic, the anthology gathers lesser-known works by Ukrainian musicians who operated in the murky spaces between official and unofficial culture in the last decades of the Soviet Union. The liner notes, written by veteran music journalist and tireless Kyiv-based impresario Vitalii “Bard” Bardetskyi, emphasize the power of music over the vicissitudes of a Ukrainian history marked by Russian imperial repression, Stalinist famine, war, mass population transfers, and the ebb and flow of Kremlin laws restricting or criminalizing expressions of Ukrainian language, faith, and music. Bardetskyi, in addition to co-owning Kyiv’s hip audiophile bar and record store GRAM, wrote the script for the 2020 documentary Mustache Funk, which narrated the history of Ukrainian pop in the ’70s with the sensitivity evident in the liner notes for this anthology. In Bardetskyi’s narrative of late Soviet to post-Soviet Ukraine, no musician is shamed for their participation in the culture of Soviet officialdom. No one is accused of selling out if they played in a VIA (“Vocal Instrumental Ensemble,” the bloodless bureaucratic Soviet term for what we would otherwise recognize as buttoned-up rock’n’roll). Instead, Bardetskyi offers a redemptive storyline for ex-Soviet citizens, pointing out how Ukrainian musicians managed to write catchy and sometimes profound songs even within the restrictions set by the state. And, as Mustache Funk emphasized, they often did it with a lot of luxurious facial hair. The images that accompany the attractive vinyl package for Even the Forest Hums are taken from Maria Prymachenko, Ukraine’s most celebrated “naive” artist. The cover image is the 1982 anti-war painting known by the title A Dove Has Spread Her Wings and Asks for Peace; the back cover features 1978’s May That Nuclear War Be Cursed! Prymachenko, whose home museum outside of Kyiv was destroyed in the first days of Russia’s full-scale invasion, has become an icon of Ukrainian resilience in recent years. Prymachenko is an example of an artist whose bold experimentation—sometimes championed by Soviet art critics, sometimes repressed—has been integrated into the complex inheritances of contemporary Ukrainian society. This attempt at integrating a messy history is reflected in some of the musical choices, too. “Oh, Get Ready, Cossack, There Will Be a March,” from the lost tape of the Shapoval Sextet’s live performance at the 1976 Donetsk Jazz Festival—which was originally found and then released by Shukai in 2020, and features the unique timbre of a Soviet electronic organ—transmutes an anti-imperial and centuries-old Ukrainian epic song into, as Bardetskyi says, “true spiritual jazz” reminiscent of Pharoah Sanders’ Karma or John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme. There are plenty of revelations here. Ihor Tsymbrovsky’s ethereal falsetto in “Beatrice” (1996), set against a piano both campy and plodding, is haunting. But the biggest surprises in this anthology come from the women whose careers Shukai has helped to recover in recent years. The “sound mantra” of Valentina Goncharova’s “Silence” (1989), composed of reverberant bell tones that echo, fall, and weave into occasional ocarina-like whistles, suggests the repetitive gestures of New York electronic minimalism. The understated sexiness of Svitlana Nianio’s “Episode III” (1994), with its hypnotic vocal melody, reminded me of Nico, had she sung an octave higher. Nianio, a member of late-’80s Kyiv underground darlings Cukor Bila Smert (Sugar White Death), is also featured in a song from a 1990 cassette that demonstrates some of the fetish for East Asian mysticism and Slavic folklore that flourished in the youth subcultures of the late Soviet period. Overall, the curatorial taste tends towards the atmospheric. If you came looking for bangers, you might find yourself instead seated on the dancefloor, swaying to the cyclical hippie rhythms of Er. Jazz (short for “Erotic Jazz”) and the recurring flavor of flute solos. The audacious task of trying to capture a quarter-century’s worth of a country’s lesser-known musical output in one anthology means that completists might contest some selections and gaps. The two-chord jam of “Yarn” (1992), despite its use of folk hammered dulcimer, is repetitive; the ambient track “Barreras,” from Spanish-born Ukrainian diaspora musician Iury Lech, slows the pace. Uksusnik, meaning “vinegar,” was the first teenaged band of Eugene Hütz, who grew up in Kyiv’s Obolon’ district (the “Bronx of Kyiv”) before coming to the U.S. and making a splash with the Slavic punk band Gogol Bordello. Uksusnik’s song “North Wind” embodies the sound of a band’s tender first attempts to make rock’n’roll; the track appears on CD and digital releases but couldn’t be included on the vinyl release due to format constraints. Such small discrepancies between the tracklisting on vinyl and CD, and annotations in the liner notes, can make for an occasionally confusing listening experience. But the broad sweep of the anthology—from state-sanctioned folk-rock to disco, exotica, musique concrete, and jazz in many guises—offers a breathtaking introduction to Ukrainian music’s scope and diversity. Logics of the Cold War often parsed the world into opposing categories. The evil empire was over there; the good empire, I guess, was over here. Multihued, uninhibited artists taking risks here; grayscale, top-down stylized culture there—or, perhaps, underground subversive stuff so threatening to power that it actually toppled the USSR. But of course it was never that simple. As this remarkable archival dive shows, even the Ukrainian musicians who became famous for recordings of highly regulated, state-sanctioned pop, released on the monopolistic Soviet record label, were also freaking out at jazz festivals that were never supposed to be recorded for public consumption. As the legendary Ukrainian musician Sashko Pipa once told me in an interview for Tantsi, a book I wrote about the first Ukrainian punk band, even when things were bleak or bleaker, musicians in Ukraine have found ways to make the music they wanted to hear. This anthology’s rare and eclectic songs refute convenient stereotypes and ought to remind us not to get too complacent about music’s strange power. Even slow, shimmery songs can be defiant. Even ostensibly apolitical dance music is a reminder of the people who made that music, people who refused to be silenced and dehumanized by the unfair circumstances of their place in the world.

AraabMuzik,AGGRO DR1FT (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),7.6,Electronic,"It’s the end of the world, and everyone is fighting for loot drops. The chorister singing the requiem is Harmony Korine, who since Gummo has found increasingly kaleidoscopic ways to depict the beauty and horror of a society eating itself. If Spring Breakers vaulted his perverse visions into the mainstream bacchanal of red Solo cups and multi-floor EDM ragers, his latest film flips the script for a more isolated age. AGGRO DR1FT, shot entirely in eye-dilating thermal vision, is a nightmare of few words: Miami assassins hunt each other down, praying for an end to the violence as motion-capture demons haunt the skies above them. Cartoonish side characters dispense assignments with the mechanical exaggeration of Grand Theft Auto NPCs. Pole dancers spark firecrackers up and down their bodies while dissolving into a quagmire of robotic A.I. slush. Travis Scott shows up. Either you’ll think the whole thing is mind-numbingly tasteless, or you’ll find a sick truth in its garish absurdity. AraabMuzik’s voided-out score is key to the film’s hypebeast ego-death aura. Tapping the Rhode Island producer for a project like this may seem like a throwback—he hasn’t really seen the spotlight since his days sharing festival billings with Zedd and Clams Casino (even if his trance-meets-trap 2011 debut, Electronic Dream, still sounds as euphoric as ever). But listening to his music for AGGRO DR1FT, it’s hard to fathom that he and Korine didn’t link up sooner. AraabMuzik’s bottle-service transcendence clearly inhabits the same universe as Spring Breakers, a molly-fueled fantasy reaching longingly toward the heavens. Rather than sliding his usual rapidfire MPC finger drumming into the picture, however, AraabMuzik ventures into new realms, luxuriating in a pure synth soundscape that renders Korine’s dystopian hellworld one tone at a time. Drawing on the language of gaming and experimental film, AGGRO DR1FT deals mainly in impressionistic texture (it has more in common with one of Phil Solomon’s PlayStation elegies than the shoot-em-ups it pretends to be). AraabMuzik’s soundtrack similarly hits on the most basic sensory levels. Apparently texted to Korine in bits and pieces without seeing the movie, AraabMuzik’s score is collected as a series of loops often lasting a minute or less, alongside a handful of slightly longer tracks that take more room to stretch their legs. In the film, Korine slows these snippets down, speeds them up, and stretches them out until they glow like magma. Perusing them all at once creates the same sensation as scrolling through levels on a mission select screen. Color is Korine’s primary weapon in AGGRO DR1FT, and AraabMuzik’s lush sketches provide deeper pigmentation to his infrared hallucinations. “The Summoning” sets the scene with morbid laser-beam synths that hover in a threatening mist; “17th Symphony” moves queasily between blurry pianos and aching chords, warbling like a ghost drifting through a graveyard. The gothic grandiosity of AraabMuzik’s church organs and bitcrushed Gregorian chants charges the madness onscreen with a bizarre sense of consequence. In one scene, the crackling loop of “The Abyss” circles round as our main assassin is telepathically tormented by a winged psychopath, imbuing the monster’s cries of “Why can’t you kill me?” with doomed gravitas. Though AraabMuzik’s trance-y temperament contributes to the film’s clubby milieu, he pulls from far outside his wheelhouse to establish AGGRO DR1FT’s apocalyptically surreal environment. “En Route” slithers through a subterranean march that’s equal parts Jon Hassell and Lustmord, and “The Beloved” lifts everything skyward as he draws out a Constance Demby-worthy new-age drone (complete with angelic choir). The longer tracks, in particular, benefit from having time to sink deeper into the muck: The swelling brass of “The Apex” simmers with a science-fiction military suspense straight out of Metal Gear Solid, while “Theory,” with its alien sound design and distant, clanging percussion, captures an eerie tunneling feeling that anyone who’s gotten lost playing Metroid will know all too well. Harmony Korine has built a formidable body of work out of playing in the garbage. You’d be hard-pressed to find another director with the audacity to premiere their film in a strip club, then follow it up by announcing a first-person thriller about baby-headed home invaders (with Burial supplying the soundtrack, no less). Testosterone is at war with itself in Korine’s movies, but he avoids coming off like a complete chud by knowing when and how to embrace sincerity. That’s where AraabMuzik’s lavish music comes in—not only fleshing out AGGRO DR1FT’s otherworldly tableau, but humanizing its emotions. When “King’s Arrival” appears in a late scene, it soundtracks our main assassin shooting a man in the head, who mutters as he bleeds out, “You fucking got me.” It might seem like mere video-game logic: murder taken to the point where even a victim can only shrug, as if they’d just been tagged ‘it.’ But when the hitman takes yet another life, his next target seems more crestfallen, whispering as they die, “I’ll see you in the next life.” AraabMuzik’s searing, funereal chants swirl in horror, turning what might otherwise look like nihilism into something more like a prayer for a way out.",0,"August 7, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/araabmuzik-aggro-dr1ft-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/
Nala Sinephro,Endlessness,8.5,Jazz / Experimental,"Endlessness, Nala Sinephro’s second record, centers on an arpeggio. The London-based composer modulates this ascendant phrase, extends it, plays it more lento, and lets it slip into inaudibility and disappear. It carries us like a rip tide through the album’s 10 tracks, all called “Continuum”—a perfect name for each, though this LP isn’t a series of variations on a single composition. Listen closely, and its details transform at a relentless clip. Let your mind drift, and its 45 minutes resemble a lake: broad, serene, consistent if never flat. The 28-year-old, raised on the outskirts of Brussels by a Belgian mother and a father with roots in Martinique and Guadeloupe, has both ambient music’s cool breeze and jazz’s strong winds at her back. She emerged as the union of these genres was finally losing its hyphen, during the COVID-marooned days of 2021. Floating Points and Pharoah Sanders’ Promises arrived in March, an event that paired the electronic perfectionist on the same bill as the elder-statesman saxophonist, along with the London Symphony Orchestra. Sinephro’s sparkling debut, Space 1.8, dropped in September of the same year, as though she knew a mantle was waiting to be taken up. She had recorded the disc in 2018 and 2019, but that only made her arrival more uncanny—when was the last time that a couple of jazz records, put out mere months apart, seemed to be talking to each other, disagreeing, finding common ground, and cogitating over a future for the form? Still, Sinephro scopes out the frontier. Endlessness dissolves the binaries that define ambient jazz and imagines a third sort of music that thrives at their midpoint. Its seamlessness distinguishes Sinephro’s second album from its still excellent predecessor, which was alternately atmospheric and bluesy. This is more cohesive, more elegant. Endlessness merges sensibilities with the naturalness of DNA strands bonding into a double helix. It both proves ambient jazz’s endurance and renders the two terms mutually redundant. Sinephro has grown considerably as a studio brain and bandleader in the last five years. She produced and mixed every song on Endlessness, engineering them with collaborator Rick David. She also arranged all of the record’s strings—never saccharine or maudlin, they feel poignant and as judicious as any other instrumental feature. Sinephro plays harp, piano, and synths both modular and otherwise alongside a who’s who of friends from South London’s jazz scene. Endlessness’ soul is the energy of the session, the ability of musicians in a room to swap ideas in real time. The work begins with a tight combo clocking in: Sinephro signals the start with multiple synth parts, Black Midi’s Morgan Simpson adds his drums, and Ezra Collective’s James Mollison jumps in on saxophone. The bandstand expands on the next cut—Endlessness feels auteur-ish thanks not only to Sinephro’s masterminding, but because musicians constantly replace each other, slipping like samples through her deft production. Lyle Barton accompanies on synth, offering a whorling lead part on “Continuum 3”; UK torchbearer Nubya Garcia’s sax sets a spark as “Continuum 5” turns to “Continuum 6”; Dwayne Kilvington lays down sparing synth bass, stabilizing an LP that nearly entirely forgoes any four-stringed foundation; Natcyet Wakili, known for his timekeeping with Sons of Kemet, subs in on percussion; Sheila Maurice-Gray purrs away on flugelhorn and trumpet. Endlessness’ pristine exterior hardly conceals the generative buzz of Sinephro’s players, who give the collection both breadth and persistent gusts of fresh air. Her easy-come-easy-go ensemble labors against the composer’s production like swimmers battling a current. The pulse she offers at the start soon becomes an invitation to challenge its boundaries. Simpson’s tumbling drumwork rejects the arpeggio only minutes into “Continuum 1,” taking control of duration, stretching it like putty, before he passes it back to Sinephro and the track reorients itself. Meanwhile, synthesizers pluck away like Sinephro’s own harp. The concoction eventually reduces to a sax line so intimate and unadorned that you can hear the pads clack against the brass. Elsewhere, Sinephro reroutes the pulse herself. “Continuum 7” shifts momentum when she slows the arpeggio, transposes it, and buttresses the ostinato with a descending response to its call. For a glorious moment, we’re suspended as though inside of our own vascular systems, watching as little particles of modular synth and chordophone float by us. The drums lock into the central groove again midway through “Continuum 8” and the group hits its stride, loping forth in jaunty lockstep. Orchestration blows open the music’s sense of space. “Continuum 2” is a simmering jam turned strange when a noise emanates like vintage technology trying to mimic the sound of a deflating balloon. Then the band loosens, the strings well up; Sinephro’s harp later trickles to the fore, a trip from delicate to robust and back that lingers long after Endlessness concludes. Even when the strings seem to accent the arrangements, as on “Continuum 3,” they move with melodic purpose, their entrances and exits dramatic and without emotional prescription. Endlessness invites us to feel but never tells us what our feelings should be. The LP has the potential to be a relaxed listen if you welcome this side of its personality, but it’s also vast and complicated. In the dwindling seconds of “Continuum 9,” Mollison sounds a strained note from his tenor. The gesture is fleeting, succinct, and speaks at once to the album’s epic scale and sense of understatement. Sinephro’s music threads a needle between idioms; she makes a garment that both flows with the force of gravity and combats its weight. Endlessness is more than a crafty marvel, or even than the sum of its vaunted parts. It feels like a feat of physics. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

µ-Ziq,Grush,7.6,Electronic,"For a style ostensibly rooted in club culture, IDM has long felt like the concerned frown on the face of electronic music: a place where gnarled experimentation trumps whimsical adventure and fun is sacrificed on the altar of technique. Enter Mike Paradinas, a producer who was making leftfield dance music when Selected Ambient Works 85-92 was a new release, rather than a dusty classic. Grush, Paradinas’ 17th solo album as µ-Ziq, strives to put the “dance” back into IDM, inspired by the kind of melodic, oddball post-rave music that gave rise to the genre back in the 1990s: Aphex Twin, early Autechre, Black Dog Productions, and even Orbital. Given that self-appointed mission, Grush could easily have been a nostalgic stroll through the glory days of the ’90s, when Paradinas was feted as one of the hottest names in electronic music. Anyone who loves Aphex Twin’s Hangable Auto Bulb EPs or Paradinas’ own 1997 album Lunatic Harness will find much to love in Grush’s vibrant melodies and intricately funky rhythms. “Fogou” is a glorious combination of driving, neo-classical synth and glitched-out drums; the pounding “Reticulum B” has the distinct air of Sabres of Paradise’s wobbly-lipped, cerebral techno classic “Smokebelch II”; and “Manscape” sounds like Orbital's “Belfast” being dissected by sharply angled breaks. The difference here—and it can be subtle—is that the drums on Grush frequently sound like they were recorded live, which is unusual for the breaks- and drum-machine-heavy world of IDM. They weren’t, but the intention is there: The tambourine on “Fogou” and “Belvedere” consists of single hits, programmed slightly out of time to simulate real playing, while the shuffling snare and hi-hat pattern on “Hyper Daddy” bears a similarly human sense of flux. “Hyper Daddy,” which Paradinas created specifically to play live, is the song where the producer’s focus on dance is most obvious: Three different drum lines tease, fidget, and needle with the listener’s adrenal response. Grush’s predictably excellent drums are the mark of a producer who has been cutting up breaks for decades. But perhaps the most purely enjoyable part of the record lies in its array of sumptuous melodies, which evoke the classical prog of Tangerine Dream, Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells, or even, gulp, Marillion. At least two of Grush’s 14 tracks, “Hyper Daddy” and “Hastings,” have artful key changes that lend a very prog-ish musicality to proceedings, and immaculately clean keyboard lines send the listener back to the hi-fi-enhanced stereoscopic sound of the ’70s. If much of Grush feels like an ode to the golden years of IDM, a few more adventurous songs serve as a reminder of Paradinas’ enduring interest in mold-breaking sounds. (His label Planet Mu was one of the first to bring Chicago footwork to an international audience.) The dazzling “Metaphonk” smuggles a dembow beat into a stately, Orbital-esque post-rave workout, while the scuttling hi-hat patterns on “Imperial Crescent” point towards trap. For all of Paradinas’ invention and melodic skills, Grush is unlikely to revolutionize IDM. The record’s innovations are modestly hidden in clever programming, while Paradinas himself is too level-headed to inspire Aphex Twin-style devotion. But he does make a compelling case for the genre as a living entity that’s open to new ideas, and not nearly as persnickety as its reputation suggests.",0,"June 20, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/u-ziq-grush/
Asher White,Home Constellation Study,8.0,Rock,"A few details to get out of the way up front. Home Constellation Study is Asher White’s 15th album, though the actual number of releases on her Bandcamp, which includes various side projects and non-album collections, is 26. The earliest of these, a ghostly collage of feedback and field recordings of Icelandic landscapes, came out when the Providence musician was 14 years old. She is now 24. White’s prodigious early years may help to explain the accomplishment and imagination of Home Constellation Study, an album whose abundance of ideas might seem excessive if it weren’t so carefully arranged. One song sounds like Radiohead with periodic interruptions from Lightning Bolt, another like Burt Bacharach by way of Jim O’Rourke, a third like a Gamble & Huff symphonic soul epic downsized to the scale of a basement rehearsal room. A partial list of instruments that White played includes guitar, bass, drums, banjo, glockenspiel, granular synthesis, piano, and “fake mellotron”—nearly everything on the album, save for some horns and additional electronics. White clearly loves pop and outré music from many eras. The period that Home Constellation Study most directly recalls is the one just before she started uploading her work: the mid-to-late 2000s, a time when indie rock held accessibility and experimentation in delicate balance, when a bruising noise-rock band might share a bill with a psych-folk collective that seemed sort of like a cult, when DIY scenes had just enough attention to feed bands’ ambition—but not yet so much that they crumbled under the pressure or cleaned up their acts and signed to majors. And though White wrote and recorded Home Constellation Study primarily by herself, it feels distinctly social, in an embodied, in-person, perhaps old-fashioned sort of way. So much music from young songwriters and producers now evokes the solitary overstimulation and context collapse of hours spent online. White’s feels more like hitting the road with a friend, making impromptu stops, laughing together, getting into arguments whose stakes are not hidden behind screens, then talking it out and hitting the road again. Home Constellation Study begins in transit, with “Theme From Leaving Philadelphia,” a travelogue that a less adventurous arranger might have set to simple acoustic guitar or piano, for maximum directness and authenticity. Instead, White opts for sounds that reflect the wonder and frenzy of her departure. First, there is a fanfare of horns, voices, and maybe fake mellotron that recalls Aaron Copland’s hymns to the American spirit more than it does indie rock. Then the drums come in with a groove like a runaway train. There’s an acoustic guitar somewhere deep in the mix, strumming so hard and fast I can’t help but worry about carpal tunnel. Asa Turok’s trombone and Addy Schuetz’s sax bob and weave, sometimes offering lyrical countermelodies and sometimes terse punctuation. Cowbells clang like only cowbells can. White sings as if at a comfortable remove from the frenzy, tracing exuberant spirals of melody, unbothered by the rushing noise on the other side of the train window. The rhythms of the words neatly fit the hairpin turns of the tune; impressions of inner feeling and outer landscape begin to blur in her imagistic lyrics. One line returns persistently, nagging as it might have nagged the hungover passenger as she wrote: “I am still drunk!” One gets the sense that White is not satisfied with a song until each of its constituent parts has been turned over and considered from all possible angles for potential adjustments that might make it somehow stranger and more familiar at once. Each time the wonky guitar hook to “Runes” repeats, it is one beat longer or shorter than the previous version, a change that doesn’t at first register on the conscious level beyond a vague sense of unsettlement. “Slow Wheel of the Year,” whose guitar-and-voice arrangement is the album’s sparest and most straightforward, has percussion breaks that sound like the lazy clicking and whirring of a bicycle’s gears as its rider coasts downhill. These idiosyncrasies are almost always in service to the effect of a song as a whole. In the case of “Slow Wheel of the Year,” the unusual instrumentation illustrates the title and the words; in “Dream Design House,” the verse’s underlying rhythm subtly shifts to accommodate White’s vocal phrasing, using time-signature changes to make the music smoother and more natural rather than ostentatiously jagged in the manner of math rock. The printed lyrics to the gorgeous and cautiously optimistic love song “Capital Cowboy” contain a reference to Steely Dan that doesn’t actually appear in the final recording, an easter egg or version-history error that is revealing in some small but significant way: Though White’s music sounds almost nothing like the Dan on its surface, you can see how she might relate to their famous fastidiousness. White’s preference for poetic formalism and non-narrative imagery also sets her apart from her generational peers. A line might move you not for what it reveals about Asher White as a person, or the way it makes her more relatable to you as a listener, but for the exquisite way its syllables and phonemes drape across the melody. Her interest in the musical possibilities of language can make the songs tough to parse for literal meaning, but it also makes them emotionally supple, adaptable to whatever the listener might bring. “Downstate Prairie” is apparently about city-dwellers who fetishize the idea of simple rural existence. The lines that stick with me come after most of the instruments fall away—banjo, churning drums, skronky free-jazz sax, enormous slabs of guitar distortion—leaving only White’s voice and a few bare chords: “No more borrowing the trouser and the collar and the boot/No more visiting the orchard and absconding with the fruit/Hand in hand.” You can see how they relate to the idea of urban hipsters stealing valor from country folks, but in context, for me, they sound more like a last look at love gone by, at days spent breaking rules and wearing each other’s clothes. White writes challenging melodies for herself to sing, and pulls them off with low-key sprezzatura, never at pains to show off their difficulty. Her inflections color the words with feeling beyond whatever might be grasped on the page alone. There is a world of rich contradiction in the way she breathes the word “photograph,” in “Capital Cowboy”: on the one hand, longing for reassurance; on the other, radiating self-possession that requires no such outside validation for sustenance. Her human presence as a singer helps to hold Home Constellation Study’s divergent strains together, and to keep the album from ever coming across like an exercise in music-school intellectualism, no matter how elaborate its underpinnings. White may have had a sizeable head start on many of her peers in learning how to put a record together, but as a character in her own songs, she’s just like any other young American: high on romance and danger, restless in love and ideas, unsure of herself and the world, determined to figure it all out.",0,"July 8, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/asher-white-home-constellation-study/
Shinichi Atobe,,7.5,Electronic,"Shinichi Atobe’s 2001 debut EP, Ship-Scope, and its much-belated follow-up, 2014’s Butterfly Effect, epitomize dub techno at its eeriest and most grime-encrusted. Even when the producer pivoted toward an increasingly melodic house sound following 2018’s Heat, his music never lost its creepy edge. The ingredients are there for a good time, but accompanied by a dreadful thrum of anticipation, a vague sense that the sea breeze is blowing tropical disease in your direction. Most disconcertingly, there never seem to be any people in the places his music evokes. For a while, Atobe made an effort to make himself nonexistent, fueling conspiracy theories about his identity. He rarely performs live, only a few photos of the man exist, and he gave his first interview this year. (He claims that he’s not really a recluse—simply that no one bothered to reach out.) Atobe’s surprise new EP Peace of Mind revels in some of the prickliest sounds to appear on an Atobe release since 2016’s cryptic, static-drenched World. Across five tracks, including the aptly named download-only “Bonus Track,” Peace of Mind never coheres like the four-chord epics that have become hallmarks of Atobe’s releases. It retains its dissonant and searching tone throughout, with synth melodies sticking out at right angles to the chords behind them; only the effervescent “Bonus Track” is unscathed by the pall that hangs over the record, but it bounces off into the distance after only three minutes, ending the EP in just under half an hour. There aren’t many sounds on Peace of Mind that you couldn’t find on a house record in 1992, but Atobe deploys his limited palette in striking and suspenseful ways. The tinny horn synth on “Saxophone and Bass” buzzes like an errant hornet, and the acid squelch on “Out” is less a bassline than a spiky melodic diddle. Like Moodymann, he creates a purgatorial sense of unease by pairing basslines, chords, and melodies in different keys, as if they’ve been Frankensteined together from disparate songs he had lying around with no conscious regard to how they might fit. Unlike Moodymann, whose music is often perfumed with sampled club audio and convivial glass-clinks, Atobe’s music is allergic to voices. A sampled diva or a funk-break “whoo” would sound as out of place here as it would on a Bach fugue. The centerpiece and highlight of Peace of Mind is “Rain 6,” one of Atobe’s most abstract immersions into pure sound design, with eerie digital raindrops and reluctant flecks of bass circling a sour, swooning synth chord. Atobe’s music is atmospheric, but it’s rarely “ambient,” and “Rain 6” proves he can thrive in a beatless context without compromising his essential weirdness. Atobe likes to scatter numerical series of tracks out of order across his albums, and “Rain 6” follows up “Rain 3,” from 2020’s Yes, which would be a fairly conventional trop-house banger if not for the spaghettified marimba every few bars. The two tracks would seem to have nothing in common, but Peace of Mind proceeds from such curious logic that “Rain 6” might start to sound like an anthem after a few spins.",0,"September 30, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shinichi-atobe-peace-of-mind-ep/
Fat Joe,Jealous One’s Envy,7.6,Rap,"Let’s play a game called: Is this Fat Joe story true, unverified, or complete bullshit? One day, when Tupac was locked up at the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York, Joe went on the radio and made a crack about the incarcerated rap star. Apparently, the Puerto Ricans affiliated with Joe in the same jail mistook that for beef and began to harass Pac to defend Joe’s honor. So Pac, from behind bars, made a pleading call to Joe as a way to get the heat off him. 1 Another time, in L.A., Fat Joe was hanging with the Westside Connection’s Mack 10 for a Sprite commercial shoot. Common, who had previously been involved in a historically acidic beef with Ice Cube and the Westside Connection until Louis Farrakhan eased the tensions, was there and got into an altercation with the crew. Supposedly, things were on the brink of violently escalating until Fat Joe, a.k.a. Joey Crack, stepped in and saved Common’s life. 2 Speed round time. Fat Joe not only booked Biggie for his first show ever—at The Fever in the Bronx—but also recorded an unreleased joint album with Big before his death full of no-holds-barred Tupac diss records. 3 When NBA wing Stephen Jackson was a rookie, Fat Joe secretly had two Puerto Rican heavies follow him around New York to ensure his safety. 4 Over the years Fat Joe paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in physical assault lawsuits for decades of thrashing rappers and civilians; some rumored to be blown out of proportion (Papoose), some urban legend (Masta Ace), some corroborated (Cuban Link). 5 On the day of the NYC blackout of 2003, Joe and Jay-Z were supposed to settle their heated beef as opposing coaches at a Rucker Park streetball game, with members of the hoops elite like LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Yao Ming on each side. 6 50 Cent was so pissed off by Joe’s guest feature on Ja Rule’s “New York” that an antics-riddled feud full of YouTube skit work not seen since the heyday of In Living Color to foul-mouthed rants on the stage of the VMAs, ignited. 7 The myths, the legends, the unbelievable made sort of believable: this is Fat Joe, though not the Fat Joe I grew up with as a kid in ’00s New York. In my eyes, he was a bald-headed cartoonish rap villain, always sporting flashy leathers, Yankee fitteds, and a massive chain to represent Terror Squad, his mostly Bronx-based clique. He was the Puerto Rican flag-waving radio giant with inescapable player rap-R&B hybrid joints with Jennifer Lopez, Thalia, and most famously, Ashanti. He was the dude who made silly appearances in Scary Movie 3 and Happy Feet, as an animated penguin named Seymour. He was one of the big bads of the video game Dej Jam: Fight for New York. He churned out smash hits that blasted out of the loudspeakers at Knicks games, like “New York,” “We Takin’ Over,” and “Lean Back,” a bare-knuckled scrum with Remy Ma softened by a shoulder-swaying dance that crossed over so hard that even my rap-hating grandmother hit that shit proudly. This is the yin and yang of Fat Joe, a beloved side-quest of New York hip-hop who has been punching above his weight on the mic for decades. Credit to a charisma that channels the spirit of one of those ’roided out professional wrestling stars of the ’80s with life-changing promos and above-average in-ring work. Have you ever heard someone throw Joe in their top five? Probably not. I’m not even sure those on his payroll do. But he is one of the most recognizable faces and voices in New York hip-hop history, repeatedly big-upped for his preternatural ability to be in the right rooms at the right time and reinvent himself at will. After more than three decades as a seen-it-all bridge between distant hip-hop eras, who was once upon a time a certified underground rap menace, he’s still standing. There’s even a 1995 album to his name that holds its own in the mid-’90s wave of drug dealer epics through wrecking-ball rhymes and an infatuation with the golden age of hip-hop, called Jealous One’s Envy. Stylized as J.O.E., simply because Crack wanted an excuse to turn his name into an acronym like his idols LL Cool J (Ladies Love Cool James) and KRS-One (Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody), his second album, a follow-up to his raw 1993 debut, is the audio version of a subway brawl. His slab-of-concrete voice, compared blasphemously in a 1995 Rolling Stone review to Biggie, brings a theatricality to his tough-minded goon music. Vignettes of being a loot-hungry, neighborhood terror are deepened by their autobiographical lens. “Here comes the nigga from the East/Who just been crowned for most hated by police,” he erupts on “Fat Joe’s in Town,” creating a visual of him storming through the five boroughs like Omar Little did Baltimore. The goal throughout the album is to get bread by any means necessary. Joe bluntly describes memories of hustling on the Bronx’s Trinity Åvenue and the violence that was everywhere (“Fuck around and get thrown off the project roof”; “A Puerto Rican villain who be dealin’ and illin’ for nothin’”). His Jeep door hard and no-nonsense bragging feels so much like the early days of Atlanta trap and Chicago drill, especially in how Joe makes his borough feel like it has invisible barriers, like a deal in Queensbridge or Red Hook might as well take place on the moon. And how his storytelling relies so much on his real-life cred as a hood boogeyman. Longtime journalist and podcaster Elliott Wilson spent the first paragraph of his 2022 GQ profile of Fat Joe recalling how shook he was of the rapper in the early ’90s; once, in a late-2000s MTV News clip, a trembling Papoose called Fat Joe a “bully”; G-Unit’s Tony Yayo said on Drink Champs there was nothing worse than beefing with Fat Joe. Even without any of that context, Joe relentlessly builds himself up as a tough guy, eternally ready to crack heads like a toothless hockey enforcer. Back then, Joseph Cartagena was a Puerto Rican-Cuban kid in the Forest Houses of the South Bronx, an area about 20 blocks away from Yankee Stadium that was decimated by the loss of jobs and housing, the usual aftershock of white flight. He came of age in the ’80s when hip-hop culture was rippling through the borough like wildfire. According to Joe, in his youth, he can remember catching KRS-One debut “The Bridge is Over” in a BX park, and he heard of his older brother’s work as a crate boy for Grandmaster Flash. Early on he could see Puerto Rican hip-hop pioneers in the flesh: Dazzled by the flyness of Tito of the Fearless Four and in awe of Ruby Dee of the Fantastic Five’s all-out softball games with his brothers. “Well Ruby Dee is my name and I’m Puerto Rican/You might think I’m Black the way I’m speakin’,” goes Ruby in one scene from 1983’s Wild Style, a graffiti-writing classic. Joe was a graffiti writer himself, getting kicked out of multiple intermediate schools for tagging his moniker “Crack!” on the walls. Contrary to the popular rumor that it came from selling crack, it was actually about a different crack, as he wrote in his 2022 memoir: “I was chubby, my pants would sag under my stomach and the crack of my ass was always showing.” In fact, Terror Squad started out as a graffiti crew Joey was a part of, morphing into a criminal enterprise for local stick-up kids and dealers to rep. By 14, he was robbing kids (he loves to tell a story about the time he cleaned out his entire high school gym class) and moving drugs underneath his older brother Angel, who, Joe claims, owned 47 luxury cars until addiction and jail got in the way. Occasionally Joe went bombing with his friend Joseph Kirkland from the same projects. The other Joe’s tag was “ZRock,” and he later went by Diamond D. In the late ’80s, Diamond was the producer-half of a rap duo known as Ultimate Force; they recorded a debut album that featured Joe on a couple of tracks. Eventually, Diamond broke through behind the boards—alongside storied beat-makers DJ Premier and Showbiz—on Funky Technician, the 1990 punchline-heavy debut from Lord Finesse and DJ Mike Smooth. Finesse and Showbiz grew up in the Forest Houses, too, and their success pushed Joe to link back up with Diamond where he did a bunch of ridiculously hostile ad-libbing on Diamond’s sample-crazy 1992 rap classic Stunts, Blunts & Hip Hop. Some time around that release was the formation of the tight-knit underground collective D.I.T.C, which stood for Diggin’ In the Crates, and housed Joe, Diamond, Finesse, Showbiz & A.G., O.C., Buckwild, and the late Big L. Joe’s charismatic blustering caught on fast, even before ever officially dropping a song. He won Amateur Night at the Apollo in Harlem four weeks in a row, got recruited by influential DJ Kool Red Alert to do a radio jingle, and co-hosted a few episodes of Video Music Box, the cherished television series that documented the growth of hip-hop in real time. His breakout single was also his first as a solo rapper, 1993’s “Flow Joe”—released as Fat Joe Da Gangsta on top of a funky beat by Diamond D. On the track, Joe’s street-tough lyrics are basic but he sounds like a human tsunami. The music video is the real highlight; shot in Greenpoint, Joe and his chest-beating crew act as if they’ve taken over an abandoned factory like the greedy crooks in Walter Hill’s Trespass. Months after “Flow Joe,” East Coast rap underwent a rapid transformation. Out came 36 Chambers and Ready To Die, and one day, Showbiz pulled up on Joe with an advance copy of Illmatic. You can feel that tirelessly canonized trifecta looming over Jealous One’s Envy. It’s in the rhyme schemes that long to be as layered as Nas’: “I be the top dolla scala, rockin’ gold collars/While you tryin’ to sip the juice, I’m takin’ swallows/Step into the zone and get blown my ways are internationally known,” he barks on “Success,” which is strong despite those G-league bars, specifically the breezy DJ Premier remix. It’s in “Envy,” which flips “Sexual Healing” into a phony “Juicy.” It’s definitely in the Raekwon-assisted “Respect Mine,” complete with a gloomy, string-heavy knockoff RZA beat and tryhard macabre vibes: “Sodomize your daughter and make a widow out your wife,” raps Joe, having a bit of an identity crisis. Crack is more compelling when he’s himself, an unfiltered Bronx roughhouser; a New York hip-hop obsessed moment maker; a heavyset showman like one of his heroes Heavy D. That can all be found in the album’s intro, a razor-sharp back and forth with KRS-One. By this time Joe had been bombing with his rap lodestar for a few years, and on “Bronx Tale,” underlined by Diamond’s mean bassline, their chemistry is so organic, as Joe’s powerful warning shots bounce off KRS’s acrobatic flow like they’re freestyling on Stretch and Bobbito. Later, on “Part Deux,” while repurposing the hook of “Flow Joe,” Joe brings the mafioso ruckus, living his rich ass fantasies: “Spilled your chips in the casino while feastin’ on shrimp scalappino.” When Fat Joe is in the zone, he sounds like a bucking bull at the rodeo. For one, the hard-nosed, lyrical rush of “Say Word”: “In cahoots with the San Juan authorities/Hated by majorities, loved by minorities.” Next, setting the future DJ Khaled template on “Watch Out,” acting as the loudmouthed hype man for a brooding Terror Squad posse cut. “Watch Out” is notable as the debut of Big Pun, the Nuyorican wordplay extraordinaire, who Fat Joe discovered freestyling outside a corner store in the Bronx and mentored until his death in 2000, at 28. Immediately Pun has the training wheels off, “Yo, I ’cause a bloody bath to make my buddies laugh and gig’,” spitting a borderline horrorcore verse like he was prone to do. The song ventures too far down that path, though, when Keith Nut pulls up later with child molestation threats. I wonder if anyone was like Are you sure about that one Keith? Scaling back slightly on the edginess, “This Shit is Real (DJ Premier Remix),” is J.O.E.’s holy grail. Premo bugs out on the scratches, and Joe’s lyrics are the perfect marriage of street realism and embellished sketches. “I’m sick and tired of being the bummiest nigga out the crew/I gotta get mine, I gotta get cash,” he raps, the desperation made as clear as any song on Mobb Deep’s nihilistic masterpiece The Infamous, from the same year, with the following lines: “I see a old man, I’m gonna rob him with the quick-fast/Gimme your motherfucking loot, papi.” At the same time, Joe drops in one-bar visuals that are as hilarious as they are bleak, “One day I went to visit my Aunt and stuck up my cuz.” It cracks me up every time, while also making the pitch-black, dog-eat-dog ecosystem of the South Bronx underworld evocative. Funny enough, more than a decade later, on an episode of Juan Epstein while promoting his return to the pits with 2010’s The Darkside Vol.1, a snickering Joe admitted that the story told in that bar is “partially true.” He only beat up his cousin for ripping off another cousin. So actually, he’s the hero. Threaded into Joe’s seedy Bronx memories are movie clips there to create a cinematic atmosphere, from King of New York, The Warriors, and a Spanish-language skit influenced by The Godfather. Cliché, I know. But three years later, on Joe’s third album Don Cartagena, he nailed that idea by fleshing out his Puerto Rican gangster persona and recruiting a deep guest list of rappers to create a Coppola-worthy ensemble of his own. In the process, Don Cartagena is the start of what Joey became: flashy hitmaker, professional mythmaker, a taste-forward New York rap nucleus who N.O.R.E referred to, hyperbolically, as the “The Puerto Rican Puff Daddy.” Gradually, Fat Joe switched out all the mean mugging for a daytime television smile. Six years after Jealous One’s Envy was the sequel, Jealous One’s Still Envy (J.O.S.E.), a decent album that went platinum and spawned multiple radio hits. Ten years later, Joe was on the stage at MTV VMA’s calling 50 Cent and G-Unit the police. Two decades later, Joe returned to the spotlight with “All the Way Up,” another one of those New York anthems that will be heard at sporting events forever. In recent years, turn on the TV and you might catch Crack guest hosting the Wendy Williams Show or giggling on Drew Barrymore or rubbing shoulders with janky politicians. A frequent guest on the rap and lifestyle podcast circuit, he’s a brand-friendly businessman more than anything else. His longevity is on par with the Snoops and Jays of the world, absorbed into everyday mainstream life. Almost 30 years ago he was in Ego Trip threatening to choke out Masta Ace now he’s the amiable host of a Starz interview series creatively called Fat Joe Talks. Surreal, but somehow, it feels right. Nowadays, pop culture is hip-hop culture; a lot of the time for the worst. If that’s the case at least Fat Joe gets to be one of the public faces carrying on the stories and folk tales, because there is one thing about him that doesn’t require any fact checks: Fat Joe is hip-hop.

1tbsp,megacity1000,7.0,Electronic,"Maxwell Byrne has a Pop artist’s appreciation for ridiculous scale and shiny surfaces. The Brisbane musician frequently complements his tracks with cartoonishly outsized set pieces like a human hamster cage, wonky papier-mâché lightning bolts, or Jurassic Park-style CGI bugs. For megacity1000, his second full-length dance record as 1tbsp, Byrne created a miniature metropolis of the future—a bizarro utopia, equal parts SimCity and Abu Dhabi—and added an spoken-word introduction rhapsodizing about the promise of urban living. Even if the record’s concept ultimately feels about as durable as the cardboard skyscrapers that Byrne and his partner spent a month toiling over, megacity1000 is his most reliably fun and intricately constructed collection of club music to date. As Golden Vessel, Byrne is an established figure in Australia’s indie-pop scene, and a prolific and respected collaborator with a host of artists including Mallrat and BAYNK (with whom he was nominated for a Grammy last year). But Byrne has also become an increasingly in-demand DJ, and he’s released a clutch of well-received bangers as 1tbsp. That’s a promising development, because he’s a more compelling producer than he is a performer; his ear for detail conveys far more personality than the bland anonymity of his winsome Triple J vocal delivery. Byrne has an easy and infectious command of rhythm, stacking his drums so that they thump, rattle, and gallop all at once, and balancing his tracks’ pent-up momentum with blindingly bright synths. This interplay between surface shimmer and rhythmic muscle makes even the most relentless songs feel oddly lightweight and lithe. “Neurasync” and “MC1K” give off a metallic glint reminiscent of K-LONE at his most punchy and dynamic, while the bouncy guitar groove supporting the affectless vocals on “Somebody Pay Nina” sounds as if someone took Oli XL on a tropical vacation. Even though Byrne’s fictional city doesn’t belong to any specific geographic region, it’s hard to imagine it isn’t located within earshot of a TraTraTrax party. The influence of Latin club is pronounced across the record, particularly in its many sped-up reggaeton samples, which he uses to heighten the intensity. Given the relatively short run time, the recurrence of those motifs can occasionally feel like a crutch, a shorthand for another level of party-starting that 1tbsp doesn’t totally earn. The best Spanish-language track by far is “Limosina,” which features a shit-talking performance by Cherry Chola. Byrne lays down spritely synth plucks and an impatient, stuttering beat; the Venezuelan Australian singer compares her glamorous lifestyle with your shitty Corolla before driving off to the sound of garish flashing synths. The two forceful personalities cut a carefree path through Byrne’s imagined city, conveying a particularly inspired sense of place.",0,"September 3, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1tbsp-megacity1000/
Molchat Doma,Belaya Polosa,7.1,Rock,"Four years ago, the Belarusian post-punk band Molchat Doma went viral on TikTok, and their take on post-Soviet melancholy became the soundtrack to moody videos made across the globe. Since then, Russia has accelerated its ongoing attacks on Ukraine, and the members of Molchat Doma have had to leave home. Now they live among Los Angeles’ palm trees, far from the oxidizing Eastern bloc with which they’ve been so closely associated—but their melancholy remains. On Belaya Polosa, their fourth album (and first since 2020), Molchat Doma continues to channel ’80s goth-rock sounds in service of their particular brand of gloom, bringing more ebullient, confident instrumentation into the mix. While Monument, Molchat Doma’s last album, was dominated by leaden Bauhaus guitars, Belaya Polosa whirrs with Tangerine Dream’s industrial batwings; most of the album is propelled by frantic drum machines and synths. Like dogs waiting to be fed, these pulsing sounds scramble over and into each other, and the effect is captivating. “Ты Же Не Знаешь Кто Я / Ty Zhe Ne Znaesh Kto Ya” hisses for a full minute before vocalist Egor Shkutko enters its frenzy, and the darkness of his voice pulls you deeper into cool hypnosis. Then it wavers, as if it were disappearing in acid: “You can’t hear me, you can’t imagine who I am,” Shkutko sings in Russian. Belaya Polosa luxuriates in restlessness. Lyrics describe days without sleep, how winter is unrelenting, and why love, if it even exists, sits too far away. Throughout, Shkutko wails: on “Черные Цветы / Chernye Cvety,” singing of disillusionment over a silky Cocteau Twins groove; on “Не Вдвоëм / Ne Vdvoem,” a yacht rock song for goths; on “Колесом / Kolesom,” while he’s being barraged by synth hail. The album’s indulgent hopelessness is best encapsulated by the image of the passive, watching moon in “Зимняя / Zimnyaya,” a song whose effervescent melody spills bitterly, like old champagne. But for how morose it is, Belaya Polosa also twitches with agitated energy. Its best moments are its firework flashes, the synth sparkles and bass booms on songs like “Белая Полоса / Belaya Polosa,” which prop up Shkutko’s continually sinking feelings. “Я Так Устал / Ya Tak Ustal” likewise features a delightfully maximalist synth whine, circling Shkutko’s desperation like a hopeful ring of sunlight. But moments when that energy falters—like on the torpid intermission, “Безнадежный Вальс / Beznadezhniy Waltz,” or when you realize you’re listening to the same drum tone for the fifth song in a row—drag the album down to melodramatic lows. Still, Belaya Polosa communicates the same dust-covered nostalgia that made Molchat Doma so appealing to housebound TikTok users in 2020. Their brand of ’80s pastiche offers one kind of safety in an otherwise dangerous world. My Bulgarian mother always tells me that we—Eastern Europeans, or maybe just people with anxiety disorders—are destined to suffer. While contemporary political and personal unrest continues to invade the lives of Molchat Doma’s members—and those of many other people—their music remains firmly rooted in the past. Even if it’s not entirely innovative, it offers a sense of security, and that can be its own reward. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

One Dove,Morning Dove White,8.7,Electronic,"The press, in the early ’90s, used a lot of conflicting, if creative, words to describe the music of One Dove. The Scottish band’s 1993 debut album, produced by the DJ and musician Andrew Weatherall, delighted many, disappointed some, and confounded others. Project X magazine, an American publication catering to ravers (which included infamous party monster Michael Alig on staff), put the band’s singer Dot Allison on the cover in a scuba diving suit and declared them to make “some of the most emotion-filled electronic music since the techno-revolution began.” The New York Times called their album “a juxtaposition of eerie, languorous electronics, bleary borderline dance music and quietly torchy pop songs.” The NME, though loquacious, was not convinced. They appreciated that while the band had a “vision of blasting mainstream pop sky high with clubland’s mighty beats and sun-drenched vibes,” ultimately Morning Dove White was “likely to lull you into a light coma.” Were One Dove here to humanize the mechanical sound of acid house then taking over clubs? Or were their dreamy guitar solos meant to help future-proof the suddenly staid sound of British rock? Was singer Dot Allison a star or a snooze? Was everybody even listening to the same band? To that last point, based on the extensive amount of remixes they released, as well as early album leaks with alternate mixes, it’s possible that, no, they were not. Regardless, in the 31 years since their sole LP Morning Dove White was released, not too many people have listened to any version of the album. It has been out of print for nearly 25 years, and, until recently, not on streaming services. To add insult to injury, the version available on streaming services now mistakenly repeats track six, “My Friend,” as track seven, “Transient Truth.” “Listen now,” sings Allison on that song, which, if you don’t have a physical copy, you’ll have to head to YouTube to hear, “If you take my words as promises, well then you can keep them.” At least they never felt like they owed anyone anything. Undoubtedly some of the hype surrounding the album isn’t even of their own making: The band had persuaded Weatherall—renowned for his sledgehammering of genre barriers—to produce their debut. This was immediately after he’d worked with Primal Scream on their groundbreaking album, Screamadelica, which was released to great fanfare during the recording of Morning Dove White. That album’s massive swell, its groundbreaking blend of ecstatic rock guitar work and buoyant house music drum work, became Weatherall’s signature sound. He’d bring some of that in a more subdued form to Morning Dove White. That’s undeniable. Whether he also brought unmeetable expectations is up for debate. Morning Dove White begins with “Fallen,” their breakout single. Legend has it, when One Dove—the trio of Allison, guitarist Jim McKinven, and keyboardist Ian Carmichel—was pursuing Weatherall, they met him at one of his DJ sets in Italy. They slipped him a copy of the “Fallen” single, which Weatherall played on the spot to warm reception. The next day, he played them Screamadelica demos on the beach before agreeing to collaborate. Fact or fantasy, a Mediterranean origin story is befitting. It often sounds like the music’s been bleached by the sun. Weatherall has a cosmic sleight of hand that takes a song’s naked bombast and cools it with a lithe touch. He doesn’t reduce its power, just softens its edges. When Primal Scream’s Bobby Gillespie quietly coos that he’s “higher than the sun,” it has a churchlike echo that feels like a bad boy’s manipulation of holiness. On a more practical level, Weatherall really likes drums you play with your hands—congas, bongos, djembes. Both Screamadelica and Morning Dove White are dripping in Weatherallisms. But those expecting a repeat of Screamadelica misread the direction of his creativity. It moves in all directions at once, not linearly. If he made One Dove sound more like anyone, it’s themselves. “Fallen” was written without Weatherall, though he did rework it for the album. But hearing the original (at least, one of the original of the three pre-Weatherall mixes) proves they didn’t need him to craft an ebullient slice of weirdness on their own. Playing the two versions, pre-Weatherall and post, back to back, you hear some subtle tweaks, but it’s more like Weatherall took the track and recommended cleansing it with incense. It’s still the same song, only tender. The original version included a spoken intro making clear the lyrical reference to “angel from this dream I have” is a nod to The Catcher in the Rye. On the version that opens the album, it’s been cut, as though he encouraged them to keep their cards just a little closer to their chest. A little mystery never hurt anyone. To that point, the primary vocals on the song are whispers. Allison mostly doesn’t sing, and when she does, it’s buried in reverb. She talks hushedly about secrets. You can hear a tinge of her Scottish accent. “Don’t know why I’m telling you any of this,” she says as the song begins. It’s like she’s pulling you close for a tête-à-tête: listen up, this is important. “One thing is, don’t ever tell anyone I told you this.” Is she talking about One Dove itself? After a couple decades in relative obscurity, it feels like it. Like most of the songs on Morning Dove White, “Fallen” is a dance track from a rock band, not the other way around. Never the other way around. You can always sense their roots in regular old guitar music as part of a song’s structure—there’s often a hint of reggae in the guitars and drums—but it’s not what thrills about a track. That’s in the discovery of everything else they can do to accent it. Listening to the album could be a portal to rave culture, soul, dub, trip-hop, even the radio pop of the era. The music vibrates with so much excitement that you get the feeling, for the members of the band, still so young, making Morning Dove White was as much about discovery as it was about declaration. “We each bring a lot of ingredients,” Allison told Spin in 1993, “but together we bake a new cake.” With so much going on, it’s a miracle the album never manages to trip over its own feet. The songs, long and sprawling, move in and out of genres with little regard for consistency. But they all congeal. Track two, “White Love - Guitar Paradise Mix” opens with a lurching guitar solo, a minute and 45 seconds of something that sounds lifted from Metal Machine Music. Then hip-hop drums break out and trippy keys turn the whole thing into Deee-Lite worship. Track three, “Breakdown - Cellophane Boat Mix” (what is a cellophane boat?), opens with more hip-hop drums accented by a lovely piano run. Dubby bass enters, then the sound of a record scratching before the whole thing turns on a dime at what sounds like the ding of the oven announcing it’s been preheated. Allison saunters in gently. “Breakdown and cry,” she croons over the returned piano chords and the whoosh of an egg shaker. The chorus ends and the oven dings once again. Then a man intones what sounds like a Laurence Fishburne line in The Matrix, a movie still several years in the future. “Against the black-blue sky, the shadow of the dove. The gentle wind’s diversion. An open mind’s excursion.” Allison finishes things up with a breakup lament and a shout-out to the moon. “Sirens” makes room for two solos, one on a bluesy organ solo and the other on an accordion. It wraps things up with a twangy guitar strut. What even is this music? Allison has referenced the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds as a touchstone for Morning Dove White; McKinven the music of dub originator King Tubby. Those are two vastly different source materials, though what they share is a love of resonance and reverb, creation of a vastness as funneled through the mixing board. Weatherall is a producer in the lineage of Brian Wilson and King Tubby, futzing around with the knobs so that a song swoops and whorls. The Beach Boys deployed this experimentation in small doses, accent pieces in their perfect pop songs, whereas King Tubby and Weatherall built songs around the echoes themselves. Neither met a song they couldn’t extend. Single-digit running time? Amateur hour. Weatherall could always squeeze more out of any tune. Most of the songs on Morning Dove White are 10 minutes or above—plenty of room for them to not only delight but to mesmerize. “My Friend,” the closest the band gets to actually making a techno track, rides along at a mid-pace, bolstered by gauzy vocals from Allison, a snare roll echoed to infinity. Everything builds and builds, while you breathlessly await an explosion. It never comes. “There Goes the Cure” wafts out the gates at a leisurely clip, with Allison’s voice doubled, maybe tripled, with a small choir behind her. She even literally sings about echo while being echoed: “Losing a shadow/Losing another soul/So many echoes/And oh/No more.” The congenial piano riff repeats while the sound of digital crickets breaks, briefly, into the sound of screams. A string section builds, fades. “He’s gone,” Allison repeats for several minutes. Again, no explosion. Climax was never the point. I’ve been trying to figure out why Morning Dove White disappeared from public view for so long. The band recorded some of a second album, but broke up before it was finished; those songs were never released. Surely a continued lack of presence did not help keep up their profile, but they did tour behind Morning Dove White and, after the band’s breakup, Allison released several solo albums. One in ten people I ask about the band gush about how much they love them and how unfairly ignored they have been. The other nine don’t know who I’m talking about. Was it the sepia-toned album cover, a dour brown so unbefitting of such a bright piece of music? Was Weatherall’s presence, ostensibly so crucial, actually an albatross around their necks, a high-profile co-conspirator whose adjacent work eclipsed their one moment, dooming them to never have another? Or did One Dove, so eager to work with disparate sonics, aim for the future and miss? There’s some weight to that argument, as, with the ease of technological collage, so much of music continues to ignore genre in favor of cannibalization. But as I report live from the future, I can confidently say Morning Dove White is not the sound of our modern dystopia. Even with its lyrical hints of tough breakups and pining sadness, it’s simply too sweet a record for our sour times. It’s fresh, alive, searching. Eternal qualities. Morning Dove White isn’t a record of any certain time; it’s a classic.",0,"May 26, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/one-dove-morning-dove-white/
Mdou Moctar,Funeral for Justice,8.4,Rock,"Uranium extraction is backbreaking work. Workers spend hours in the mines operating heavy machinery while risking exposure to radioactive chemicals. In Niger, uranium comprises almost its entire export product, but its government sees virtually none of the profit. Instead, France, its former colonial occupier, still controls most of the country’s supply, using the minerals to power a third of its domestic electricity while almost 90 percent of Nigerien citizens are left without access to power. And though France finally relinquished all military bases in Niger following a 2023 military coup, many of its mines remain active to this day, leaking radon into the water supply of surrounding towns. On his new album Funeral for Justice, Tuareg guitarist Mdou Moctar addresses these abuses directly. “Why does your ear only heed France and America?/Occupiers are carving up your lands/Gallantly marching all over your resources,” he sings in his native Tamasheq on its title track. You might not pick up on all of the finer details from listening to the first song from Moctar’s monumental new album, but it’s hard to miss the sound of righteous fury in its opening guitar chords, which ricochet like the first shots in battle. When speaking to The New York Times, Moctar said he wanted to make his guitar sound like a person crying for help, or the piercing cry of an ambulance’s siren. In his most directly political album yet, Moctar lets his solos become the sound of his fury when his Tamasheq lyrics aren’t enough. “I make music to make people smile,” Moctar recently told Crack Magazine, and so far, that music has garnered him plenty of success among Western audiences. Just a few weeks ago, Moctar and his exceptional live band—Souleymane Ibrahim on percussion, Ahmoudou Madassane on rhythm guitar, and Mikey Coltun on bass—took the stage at Coachella to bring their exhilarating live show to their biggest crowd yet. At that performance, Moctar himself couldn’t help but grin as he stepped away from the mic and began one of his now legendary solos, his fingers nimbly dancing across both the body and fretboard of his lefty guitar, stacking melodies atop each other until they seemed to take on a life of their own. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that the lyrics scan as an immediate plea to the American audiences: “My people are crying while you laugh/All you do is watch.” And perhaps just to get his point across more fiercely, Mdou Moctar does not shy away from power chords or distortion, instead leaning into the anger and power of the D.C. punk scene that birthed bassist and producer Coltun on “Funeral for Justice.” “Sousoume Tamacheq” is a synthesis of these ideas, meshing a breakneck rhythm section with the sounds of traditional Tuareg instruments like the three-string fretless tehardent or the gourd-shaped calabash. The result is an exuberant and enraged call for Tamasheq unity that sounds just as urgent as it reads on the page. Funeral for Justice is the result of extended improvised sessions with the full Mdou Moctar band, condensed and edited by Coltun for maximum impact. The band often develops its music live, and there’s an artifact of that process here: “Imouhar,” the spellbinding, slow-building ode to Tamasheq cultural pride, grew from an instrumental riff on 2022’s Niger EP Vol. 1. Layered over nothing but a simple drum machine, that guitar rhythm was promising yet ultimately limited—without a full band, the 13-minute song seemed stuck in an endless groove. But the album version, with a full band and Moctar’s voice, transforms the song into a swaggering blues rock stunner. For the first minute of the song, it sounds as if everyone is performing behind a screen, before a surging guitar solo crashes like a tidal wave, flooding every possible inch of listenable air with Moctar’s towering fretwork, each transition more nimble than the last. For Moctar, music is inextricably linked with political expression: the assouf or “desert blues” Tuareg musical lineage from which Moctar partially derives his style has always been a way of engendering unity and documenting sociopolitical upheaval. Moctar’s sentiments were clear on his 2021 album Afrique Victime: “Africa is a victim of so many crimes/If we stay silent it will be the end of us.” But the urgency of his message could be overlooked if all the listener chooses to hear is an uptempo guitar groove. On Funeral for Justice, it’s impossible to miss—from the blood dripping off of the crows on its album cover to the screeching guitars that open its first song, it’s the proud sound of rebellion, transposed from Tamasheq into a language that refuses to be misinterpreted.

Jon McKiel,Hex,7.6,Rock,"Jon McKiel’s life and music changed forever when he bought a haunted reel-to-reel. When the equipment arrived at his home in rural New Brunswick, the singer-songwriter discovered a tape still wound into the machine, full of odd song fragments and guitar noodlings recorded by its previous owner. Who was he? When did he make those recordings? What dreams did he have for his music? Nobody could say. McKiel and his co-producer Jay Crocker (better known as JOYFULTALK) dubbed the anonymous artist Bobby Joe Hope, welcomed him as a full collaborator, and even named the subsequent album after him. The songs on 2020’s Bobby Joe Hope sampled snippets of his unfinished songs into unusual sound collages that disrupted McKiel’s solid, if familiar, guitar rock and inspired him to work new sounds and styles into his repertoire. Hope doesn’t appear on Hex, but the ghost of his ghost lingers. McKiel and Crocker have further refined their recombinant techniques, only this time they sample McKiel himself, assembling his own studio experiments into unusual amalgams of blues, dub, soul, folk, tropicália, and more. The songs are compellingly disorienting; their melodies are as tight as the grooves are strange—hypnotic, slightly off. McKiel and Crocker continually blur the distinction between live performance and manipulated recording. “String,” which sounds like Paul Simon lost in the Bush of Ghosts, layers a crisp guitar over a slightly distorted one, their melodic lines twining together. It’s like listening to someone play along to the stereo in the next room, and in its uncanniness the moment is both unsettling and unexpectedly beautiful. Everything on Hex seems both familiar and foreign. The title track stacks a distorted and truncated guitar lick over a busy bassline and a drumbeat that sounds like it’s been borrowed from a ’90s rap sample of a ’60s jazz tune, but it’s the free-floating saxophone that tilts the song just off its axis. The jangly pomp of “Everlee” is so recognizable as a Byrds reference that you might get that right-on-the-tip-of-your-tongue frustration from trying to name the tune. Closer “Memory Screen Pt. 2” warps a breezy guitar strum until it nearly breaks, then descends into windswept collage of guitar distortion, disembodied voices, and what might be whalesong, or static off an EVP mic. Each tinkers with a different idea, deploys voice and guitar toward new ends, yet they all fit together like puzzle pieces. Otherworldly as it often sounds, Hex is primarily concerned with the fate of this world. McKiel’s cover of “Concrete Sea,” by Terry Jacks (an underrated singer-songwriter as well as an environmental activist), presents the city as an environment unfit for humans: “No one is meant to be living here in a concrete sea,” he chants. “Everyone, including me, wishes he could be set free.” McKiel resents the erasure of wonder, the mundane encroaching on everyday magic—a timely concern now that bands are proudly using AI to write songs. McKiel finds humanity in a bit of confusion, and on this oddly affecting album he comes across as a medium, closely attuned to the unknown and unknowable as he deciphers missives from another plane.

Griff,Vertigo,5.8,Pop/R&B,"On 11 May 2021, a minor pop schism occurred. It was the first Brit awards in the pandemic, delayed a few months from the ceremony’s usual February date. That night, two young stars who made their names in lockdown had massive debuts: Olivia Rodrigo’s first-ever live performance, of “drivers license,” and the British pop songwriter Griff’s second ever, of the very Gotye-like “Black Hole.” Backstage, that year’s Global Icon winner Taylor Swift held court in her dressing room, inviting the two self-proclaimed Swifties to share chips and take goofy selfies. Not two months later, it emerged that Swift had been awarded 50% of the writing credit for Rodrigo’s song “deja vu,” which had a faintly similar bridge to her song “Cruel Summer,” leading to an obvious distancing between the two. Meanwhile Swift has continued to shout out Griff and invited her to support a recent Eras date in London, praising her from the stage as “so creative on every single level.” What’s curious about the continued support, given the apparent reason for the estrangement of Swift and Rodrigo, is how profoundly indebted Griff’s debut album, Vertigo, is to Swift’s sound. This year’s The Tortured Poets Department watered down the boom and sheen of Swift’s 2014 album 1989, which is further diluted by the eminently tasteful pop songs of Vertigo. The racing pulses never risk causing alarm. The bubbling synths would barely disturb the surface of any pond. The martial drums are more ceremonial than primed for battle. There’s a cavernous, momentous glow to the production that reminds me of how the 1989 portion of the Eras tour echoes around the stadium every night. The quieter songs, like “Into the Walls” and “Everlasting,” immediately evoke the tenderly plucked strings and twig-snap beats of Folklore and Evermore. Obviously none of that suggests that Griff should be held liable for taking inspiration from a formative songwriting hero (she’s said her earliest musical memory is getting an iPod loaded with Fearless and playing it on repeat) or that creativity should be litigated that way. It’s just one aspect of how oddly derivative this long-gestating debut is. Tilt it this way and you hear the formal liturgies of London Grammar (soppy ballad “Astronaut,” piano courtesy of Chris Martin); that and the long tail of the excitement over 2010s Scandi pop that never really anointed any proper pop stars (the desperate, cathartic splash of the appealing “Miss Me Too” has Robyn in its DNA). Here’s a little MUNA (the gently punchy and ecstatic “Anything”); here’s quite a lot of the 1975 (the snapping “Hiding Alone,” the surprisingly loose dance breaks of “Cycles”). Griff (born Sarah Griffiths) got her start by releasing music online and in 2019 quietly signed a deal with Warner in the midst of doing her final high school exams. She broke out in 2020 with “Good Stuff,” a piano ballad direct enough to connect during the pandemic when Instagram was the only way to perform for fans. When concerts became possible again, she supported Dua Lipa, Coldplay, and Ed Sheeran, all but skipping mid-tier venues. That night at the Brits three years ago, she won the Rising Star award, the weight of the British music industry behind her. Griff has never failed to hit her marks professionally. Her songs—which she also co-produces, and always has—also come with a distinct air of competency. Nothing is off; Vertigo is very well-studied and primed to reach the rafters of the mega venues she was thrust into early on. It just lacks much sense of her in it, and for an album seemingly about being failed by a vanishing lover and named after the physical sensation that the world is lurching on its axis, it seems more focused on finding steadiness again than embodying those head-spinning feelings. Griff sings in a tone of rueful anguish about falling for what now appears to be an illusion; even the relatively riotous breakdown of the clattering, choral pop moment “Tears for Fun” processes her voice to mute the rage in it. The subtleties are very subtle: “Pillow in My Arms” is softly tweaky, Griff’s desperation blurred into a whirlwind; ominous serrated textures bite at the lonely “19th Hour,” where she sounds convincingly on her last nerve. The frustratingly slick Vertigo speaks to two issues. First, how to translate pandemic pop stardom into the real thing—giving a promising, major-signed young artist the opportunity to work out her voice on her own terms, and adapt to a scale bigger than a phone screen but smaller than a stadium. And second, how entrenched the Scandinavian formalities of pop songwriting have become in the last 15 years. When the rigors of craft are well established, the artist’s personality becomes even more critical, and this summer’s reigning outlandish, cheeky, brash pop girls have illuminated and fed that hunger. For all that Griff has aced the industry’s rungs and garnered all the right plaudits, Vertigo can’t hope to compete with peers who have taken weirder routes to their breakout moments. Griff’s talents are so clear you suspect she could do this with her eyes closed; may she yet escape the industry tractor beam to take some shots in the dark.

Christopher Owens,I Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair,7.2,Rock,"“He’s going to make another record soon, almost certainly,” Pitchfork’s Jayson Greene wrote of Christopher Owens while reviewing 2015’s Chrissybaby Forever. He didn’t. In 2017, the former Girls frontman’s motorcycle collided with an SUV, leaving him bedridden and unable to afford medical care. A string of losses followed that would be unendurable for most people: his fiancée, his job, his apartment, his cat, his favorite guitar. At rock bottom, he reached out to his former Girls partner Chet “JR” White for a reunion, but White was barely responsive at the sessions and died not long afterward at age 40. Owens seems to be faring better now, married to a new partner, but his new album, I Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair, is a travelogue of his journey through hell. It’s Owens’ most careful and deliberate solo album, and the tempo rarely exceeds a crawl. While Chrissybaby crammed 16 songs into just under an hour, Barefoot has 10 songs in about the same time. This makes sense: Chrissybaby was recorded almost entirely by Owens, an approach less conducive to sprawl than jamming with a band. Owens has a fine one here, led by the oozy lead guitar work of Derek Barber (of Perhapsy and Owens’ erstwhile band Curls), and he allows himself the gospel-tinged crescendos and classic ’70s album-rock majesty he hasn’t approached since Girls’ swan song Father, Son, Holy Ghost. The physical toll Owens’ ordeal took on him is audible in his voice, which is deeper and raspier than before. Owens’ singing has traditionally been flecked with little rockabilly hiccups and vocal-fry fractures, but here every note is articulated and sung with such purpose it’s as if he’s pulled each one individually from his throat. His attention to phrasing on ballads like “Distant Drummer” and the devastating gospel song “I Think About Heaven” makes it easy to imagine him singing a jazz standard like “My Funny Valentine.” At times his voice slides from one note to another a bit too easily, indicating that some doctoring may have been necessary for Owens to sing the pop melodies rattling in his head. The lyrics are short on specifics, but Owens has always written as if he were snipping tried-and-true lines from the annals of pop history and gluing them together. It says as much about Owens’ clarity of vision as his circumstances that “Things don’t seem so bad/Things don’t seem so sad” lands like a burst of redemptive divine light. With such a direct unburdening of pain, this blunt and unpoetic writing style is an advantage. In a pop songwriting zeitgeist where empathy and sincerity are the operative words, it’s rare to hear a song as vindictive as “No Good,” which kicks off the album on a savage tirade against his former fiancée. “Fuck off, stay gone/Look what you’ve done,” he cries. The refusal to empathize with what his ex might be feeling is kind of impressive; it’s a breakup song in its purest form. Barefoot’s flaws, though, owe more to circumstance than any indication that Owens’ songwriting spark has dimmed. The vocal processing sometimes coexists uneasily with the rugged quality his voice has developed. Chrissybaby Forever and his second album, the come-to-Jesus country-gospel jamboree A New Testament, explode with an energy and playfulness altogether missing on Barefoot—though nobody would seriously expect a man who ends the record by singing “I’m barely making it through the days” eight times to pen skippy pop songs. This is a slow, steady album; if you thought MJ Lenderman was uncompromising in his lolling tempos, this album might make you feel like time is flowing backward after a few tracks. What’s most promising for Owens’ music at this juncture in his career is the newfound stability he seems to be enjoying. Making it as a musician full-time is impossible for most artists, especially in rock, a genre that’s expensive to record and tour behind, and especially in San Francisco, where rising rents in the 2010s led to a mass exodus of the fertile scene that produced Girls and other acts like Thee Oh Sees, Ty Segall, and the Fresh & Onlys. Owens has settled in the marginally less expensive climes of New York, and an exciting second act seems to be shaping up. He’s going to make another record soon, almost certainly.

Carlos Niño & Friends,Placenta,7.9,Jazz / Experimental,"As a potentially psychedelic experience that often transcends description, new-age music finds an unexpected analog in human birth. There’s nothing trippier or more ineffable than generating new life, deploying cellular tools to create something more than the sum of its parts. With tracks like “Generous Pelvis” and “Placenta, Nourishment, New Home, The Galaxy,” Carlos Niño & Friends’ Placenta makes explicit the connection between the genre’s fascination with womb-like sounds and the physical odyssey of labor. Assembling a who’s-who of the L.A. ambient-jazz scene—including tourmate André 3000, who plays flute on “Birthworkers Magic, and how we get hear…”—and a heady concoction of bells, chimes, synths, whistles, leaves, plants, and shakers, Niño and his far-out compatriots develop an LP with a life of its own—a gestalt marvel. Opening track “Love to all Doulas!” sets the tone for this mystical instrumental odyssey, Nate Mercereau’s horns punctuating a drone that builds like something (or someone) crowning. “Some rest for the Midwives…” locks us into the groove, an itinerant shuffle that was recorded live with drummer Jamire Williams and saxophonist Sam Gendel in the historically spiritual SoCal town of Ojai. Later, the sound of breathwork and an accordion expand and contract like two sets of ribs on “Placenta, Nourishment, New Home, The Galaxy.” Thematic breaks, like the compact and propulsive “In Appreciation of Chico Hamilton’s Vast Influence on the West Coast Sound,” provide a welcome respite from feet-in-the-stirrups embodiment. They also keep the record from becoming too conceptually on the nose, flexing Niño & Friends’ range and dynamism. “This ‘I’ was not” takes French composer Ariel Kalma’s spoken-word meditation on ego and lifts it out of the yoga studio with shimmering cymbals and warbling organ. “Either you is, or not. Not more. Nevertheless, life is—always,” he intones, teasing a Seussian riddle stage-set with celestial sounds. “Bi-Location,” another (undetectably) live recording named after the concept of inhabiting two different places in the same physical body at the same time, showcases Andres Renteria’s nimble hand drumming underneath a layer of hazy synthesizer, a sound like something crawling towards the surface and then panting in the aftermath against Aaron Shaw’s dreamy tenor sax. Like much of Carlos Niño & Friends’ work, the record straddles the boundary between structure and improvisation, jazzy riffs and spasms that return to the gravitational pull of a central motif. “Surges, Expansions” feels the most in progress and least finished, a little unsure of itself (albeit aptly titled). “Moonlight Watsu in Dub” is the record’s most conventional attempt at a groove, groomed enough to play in the lobby of a chic hotel, and all the less interesting because of it. But where much of Placenta could have been corny and try-hard, its redemption lies in its earnestness. “The baby’s whole universe: the placenta,” breathes Haize Hawke, a meditation teacher and doula herself, on “Placenta, Nourishment, New Home, The Galaxy,” and a baby’s murmurs a few bars later only underscore the reverence. Maybe life is a miracle; maybe birth, something commonplace, is as far as many of us get from the mundane. Jazz breathes new life into new age’s platitudinous tropes, taking us to weirder and more interesting terrain than memefied truisms. The record’s best songs, like birth, feel hard-won and revelatory—journeys that might take place on a single physical plane, but expand psychically outward, broadening the spectrum of beauty, personhood, and existence.

The Folk Implosion,Walk Thru Me,6.4,Experimental / Rock,"The Folk Implosion certainly wasn’t the first 1990s indie rock act to tinker with the sample-based structures of hip-hop, but their approach to genre fusion may have been the most prescient. “Natural One,” the duo’s unlikely Billboard-charting hit and best-known contribution to Larry Clark’s Kids soundtrack, was a reaction to recently released major label debuts by Portishead and Beck, translating the group’s usual plunking bedroom recordings into a beat-driven context while consciously avoiding the sardonic tone of a track like “Loser.” As Lou Barlow and John H. Davis grew into their new sound, their experimentation became increasingly distinct, particularly on their last album, 1999’s One Part Lullaby, which fully realized their blend of glitched-out electronic composition, gritty drum breaks, and whispery emo pop. From a contemporary perspective, the album’s title cut and the vocoder-infused “E.Z. L.A.” feel like an embryonic version of recent work by brakence or Jane Remover: intimate, yet futuristic in equal measure. Following the release of 2023’s Music for KIDS compilation—a retrospective look behind the scenes of the soundtrack sessions that inspired the Folk Implosion’s embrace of electronica—Barlow and Davis have returned with their first body of new work in 25 years. Walk Thru Me, written remotely before the pair hit the studio with producer Scott Solter, is a return to the group’s roots as penpals. They’ve also largely abandoned their hip-hop influences, dusting off the droning indie rock sound of the band’s formative years and giving it a fresh coat of paint. While early Folk Implosion outings like Take a Look Inside and Palm of My Hand were patchwork affairs comprised of crunchy thrash, stoned jam sessions and bite-sized lo-fi pop gems, Walk Thru Me lacks their mercurial mystique. Davis, who is currently studying Persian music, incorporates stringed Middle Eastern instruments like setar, oud, and saz into his songwriting, though he and Barlow stick to a familiar formula throughout, noodling and down-stroking over leisurely, mid-tempo drum patterns. Without the Folk Implosion’s typically unpredictable energy, the duo’s knack for conjuring surreal harmonic atmospheres is dampened by boilerplate beats and song structure. The shift toward more polished, fleshed-out songcraft finds greater success on the lyrical front. On “My Little Lamb,” Barlow grapples with his approach to parenting, weighing his protective instincts against the wisdom that “they’ve gotta wonder on their own.” With a conversational cadence that recalls Jad Fair, Davis’ turns at the mic are painstaking snapshots of adult ennui, describing the numbing effects of robocalls and televised sports on “Bobblehead Dolls,” and trying to put himself in the neurological headspace of his late father on “The Day You Died.” Earlier Folk Implosion material reveled in abstract expression, balling up scribbled pages of adolescent catharsis on songs like “Daddy Never Understood” or “Mood Swing” and chucking them into oblivion. The fragmented lyricism suited the dashed-off, DIY quality of Barlow and Davis’ mid-’90s output, but here their angst translates to full storytelling quite naturally. Many of the cuts on Walk Thru Me, like “Moonlit Kind” and “Crepuscular,” swirl formlessly, riding spin cycles of fingerpicked acoustic guitar, twangy slides, and reverb-laden riffs. But when the duo ratchets up the BPM, their ideas coalesce into a tight, krautrock-inspired groove that recalls the first two DIIV albums. “O.K. to Disconnect” wields tension and dissonance masterfully, coiling nimble guitar leads around a motorik rhythm section and letting them venture into cryptic atonality during instrumental breaks. “The Fable and the Fact” also makes ample room for Barlow and Davis to jam between verses, bouncing wriggling peals of distorted guitar off of springy low end. The contrast between the duo’s understated vocal presence and their turbulent improvisational chemistry is most potent when they’re moving fast, letting rushed melodic phrases spill over the song’s margins. Chaos is still encoded into the Folk Implosion’s DNA, but Walk Thru Me’s idiomatic alt-rock composition feels too stable to properly channel it. At their best, Barlow and Davis wrestled with seemingly opposing interests in the primal and futuristic: After a long period of inactivity, they’re still finding their footing in the present.

Skee Mask,Resort,7.7,Electronic,"Before he was Skee Mask, Bryan Müller was SCNTST. Monday, the Munich producer’s debut EP, is straightforward and delirious, full of tightly wound grooves and head-spinning change-ups; it rockets between electro, ghettotech, juke, and techno, each track containing as many ideas as it does drum patterns. With that EP, Müller was looking less toward science than alchemy—an approach that proved indicative. As Skee Mask, Müller has spent the past decade combining dance-music histories in all sorts of beguiling ways: dubbed-out hardgroove techno, fleet-footed drum ’n’ bass and bone-chilling ambience, psychedelic and minimalistic IDM. Resort, the electronic producer’s latest LP, may be his most potent distillation yet. Here, he makes his club-ready approach to historiography clear, crumpling up timelines and sketching out a universe. While particular details change from record to record, Müller’s tunes often harbor a similar feeling: It is heart-on-sleeve and tough at once, every drum landing with an icy precision and each keyboard stretching towards the skies. Even as he pans from one genre to another, that emotive approach serves as his bedrock. His music sits at the intersections of breakbeats, ambient music, and techno; over the years, he’s become so adept behind the boards that any seams are more or less invisible. His catalog is equally suited for basement raves, 4 a.m. highways, and sun-drenched afternoons—pitch the bass accordingly and you’re good to go. Resort takes full advantage of this range, playing like a guided tour of Müller’s catalog, each kick drum landing with the quiet intimacy of a familiar heartbeat. Part of the thrill of Resort is in watching Müller stretch out a bit, exploring new territories by revisiting old traditions. In doing so, he offers up some of his warmest and most inviting music to date, giving his always-precise drum programming a sepia-tinged hue. In its best moments, the LP sounds beamed in from a slightly different universe, one in which Warp and Rephlex never left the mid-’90s and every sample arrived blanketed in a thin layer of dust. “BB Care,” thanks to its ramshackle drums, dreamy synth pads, and barely there vocal samples, feels like a forgotten bonus track from Music Has the Right to Children. “Hölzl Was a Dancer,” a house-music stomper with shuffle-and-skip drums and an acrobatic bassline, might have lit up dancefloors in 1992. The hazy synth workout “Hedwig Transformation Group” recalls GAS at his most blissed-out, while “Waldmeister” displays Müller’s ambient-techno chops, with sun-dappled synthesizers gleaming amid groaning bass. For all its retro-leaning references, Resort is hardly shackled to the past. It is a series of clever and subtle reimaginings, fusing new-school and genre-agnostic approaches to electronic music with vintage textures. (A few track titles—“Nostaglitch,” “Reminiscrmx”—cheekily underline this idea.) Squint and you’ll notice shards of juke and footwork underneath the lullaby-soft synthesizers of “Daytime Gamer,” and “Element,” which sits somewhere between acid, breaks, and ambient music, sounds like something that might play as sun fills the Nowadays dancefloor. Skee Mask has never been an aesthetic purist, exactly—that first SCNTST EP twisted DJ Assault’s speaker-busting “Ass N Titties” into a psychedelic sort-of-techno brain-bender—but he clearly understands the power of tweaking familiar idioms. Resort, with its blissed-out breakbeats, lucid-dream techno, and gauzy downtempo, is both a quiet flex and an ode to umpteen dance-music histories.",0,"June 21, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/skee-mask-resort/
Destroy Lonely,LOVE LASTS FOREVER,4.5,Rap,"Do you remember the days when Destroy Lonely drops felt like certified moments, when his vocals rippled across beats as regal and shimmery as stained glass? Now he’s tossing out barely baked tapes and getting caught up in Twitter beefs. Among Playboi Carti’s Opium label roster, the inventive and goofy Ken Carson increasingly overshadows him. Worst of all, an ex-girlfriend has accused him of physical assault—an allegation he’s denied. At a moment when stars are crashing out every week, Lone’s fall from grace feels particularly precipitous. His new album ditches the dirgelike guitar vibe of last year’s overlong debut, which triggered a tsunami of scorn. It feels like an attempt to reclaim his spot as a cult favorite. LOVE LASTS FOREVER is all flashy beats and sugary vocal sprees. But instead of reviving golden-era Lone, the tape is overloaded with flamboyant flex-rap tropes, as though he’d SparkNoted himself. No song is downright awful; equally, no lyric or hook or vocal run leaves much of an impression. Imagine a Travis Scott album with no features—it’s an airless vault full of the best brags ChatGPT can generate and anonymously elegant instrumentals that shine like knockoff jewelry. The emptiness is frustrating, because Lone clearly wants to create an immersive world for his music. His cover art is always sleekly designed. He directed a short film for his last project. He conceptualizes distinct personas for new albums, assigning himself a nickname for each. On If Looks Could Kill, he was Look Killa; now he’s Baby Money. Yet that’s about as far as his creativity extends—as a branding exercise to make himself appear cool, mysterious, and vaguely artsy. He has the Swiftian impulse to self-mythologize, but his storytelling misses the mark. There’s something almost impressive about the way Lone makes luxury and hedonism sound dreary through repetition. It’s an endless excess-athon of getting head, sipping drank, flying to L.A., popping fits, making million after million after million. Even the title—LOVE LASTS FOREVER—feels pointless, having nothing to do with 95 percent of the album. There are no lovesick croons, no yearning synth flutters, no romantic insights. The beats, almost exclusively produced by Lil 88, are richly textured yet hollow, like royalty-free trap beats gussied up with a blockbuster budget. Even after a dozen listens, you’d still strain to pick any of them out of a lineup. The few that stick in the memory are hypnotic and cosmically uneasy, like “LUV 4 YA,” which has the glacial breeze of an experimental bass tune. It’s one of only a handful that mutates as the track goes on, with drones and keys that mirror the drunken vocals in the bridge. Icy synth slivers tingle the brain on “LOVE HURTS,” which could soundtrack Lone and Lil Uzi Vert catwalking across Pluto in all-black Rick Owens space suits. When Lone boasts, “This ain’t a lifestyle, this just life,” over the madly lurching underworld merry-go-round of “SAY THAT,” you’re almost convinced he has control over the carnival. But then the power cuts out, and it’s back to type beats. When he feels like trying, swift flow shifts and the rare goofy bar liven things up. Yet even his more erratic and energized tonal spasms—the “woo woo” on “SYRUP SIPPIN,” the gruff freakout on “HONESTLY”—feel like ripoffs of Carti and Travis vocal tics. Some of the most thrilling new rappers, like che, make up for feeble writing with constantly morphing, freakily zonked beats. That was once the case for Lone. This time, it feels like he and Lil 88 were cooped up in the studio until they lost all perspective. Does Love Last Forever? is a question Lone could soon be asking his most faithful fans, whose patience may be tested by an album this flat and flavorless.",0,"September 6, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/destroy-lonely-love-lasts-forever/
BabyChiefDoit,ANIMALS ONLY,7.6,Rap,"There’s a new generation of Chicago drill rappers who can hardly remember a time before drill. Just like the scene’s original architects, these are artists of high school age or barely beyond it, and to them, the sound might as well be sewn into the fabric of America. At this point I’m not sure if there’s a metropolitan area in the country without a drill scene, even if they don’t exactly call it that. In many ways, the sound’s migration outside of Chicago’s borders has flattened the music, normalizing the tragedy and losing the specificity of its reference points in local street rap and Atlanta trap. I like some of the offshoots—mainly in New York or over in the DMV—but it does often feel like a trendy way for aspiring rappers to chase internet fame through shock (for example: Jacksonville drill) instead of a direct extension of the groundbreaking, morally complicated genre. You can’t say that about BabyChiefDoit, a drill pupil out of Chicago’s South Side who is messing around with a style that he absorbed through osmosis. He’s been off to the races since July, when he put out “Pancakes & Drugs,” which channels the controlled mayhem of G Herbo’s “Who Run It” flow, even incorporating a Three 6 Mafia sample. BabyChief is a teenager but looks about 12, which I realized when I watched a vlog of him downing a plate of tater tots in an airport. He has a short stature that he embraces like Phife Dawg and Muggsy Bogues. He sometimes strolls around music videos holding a monkey mask and he’s really into the idea of comparing the chaos in his city to the zoo—which, from Ol’ Dirty Bastard to Chief Keef, is nothing new. Naturally, his debut mixtape is called ANIMALS ONLY, a rowdy spree of shit-talk that packs every era of Chicago drill into 12 songs. He’s got all the corners covered. There’s early Chief Keef in the hellish, apocalyptic beats with footwork-fast BPMs, like “Look Up,” where BabyChief’s straightforward drill threats sound backed by a mass of cicadas. The intensity you could hear in that era between Young Pappy and FBG Duck is present in his typically hookless, pedal-to-the-metal raps. He’s absolutely buggin’ out on “EBGDITB”—the mic had to have been covered with saliva. There’s a splash of post-Def Jam Lil Durk in his almost emo sing-raps, a mood that’s evocative on “Drowned” but overly familiar on “Laugh at Em.” Somehow, like YoungBoy’s Cash Money and No Limit-honoring mixtape 3800 Degrees, ANIMALS ONLY threads in its source material so naturally that the obvious homage doesn’t overshadow BabyChiefDoit as a rapper. He’s not cramming it in as if he were studying for the SATs: Drill sounds a part of him. That must be why BabyChief is having so much fun with Animals Only. On “Doit the Best,” he’s randomly babbling in Jamaican patois and whipping out charged-up Waka Flocka “bow” ad-libs, while the distorted, buffering drums echo through the bathroom of a doomy rave. “Zoo Life Blessing” is one of those noirish Gargoyles beats popular in the Philly drill scene and his fast rapping meshes nicely. The nuttiest song on the whole tape is “King of the Jungle,” an audio slasher flick driven by the constant trumpeting of an elephant, a heartracing BPM level-up at the halfway point, and his tortured screams. “Too Slow,” with the loose-lipped Chicagoan Star Bandz, has them in turbo mode over a sinister snap beat. Though it’s undeniably squeamish hearing two teens talk so aggro, they’re a great duo; she’s threatening to smack someone’s mom and his flow has an irresistible bounce. After listening a dozen times in a row I wondered if they were trying to tap into the spirit of one of the classic flamethrowing drill duets, like “Kill Shit” or “Play for Keeps,” though given their age and roots the answer is probably simpler: They’re just rapping.",0,"October 9, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/babychiefdoit-animals-only/
Jamie xx,In Waves,7.3,Electronic,"It’s been almost 10 years since we last heard at length from Jamie xx. 2015’s In Colour took the moody brand of minimalism his band the xx had perfected for a spin on the dancefloor. Since then, he’s scattered a few under-the-radar bits of production work for high-profile artists like Frank Ocean, Miley Cyrus, and Tyler, the Creator, as well as his bandmates’ solo records. In Colour peaked with the Romy feature “Loud Places,” in which she delineates the different reasons people have to go out: to find a lover to go home with, to find a reason to never go home again. And his co-production of Romy’s own “Enjoy Your Life” was a highlight of her 2023 debut, an instant anthem about letting go of the reasons why and embracing pleasure. The writer and nightlife scholar McKenzie Wark opens her classic book Raving with a statement of purpose. “First thing I look for at raves: who needs it.” Tracks like these offered a defense of this need and a depiction of it. They felt, they feel, essential. The pleasure of the dancefloor also animates his album-length return. In Waves generally plays to his strengths. These include simplicity: “Still Summer” is essentially a filtered trance chord progression, a kickdrum, and some screams; “The Feeling I Get From You” sets a collaged profession of love above some piano bar tinklings and an electro-y beat. Both are class acts. He also has a top-drawer guestlist, both sampled and in-person. His collab with the Avalanches brings the legendary poet Nikki Giovanni to the party via lifted stanzas of her Black Arts Movement “Dance Poem,” and if, like me, you might not necessarily have been the target audience for her 1976 calling-in of revolutionary children, the track’s psychedelic pop groove is welcoming nonetheless. “Baddy on the Floor” brings in the iconic Honey Dijon for a gospel-house stormer, easily the most vital track of the bunch. And “Life” lets Robyn, that disco bard of mixed emotions, rip. “Let’s fuck it up tonight,” she commands over French-touched house, and who would say no? Music sounds better with her. Even at its strangest—the poesy comedown of closer “Falling Together” or the electroclash freakout of “Dafodil,” in which Kelsey Lu, John Glacier, Panda Bear, and also A$AP Rocky get lost on a hot summer night—Waves is bigger than In Colour, in the spectacle of its sound and in the scope of possible audience. This is music that can be effortlessly slotted into mainstream house sets and diced into TikTok challenges, selected as soundtracks for your vacation Insta carousels and added to “memories of 2024” playlists. Nothing succeeds in dance music like dance music about dancing, and on that front, In Waves is the big time. And yet the stakes feel small. The breakbeat techno “Breather” soundtracks an attempt to stave off a panic attack, but its limp mindfulness mantras and the “French Kiss”-style slowdown at the center keep the track from feeling bodied. Opener “Wanna” attempts a grand swoon that’s more of a gentle sway, though its little bits of glissando might well give a shiver and its bass is EQ’d for maximum impact. In the expert machinations, there’s a certain slightness. When feeling out what’s missing, it helps to look at what’s been there the whole time. “Waited All Night” finally gets the band back together, and Romy and Oliver Sim are in fine, melancholy voice. “Don’t want to peak too soon,” Romy sings, as the track layers Sasha & Digweed-style ’90s progressive house, the bassline hedonism of millennium UK garagers like Shanks & Bigfoot, the sonic chemtrails of his contemporaries like Bambounou and Peverelist, and even a brief threat of gabber towards the end. He’s got the plugs to the power sources of the last 60 years of dance music at his fingertips. “Would you want to feel it?” Romy asks. And yes of course—that’s why we’re here, on this dancefloor, together. That’s what we need, the peak, that moment of awkwardness and risk and the euphoria that feels like an eternity and comes and goes in an instant. In Waves promises these moments. Literally, in the hammered samples throughout 2-step-y “Treat Each Other Right,” which arrives with the bravado of prime Basement Jaxx (or, lately, Overmono or Two Shell) and the nu-PLUR politics of Octo Octa and Eris Drew and then sinks under the weight of its own protestations of eternal love and devotion. Dance music about dancing works when it inspires movement; dance music about love only works when you can’t help but sink in. Remember when the Idris Muhammad sample swells like a first, best kiss, in Romy’s “Loud Places”? You’ll never forget it, unlike a fair bit of In Waves, which is tasteful and slick, approachable and antiperspirant, less oceanic ecstasy than the pool party of the year.

Various Artists,I Saw the TV Glow (Original Soundtrack),7.1,,"Art and youth form unshakeable bonds in I Saw the TV Glow, director Jane Schoenbrun’s melancholy and claustrophobic document of suburban outsiderdom. Schoenbrun has spoken in interviews about how, as a child, they opted to process their identity through fiction rather than “actually look in the mirror and figure out who I was.” With I Saw the TV Glow, they put a surreal spin on the way beloved cultural objects give us an outlet for hard-to-express feelings. At the heart of the film—the director’s first since their acclaimed loner internet horror We’re All Going to the World’s Fair—are two teenage characters obsessed with the mysteries and mythos of The Pink Opaque, a weekly half-hour monster-of-the-week TV show in the campily terrifying vein of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The X-Files. Watching the show, the characters find an outlet for their feelings of isolation—and as the borders between their physical existence and the world of The Pink Opaque melt, they eventually come to wonder if their memories of the series might be more real than reality. The soundtrack seems designed to provoke similarly intense reactions among its listeners. In addition to a ghostly score from Alex G—who returns after his work on We’re All Going to the World’s Fair—the film features a robust collection of original songs from artists that inspire feverish fandom not unlike the characters’ obsession with The Pink Opaque. Collecting tracks from hushed singer-songwriters (Florist, Maria BC), fuzz-scuffed indie-rock artists (Bartees Strange, Jay Som), and off-kilter pop acts (Caroline Polachek, yeule), it feels moody and homespun, a sure recipe for cultish devotion—like a CD-R with a tracklist written in Sharpie, passed around a group of friends amid reverent whispers. The film is firmly rooted in the imagery and cultural touchstones of the 1990s—characters muse about the looks of Evan Dando and Michael Stipe, and posters for Sarah Records are pinned to their walls. And though the soundtrack is full of artists from the 2020s, most of them reach for sounds that evoke the end of the 20th century. Jay Som’s “If I Could” is lit by a gleaming guitar riff that chimes as brightly as Bandwagonesque. Sadurn’s slide-guitar-smeared “How Can I Get Out?” plays like a hazy memory of the mellower songwriters on Drag City in the ’90s. Even Polachek sidelines her sleek synth-pop contortions in favor of anthemic shoegaze on “Starburned and Unkissed.” Though the reference points are clear, the songs never feel too reverential—they’re often loose and deliberately otherworldly, as if heard in the depths of a dream. That approach is clearest on yeule’s cover of Broken Social Scene’s “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl.” On its surface, it’s a gloomy trailercore rendition of a song that’s long been an unofficial hymn for teenaged outcasts—an especially on-the-nose choice to kick off a film about adolescent alienation. But underneath the track’s heavy-lidded surface is something stranger: a distant memory of the original, scoured by glitches, with vocals that slip and swirl around the meditative backing track. Where Broken Social Scene’s recording is rhythmically locked in and mantra-like, yeule’s version is distant and dissociative, a bedridden memory of adolescence long since passed. The soundtrack’s most sweeping emotional gesture, yeule’s song also offers the most vivid illustration of the film’s delight in bending linear time. Both I Saw the TV Glow and its soundtrack begin in ways that feel familiar and nostalgic before diving back into the shadows, rendering beloved youthful memories unrecognizably strange.",0,"May 11, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-i-saw-the-tv-glow-original-soundtrack/
Seefeel,Everything Squared,8.0,Electronic / Rock,"When new sounds from Seefeel last filtered in, they sounded older than ever. Mark Clifford, Sarah Peacock, and various collaborators had, for some two decades, distilled the aquatic shoegaze rave of early classics like 1993’s Quique into the minerally syrup of 1995’s Succour, the chemical fumes of the following year’s (Ch-Vox) and then, finally, the brilliant and parched sediment of 2011’s Seefeel, so bright you had to squint at it. By that point, their grooves were more dust than dub. The timeless now of their long, lovely songs had faded into unstable memories, and then acts of remembering, via fascinating reissues in packages that felt like terminal excavations. Which makes Everything Squared, Seefeel’s mini-album of new recordings, such an unexpected joy. It’s not just that Clifford has figured out a route back to the old ways, although, blissfully, he has; nor simply that there’s still an audience for such endeavors. The pleasure of this half hour lies in its optimism—its faith that so much can be made of so little, still. “Lose the Minus,” for example, offers only the essential: a simple bass tone that manages to both defy gravity and trace its effects; a whisper of melody; Peacock’s voice, glistening with a simple FX gloss. A guitar vibrates, then crests. It’s over. It’s enough. While equally brief, “End of Here” is sort of its opposite, an exercise in fullness made of fuzz and decay. It’s almost too much, then it leaves you alone. Elsewhere, Clifford and Peacock let themselves stretch. The beguiling “Hooked Paw” swaps out the band’s sonar blips for crunchy building blocks that tumble into thick, bassy depths. Seefeel are not exactly a funky band, but they swing more than they’re given credit for. And with its scratched, metallic frame, “Antiskeptic” reminds you that Seefeel’s roots are as much industrial as ambient. The crooking rhythm is a kind of window through which bright streaks of synths arch and scatter. Occasionally, trance chords flash like artificial lightning. The world-building creates tension. Seefeel’s early now becomes what will happen next? Peacock’s voice often answers that question. She belongs in the pantheon of vocalists—from peers like Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell and My Bloody Valentine’s Bilinda Butcher to contemporary wonders like Beach House’s Victoria Legrand and more eaze and L’Rain, and of course the miraculous Elizabeth Fraser—who figure out ways to sing without always forming words. Instead, Peacock makes moments. In “Hooked Paw,” a murmur becomes a hall of mirrors. In opener “Sky Hooks,” her voice is the star, shining front and center in an arrangement of foggy bass, swooping pads, and crowds of sizzling noise and chimes that gather to form the track’s climax before vanishing into echoes. Peacock offers navigation and, maybe, even a kind of narrative to follow. Seefeel have always used vocals the way other bands used feedback or percussion, and Everything Squared highlight “Multifolds” shows the wisdom of that choice, even as it indulges in a bit of nostalgia. Its hook is a bit of what’s probably guitar, a little flicker of notes that calls directly back to fan favorites like “Plainsong.” Peacock shows off her range with a high call that floats around ripples of her whispering, mid-register sighing, and other airy sounds that play hide-and-seek with the skittering percussion. In the same way the band’s first records felt like off-kilter interpretations of, say, King Tubby and krautrock, these new ones recast, not retread, what we’ve already heard. Seefeel have still got it, and are still finding new things to do with it. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

2300,Bully,7.1,Rap,"Boozy all-nighters at Queens strip clubs, a lifetime’s worth of thirsty DMs, maybe a little tricking on the side. This is Bully, a hangout R&B mixtape by soft-spoken loverboy 2300 that’s full of jacked beats and self-produced remixes pulling from pining ’90s soul and pop charts past and present. Hosted by DJ Bandsome Will, doing a pretty good vintage DJ Clue impression, Bully is a low-stakes, boys-night-out blur. Scribbled into less than 30 minutes of half-completed songs and slick-tongued freestyles is a story of tryna’ get laid in the deep outer boroughs of New York in your twenties. The sample-heavy production and girls, girls, girls mentality will draw comparisons to Cash Cobain and Chow Lee’s “sexy drill,” but 2300’s sound is gentler and less outrageous. He’s more about the details of the chase than the fucking, though there is plenty of that, too. As a producer first and foremost, 2300—raised in Laurelton, a residential area of Queens a short drive from Long Island—started out cooking up beats for NYC drill stars like DThang, Sleepy Hallow, and Pop Smoke, as well as contributing a track to Chlöe Bailey’s solo debut In Pieces. I didn’t know he sang until this summer when I saw him open for Harlem’s R2R Moe at Baby’s All Right in Williamsburg. The intimate venue was shoulder-to-shoulder and he took the stage with a nervous blush. Hyped up by his friends, he busted out a hushed ballad called “Leg of My Life” without much help from the backing track. Loaded up with New York-specific lingo and a cloudy atmosphere informed by The-Dream, it’s been one of my favorite R&B songs of the year ever since. The best stuff on Bully builds off “Leg of My Life” with low-key speak-sing melodies and calm beats that seem like they would be in a Morris Chestnut rom-com if not for the jittery drums. On “She Ain’t Rlly Like Dat SMH,” his casual vocals curl around the slow groove as he’s gutted to learn that his new crush isn’t a freak: “I like hood girls, I like women knowing that they could throw it anywhere.” In his lyrics he tends to admit things other guys would be too cool to mention. “I’m a trick baby you don’t gotta trick me,” he sings on “She Wanna Go Meet Kelz,” then rewinds the line a few times to hammer home the point. He also spices up his flow by sucking his teeth between bars, a stylistic quirk that helps make up for the fact that his singing won’t blow you away. Possibly because of those vocal limitations, 2300 seems hesitant to fully commit to the hip-hop soul sound he’s grazing against. He tries to play it off like he’s not trying that hard with annoyingly unfinished tracks like “Crash Da Whip,” while the tape’s weakest songs (“Highlight Room,” “Botelle”) veer toward “sexy drill,” an unnecessary safety net. But not every R&B artist needs to have climbed the ranks of their church choir to be considered good. His everyman smooth-talk is compelling whether he’s yearning like he’s signed to LaFace in the mid ’90s on the way-too-short “Dey Don’t Know” or lustful like he’s trying to decide who to ask for a lapdance on the club-ready “Chat.” His sample-based beats have a knack for opening up unexpected crevices (notably, the tick-tocking percussion of “Problem”) while keeping the energy light and unserious: just right for this tipsy, game-spitting New York mood piece.",0,"October 3, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2300-bully/
Art Brut,"A Record Collection, Reduced to a Mixtape / And Yes, This Is My Singing Voice!",7.0,"Rock Reviewed: July 9, 2024 In the Rebel Alliance to resurrect Real Rock’n’Roll, Art Brut frontman Eddie Argos viewed himself as Luke Skywalker. How else are we meant to interpret one particular live version of the band’s 2007 single “Pump Up the Volume,” which opens with John Williams’ Star Wars title theme before the horns crash into the song’s swaggering first notes? When Art Brut first met in 2002, at a party hosted by short-lived London indie darlings Ciccone, NME’s number-one ranked album was Coldplay’s A Rush of Blood to the Head. The early aughts post-punk revival was bursting at the seams (Interpol’s Turn on the Bright Lights came out the same year), but the pop charts could barely manage a distortion pedal. British music media was similarly fractured—BBC’s Top of the Pops was sprinting towards its swan song, while NME and Kerrang! struggled to adapt to the velocity of new online-only publications. Armed with Argos’, well, brute sprechgesang and wielding their guitars like battle axes, Art Brut painted themselves as the saviors of a dying scene. On two new compilations titled after lyrics, the 2xLP A Record Collection, Reduced to a Mixtape and the 5xCD box set And Yes, This Is My Singing Voice!, Art Brut assemble their studio recordings, B-sides, and a handful of electrifying live cuts that argue that the scene, in turn, saved them. In the nearly 20 years since the band’s debut, 2005’s Bang Bang Rock & Roll, it seems painfully clear that Argos has failed to write “the song that makes Israel and Palestine get along,” or to pen the next “Happy Birthday,” as he declared on “Formed a Band.” But Art Brut’s influence on contemporary indie rock has only grown since their last album, 2018’s Wham! Bang! Pow! Let’s Rock Out!. The echo of Argos’ cocksure yet self-aware monotone can be heard in Joe Casey’s tortured soliloquies for Protomartyr, the deadpan nonsequiturs of Dry Cleaning’s Florence Shaw, or the fever-pitch rants of Idles’ Joe Talbot. And while the band’s lyrical themes—falling in love with girls, starting a band to make out with girls, loving music more than making out—appear provincial compared to their politically minded disciples, Argos’ contemptuous streak has resurfaced in a recent crop of British bands like Yard Act and Squid. These newer groups might couch their music in the alienation of late capitalism, but fundamentally, they’re asking the same question that Argos barked back in 2005: “Why don’t our parents worry about us?” This isn’t the first time Art Brut have revisited their past. In 2013, they released a “best of” collection, Top of the Pops, named after both the band’s 2004 song and the show on which they’d never have the chance to perform. For the casual Art Brut fan, there isn’t much added value on these new releases. The first few songs on both the LP and CD sets mirror the Top of the Pops tracklist almost exactly, opening with “Formed a Band,” “My Little Brother,” and “Emily Kane.” Instead, this collection is both an introduction for potential new fans who were still in primary school during the band’s peak, and on the other end, an overdue celebration for Art Brut obsessives, who will doubtlessly appreciate the frenetic live recordings included here. At the time of its release, Argos used Top of the Pops to prematurely anoint Art Brut a “CLASSIC ROCK BAND” (they had been on the front cover of German Rolling Stone, after all), and projected that their “Next phase is HERITAGE ROCK BAND. See you in 10 years for a Second Volume.” It took a little longer, but Art Brut have returned to cement their status: being a Heritage Rock Band usually requires leaving some sort of lasting physical legacy. For Argos’ teeth-gnashing musical protagonist, discovering rock’n’roll was the first step in a futile quest—electric guitars evoked a world of declining relevance and unfulfilled potential. But it was hard to tell how much of the band was an act. Was their bassist’s name really Freddy Feedback? What about first guitarist Chris Chinchilla? How serious was Argos when he sang “popular culture no longer applies to me,” and how much was a deflection from his own insecurities as a songwriter? These box sets suggest that both can be true: Art Brut sound at the peak of their powers performing live, darting frantically across the fretboard and drumkit at the French festival Eurockéennes in 2006. At that show’s rendition of “Bad Weekend,” Argos justified his anger as he begged his audience to write books and make films: “You can’t complain about it unless you’re doing something about it!” Without the band behind him, he seemed to say, he’d be just another guy whining about art after one too many lagers. The outlandish confidence of Art Brut’s debut, which seemed to demand critical success by sheer force of will, wasn’t born in a vacuum. On these box sets, we hear Argos’ journey to overcompensatory arrogance: On an early version of “Formed a Band,” one of several “Brutleg” demo tapes, he sounds almost bashful as he dryly explains, “And yes, this is my singing voice—it’s not irony, it’s not rock and roll.” All the pieces are there on the first take of “Modern Art”—guitars that build like a structure fire, wild screams that echo behind Argos as he screams, “Modern art makes me want to rock OUT!”—but he hadn’t quite mastered the authoritarian sneer he wields on the final version. The demos, though skippable for the average post-punk fan, are both humbling and humanizing, a crack in the assertive facade the band projected onto its albums and live shows. When Argos sang “We make pop music,” on a song by the same name, he wasn’t describing the sound of the mainstream charts. He meant pop as in “popular,” and he wanted Art Brut to be the biggest band on Earth. These proclamations feel misaligned to the current pop landscape, where cult-like fanbases persist in the absence of actual hits (and even a smash doesn’t guarantee loyal customers). Art Brut came to life in an ecosystem that felt, comparatively, diverse: more blogs, more labels, more DIY venues—more access to music than ever before. It only makes Art Brut’s trajectory feel more tragic, their later albums supplanting delusions of grandeur with petty scene squabbles (“He dresses like he came free with the NME,” he sneered on 2011’s “Bad Comedian”) hidden behind a veil of sarcasm. These reissues recall a recent past that felt more meritocratic, where one glowing blog post or energetic late-night TV performance could break a band. In our tangled post-streaming landscape, Art Brut’s dogged belief in their own greatness seems like a balm against entrenched pop hierarchies. “No more songs about sex and drugs and rock and roll, it’s boring,” Argos sang on the debut album’s title track.

And while the band’s lyrical themes—falling in love with girls, starting a band to make out with girls, loving music more than making out—appear provincial compared to their politically minded disciples, Argos’ contemptuous streak has resurfaced in a recent crop of British bands like Yard Act and Squid. These newer groups might couch their music in the alienation of late capitalism, but fundamentally, they’re asking the same question that Argos barked back in 2005: “Why don’t our parents worry about us?” This isn’t the first time Art Brut have revisited their past. In 2013, they released a “best of” collection, Top of the Pops, named after both the band’s 2004 song and the show on which they’d never have the chance to perform. For the casual Art Brut fan, there isn’t much added value on these new releases. The first few songs on both the LP and CD sets mirror the Top of the Pops tracklist almost exactly, opening with “Formed a Band,” “My Little Brother,” and “Emily Kane.” Instead, this collection is both an introduction for potential new fans who were still in primary school during the band’s peak, and on the other end, an overdue celebration for Art Brut obsessives, who will doubtlessly appreciate the frenetic live recordings included here. At the time of its release, Argos used Top of the Pops to prematurely anoint Art Brut a “CLASSIC ROCK BAND” (they had been on the front cover of German Rolling Stone, after all), and projected that their “Next phase is HERITAGE ROCK BAND. See you in 10 years for a Second Volume.” It took a little longer, but Art Brut have returned to cement their status: being a Heritage Rock Band usually requires leaving some sort of lasting physical legacy. For Argos’ teeth-gnashing musical protagonist, discovering rock’n’roll was the first step in a futile quest—electric guitars evoked a world of declining relevance and unfulfilled potential. But it was hard to tell how much of the band was an act. Was their bassist’s name really Freddy Feedback? What about first guitarist Chris Chinchilla? How serious was Argos when he sang “popular culture no longer applies to me,” and how much was a deflection from his own insecurities as a songwriter? These box sets suggest that both can be true: Art Brut sound at the peak of their powers performing live, darting frantically across the fretboard and drumkit at the French festival Eurockéennes in 2006. At that show’s rendition of “Bad Weekend,” Argos justified his anger as he begged his audience to write books and make films: “You can’t complain about it unless you’re doing something about it!” Without the band behind him, he seemed to say, he’d be just another guy whining about art after one too many lagers. The outlandish confidence of Art Brut’s debut, which seemed to demand critical success by sheer force of will, wasn’t born in a vacuum. On these box sets, we hear Argos’ journey to overcompensatory arrogance: On an early version of “Formed a Band,” one of several “Brutleg” demo tapes, he sounds almost bashful as he dryly explains, “And yes, this is my singing voice—it’s not irony, it’s not rock and roll.” All the pieces are there on the first take of “Modern Art”—guitars that build like a structure fire, wild screams that echo behind Argos as he screams, “Modern art makes me want to rock OUT!”—but he hadn’t quite mastered the authoritarian sneer he wields on the final version. The demos, though skippable for the average post-punk fan, are both humbling and humanizing, a crack in the assertive facade the band projected onto its albums and live shows. When Argos sang “We make pop music,” on a song by the same name, he wasn’t describing the sound of the mainstream charts. He meant pop as in “popular,” and he wanted Art Brut to be the biggest band on Earth. These proclamations feel misaligned to the current pop landscape, where cult-like fanbases persist in the absence of actual hits (and even a smash doesn’t guarantee loyal customers). Art Brut came to life in an ecosystem that felt, comparatively, diverse: more blogs, more labels, more DIY venues—more access to music than ever before. It only makes Art Brut’s trajectory feel more tragic, their later albums supplanting delusions of grandeur with petty scene squabbles (“He dresses like he came free with the NME,” he sneered on 2011’s “Bad Comedian”) hidden behind a veil of sarcasm. These reissues recall a recent past that felt more meritocratic, where one glowing blog post or energetic late-night TV performance could break a band. In our tangled post-streaming landscape, Art Brut’s dogged belief in their own greatness seems like a balm against entrenched pop hierarchies. “No more songs about sex and drugs and rock and roll, it’s boring,” Argos sang on the debut album’s title track. If only he’d known how much worse it could get. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Bon Iver,,7.8,Rock,"For over 15 years, Justin Vernon’s music has proven boundless. His 2007 debut as Bon Iver, For Emma, Forever Ago, arrived as falsetto-filled folk shrouded in irresistible mythology—he recorded the album alone in the Wisconsin wilderness, heartbroken and recovering from illness. But just as a generation of songwriters started mimicking his signature woodsy sound, Vernon had moved on to the next thing, then the next: a post-rock side project; a Grammy-winning chamber pop record; then, in 2016, the experimental 22, A Million, whose vocoded vocals, glitchy synths, and spectral arrangements reimagined Bon Iver as a project unburdened by genre or era. By 2019, when the band released i,i, Vernon was widely considered a generational genius, an artist’s artist, an innovator of the highest order. It seemed there was nothing he couldn’t do. After nearly two decades of reinvention and obfuscation, Vernon now seems set on becoming more direct. After initially spurning the spotlight, he’s embraced his role as an advocate for social change, releasing singles with corresponding mission statements and promoting partnerships with gender equity and domestic violence prevention organizations during his live shows; recently, he performed in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz at a Wisconsin rally. His collaborations have also become less outré and more straightforward. Rather than freestyle alongside Chief Keef and Assassin on wily Kanye West album cuts, he’s dueting pop standards with Taylor Swift and Zach Bryan. Each Bon Iver release used to mark a rip in time, opening a portal into uncharted musical possibility. But on SABLE, his latest EP, Vernon forgoes the transformative for the nakedly plain, showing how revelatory his songs remain even when they’re stripped down to their elements. SABLE, is not a “return to form,” though, a term some critics have been eager to deploy. Less indebted to For Emma and its follow-up EP, Blood Bank, the songs on SABLE, are more extensions of i,i and Big Red Machine’s 2021 album How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last?, with Vernon’s belly-rich baritone and sinuous falsetto towering over fingerpicked guitar and gentle string arrangements. But while i,i was rooted in musical collaboration and lyrical explorations of forgiveness and togetherness, SABLE, finds a siloed Vernon sorting through self-hatred and disappointment. On “THINGS BEHIND THINGS BEHIND THINGS,” he seeks reprieve from his brooding mind. “I would like the feeling/I would like the feeling/I would like the feeling gone,” he sings in a descending cadence. The refrain that there are “things behind things” can be understood as either expansive or despairing: beauty behind pain, trust behind betrayal—or suffering behind suffering, a cyclical torture with no bottom. Vernon’s writing has always thrived in these liminal spaces, where meaning can shift from listener to listener. And though the song never soars into transcendence or dares to get weird—hallmarks of Bon Iver’s best work—its repetition and stagnancy are themselves meaningful. “I am afraid of changing,” Vernon admits, as a pedal steel sneaks in behind his voice. Vernon still knows how to write a transcendent song, though, as he does with “S P E Y S I D E.” Apart from his duets with Swift, it’s the crispest and cleanest his singing has ever sounded. Unadorned and unprocessed, his voice lilts and howls, bends and breaks. His writing, impressionistic as ever, captures a bleak, hopeless state: “I know now that I can’t make good/How I wish I could.” The acoustic guitar, bright enough to banish the sadness, creates a striking interplay with Vernon’s aching falsetto. But it’s not until “AWARDS SEASON” that the sorrow breaks open into something new—resiliency, rebirth. A sound like howling wind is pitched behind Vernon, the song patiently building out with piano and cavernous synths, a pedal steel stalking behind a collage of saxophones. “I can handle way more than I can handle,” goes the opening line, which has managed to cut me in half each time I hear it. In a 2004 interview with 60 Minutes, Bob Dylan was asked if he was still able to write songs as well as he once did. With a pained expression, he replied, “You can’t do something forever. I did it once and I can do other things now, but I can’t do that.” As I listened to SABLE, I couldn’t stop thinking about this clip. Dylan, of course, still had great work in him, including a late-career masterpiece. Maybe he could no longer conjure the magic of his past, but he could conjure something else, a different type of magic altogether. Similarly, SABLE, distills the familiar pleasures of Vernon’s extraordinary oeuvre while providing a singular magic all its own—one of refinement and maturation, of clarity and confidence. It’s hard to imagine him not doing this forever.",0,"October 18, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bon-iver-sable-ep/
Joan Shelley,Mood Ring EP,7.4,Folk/Country,"Before the body kept score, the mood ring promised to illuminate the interior. There was never any science behind these dime-store trinkets, yet their charm lives on. Sure, the shifts in color are just a thermochromic reaction to body temperature, but what if their rainbow reactions happened to exactly reflect how you were feeling at that moment—or cast a tiny opaline window into some as-yet unrealized emotion? The hope of being seen, the magic of it, even, is potent and irresistible—and it’s something that Joan Shelley is especially gifted at. On the Mood Ring EP, the Kentucky folk songwriter’s first release in two years, she is deeply attuned to the unnamed people around her and how to best meet their needs. She intuits someone’s “swirling purple tint” on the title track and invites them to a party. “Singing to you has never worked,” she hymns warmly on “Singing to You,” presumably of her young daughter’s nursery-rhyme preferences, recognizing instead that it’s “better just to row the boat/To a hum/No words at all/To keep you from you.” The closing song is called “I Look After You.” Care has long radiated through this still-underrated musician’s work. Shelley has the kind of bright and clear voice that brims with tenderness and patience, which also means that any forces that threaten to unsettle those traits immediately register within it. She and her husband, Nathan Salsburg, share a collaborative sensibility, interest in vernacular music, and quality control level similar to those of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings. (After they met and found their sound, Shelley has said, “I was like, we are Joan Shelley, and he was like, I’m cool with that.”) Musician James Elkington often rounds out their partnership, the three of them sharing a comfortingly intuitive bond and creating places you may want to stay a while. Elkington produced Shelley’s 2022 album The Spur, her most ambitious and wide-ranging record to date. But Mood Ring has no named producer and is a far simpler affair, with a small and subtly arranged ensemble used to striking effect. Understated doesn’t mean lacking in complexity. “Singing to You” is essentially a devotional to a child, but the minor-chord weave of shuffling percussion, pealing fiddle, and gentle invigoration is no simple balm. There are what initially seem like moments of pure sweetness in the lilting, loving pendulum swing of “Mood Ring” and “I Look After You,” with its kalimba lullaby plink. But the former, inspired by Shelley’s reading about block universe theory—in which past, present, and future exist simultaneously—ends with her singing, with a shrug, “Relationships die/That’s how we move through time.” The latter seems as much an offering to the living as to something lost, “Your scent/Telling you once lived/In my sun.” Her consolations don’t seem to work so well when pointed inward. “Seven Steps,” which could easily pass for a traditional British folk song, is guided by an ominous harmonium drone as Shelley focuses hard on clipped verses about putting one foot in front of the other after some period of difficulty and dislocation. The simplest song, “Fire in the Morning,” is just her voice and loping nylon-string guitar: a sort of gorgeously absent-minded laundry-day melody whose images of loss, grief, and the foolishness of trying to “plant a tree in winter” hit all the harder for its unassuming qualities. “And here I’m offering melody/And it’s sad in tone in hopes you’ll hear it,” she sings. Listen carefully, and what may seem like a small, sweet set of songs reveals a range of color that speaks to Shelley’s remarkable sensitivity.",0,"October 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joan-shelley-mood-ring-ep/
Coldplay,Moon Music,6.0,Rock,"Coldplay treat every album like it’s their last, and since X&Y, they’ve been threatening to end their career. “Bands shouldn’t go past 33,” a then 31-year-old Chris Martin said after Viva la Vida. A Head Full of Dreams was also “the end of something.” Now, at 47, Martin is finally serious, with a concrete plan for two more albums after their latest, Moon Music. Coldplay’s music may have stagnated in recent years, but consistent releases have fueled their emergence as titans of the concert industry. Their Mylo Xyloto shows were the first to widely deploy the LED wristbands that are now staples at Taylor Swift shows, and their Music of the Spheres tour brought innovations in sustainability, like “kinetic dancefloors” enabling the audience to generate energy for the concert. That magic-of-music whimsy is why their live show is so beloved and their studio records so reviled. It’s hard to see the dark side of life when an audience’s joy literally powers you. Take the audience away, and it’s a bit dicier. With track titles including “🌈” and “GOOD FEELiNGS,” Moon Music has already been dubbed the “most ‘Coldplay’ Coldplay album,” but what that means has changed as the band has transitioned from melancholic balladeers to starry-eyed stadium behemoths. They’ve escalated so much—looking at the stars to traversing the galaxy—that naming an album for the moon is scaling back. Claiming a middle ground between the streamlined pop of Music of the Spheres and the eclecticism of Everyday Life, Moon Music demonstrates all the reasons to be sick of Coldplay, and all the reasons they’ll be missed when they retire for real. Though Max Martin is again at the helm, Moon Music sounds like the work of a band for the first time since Viva La Vida. That might seem faint praise, but Coldplay are at their best as a four-person unit rather than Martin & Martin. When Chris is the only audible member until the obligatory Jonny Buckland guitar licks on the outro (a formula repeated on “Magic,” “Higher Power,” and “Something Just Like This”) the effect is faceless; when all four hit like the fine-tuned stadium band they’ve become, it’s much harder to resist. Look at the lyrics of “iAAM” and laugh when Martin compares himself to a mountain and a Greek god, then try not to pump your fist when that trademark upright piano sound announces the chorus. Even “Man in the Moon,” from the deluxe version, gets away with its tinny Buggles rip by unashamedly doubling down on youth-group call-and-response silliness. That silliness puts Coldplay out of touch with a pop zeitgeist enamored by wit; it’s also made them bigger than almost any artist in the world. In interviews surrounding the record, Martin’s on defense, eloquent (if still naive) about embracing “uncoolness.” “If you were allowed to be yourself, would the world be as aggressive as it is?” he asked The New Yorker’s Amanda Petrusich: “I think much of the violence and conflict [in the world] comes from repression, suppression, and unreleased damage.” That’s all the justification Coldplay need to indulge in childlike wonder. But big emotions needn’t mean simple ones, and childlike wonder doesn’t have to mean regressing to the most banal possible sentiments. That’s when there are sentiments: The words heard most often on this album are “la la,” and around half the songs end in a wordless singalong. When Martin sings, “La-la-lay/That’s all, all I can say” on penultimate track “All My Love,” he’s practically daring someone to go, yes, Chris, we know! When Coldplay remember their strengths, they wind up with their best material in years. “Jupiter” is a genuinely lovely ode to a woman discovering her affection for other women: It’s thoughtful in a way Coldplay haven’t been in a long time, the rare post-Ghost Stories song to successfully return to the intimacy of their early work. (“Don’t give up” means more when it’s sung to one person than to 80,000.) “Aeterna” sidelines lyrics for an ambient dance shuffle, as bassist Guy Berryman takes precedence over Martin’s digitally altered falsetto. With a backbeat lifted from jazz eccentric Louis Cole’s “Weird Part of the Night,” it’s the kind of stylistic detour that makes you wonder why they’re still recruiting the Chainsmokers to co-write a song called “GOOD FEELiNGS.” That unpredictable quality control makes Coldplay frustrating to defend or dismiss—for every questionable choice, there’s a 6-minute nu-jazz vamp or classical prog-pop opus waiting around the corner. Only Coldplay would make a song called “🌈,” but only Coldplay would make it the record’s most beautiful and exploratory song, too. What starts as another “Fix You” retread gradually becomes blissful, as if Martin had been listening to Cocteau Twins and Sigur Rós while making Parachutes instead of Jeff Buckley. So it’s all the more aggravating when a song like “We Pray” fails to live up to its potential. Some of its choices are courageous: a feature from Palestinian Chilean artist Elyanna and a name-drop of the Iranian protest song “Baraye.” Burna Boy and Little Simz do their best with soulful guest appearances. But “We Pray” is once again padded out with “la la”s and simple sentiments, so overstuffed that there are two alternate versions with different verses. The production falls completely flat: There are Imagine Dragons songs with harder-hitting 808s. At their best, Coldplay are capable of things no other act of their size can pull off. There’s just enough charm on Moon Music to demonstrate why they’ve lasted this long, why no misbegotten hip-hop exercise or clunky lyric can stop their reign. Another bonus track, “The Karate Kid,” is as good a plaintitive ballad as any they’ve written. The lyrics are still nonsense on paper, and it’s hard to know whether the song’s “Daniel” is an original character or the actual protagonist of The Karate Kid. But the specifics don’t matter: The song is a rare moment when Martin sits with a loved one’s pain instead of trying to fix it, and so the inevitable lines about making dreams come true feel earned. Or in the parlance of late-era Coldplay: They still remember that there’s 🌧️ before the 🌈. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Lechuga Zafiro,Desde Los Oídos de un Sapo,7.7,Electronic,"If the voice is the original instrument, as avant-garde composer Joan La Barbara once put it, then perhaps frogs are the original synthesizer. Is there another creature on the planet capable of generating more brain-scramblingly otherworldly sounds? Just consider the recordings that Dutch researcher Felix Hess made in Australia and Mexico in the 1980s: His subjects’ expansive array of growling, clicking, and zapping could give the fanciest modular setup a run for its money. Frogs feature prominently in the work of Uruguayan electronic musician Lechuga Zafiro, a.k.a. Pablo de Vargas: Six years after he released a song called “Sapo Diablo,” or “Devil Toad,” he delves deeper into amphibian imagery with his debut album, Desde Los Oídos de un Sapo (From the Ears of a Toad). The title isn’t merely metaphorical: The album’s spellbinding sound design was made in part using field recordings of toads—along with the sounds of birds, pigs, sea lions, water, metal, wood, rock, glass, and plastic. De Vargas’ sound-gathering, carried out across South and Central America, China, and Portugal, yields a bracingly original palette with unusual heft. His drums frequently have the thwack of hollowed-out logs; in “Tero Sex (Danza Para Piedra Volcánica y Tero),” they suggest stones being struck, while slapback reverb creates the claustrophobic impression of being deep in a cave. Splashing liquid assumes rhythmic forms in “Agua de Vidrio,” recalling the water drumming of the Baka people of Cameroon and Gabon—combined, perhaps, with the clang of a blacksmith’s shop. But with rare exceptions, it’s never clear where any given sound may have come from, and de Vargas delights in using digital processes to smear and distort the sounds of nature into unrecognizable shapes. The end result feels a little bit like standing in a holodeck whose screen is falling in jagged shards. It’s not just Lechuga Zafiro’s sounds that are original. Nothing here falls neatly under the umbrella of any established subgenre. Track after track—and sometimes measure by measure—he seems determined to rewrite the rules of club music. “Oreja Ácida” opens the album with lumbering stop-start triplet patterns, then explodes into hyperspeed drum breaks. “Botellharpa” stretches a pitch-bent sample of harp, or maybe guitar, over a quick-stepping, dembow-propelled 4/4 groove, using pockets of silence and queasy glissandi to wreak havoc on the rolling flow. Lechuga Zafiro’s percussive patterns would be plenty powerful even if programmed using conventional drum sounds, or simply banged out on sticks. But they’re all the more compelling for the way that unfamiliar timbres fuse with knotty rhythms. The movements of his beats feel dictated by the physical resistance of three-dimensional objects pushing through air; the peculiar microrhythms of his syncopations seem to stem directly from the contours of his samples. “How could I call it my sound if I had not found it myself?” de Vargas asks, rhetorically, in a statement accompanying the record. For anyone depressed by the prospect of tomorrow’s streaming services filled with AI slop—or, indeed, by the frequency with which today’s electronic musicians default to generic sounds and tropes—Desde Los Oídos de un Sapo is a timely reminder that imagining a more dynamic musical future begins with learning to listen to the world around us.",0,"October 23, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lechuga-zafiro-desde-los-oidos-de-un-sapo/
Toro y Moi,Hole Erth,5.7,Electronic,"Chillwave may have come and gone, but its woozy footprints are everywhere: lofi hip-hop beats, Tame Impala’s continued dominance as a festival headliner, the endless barrage of shapeless AI synth tracks floating through Spotify like a garbage island in the Pacific. Disconnected from the actual talent of its OG practitioners, the scene that Chaz Bear (né Bundick) came up through as Toro y Moi has found real staying power in the current ecosystem of inoffensive, ambiguously jazz/funk/ambient sounds engineered for Maximum Vibe Wattage. Any indie act who’s stuck around as long as Toro y Moi must adapt, and in addition to dipping his toe into disco and indie rock and ambient, Bear has expanded to working with mainstream collaborators like Flume and Travis Scott. His new Toro y Moi project, Hole Erth, is a reference to the esoteric counterculture magazine Whole Earth Catalog, which Steve Jobs once referred to as a “paperback Google.” But while the hip-hop and pop-punk inspirations that Bear draws on for this album may have dominated the mid-2000s culture he came up in, they arrive on Hole Erth having already overstayed their welcome. Unlike his 2015 Samantha mixtape, where Bear experimented with R&B samples and features from Kool A.D. and Rome Fortune to arrive at a unique atmospheric sound, Hole Erth struggles to sound like anything but an imitation. It’s hard to fault Bear for trying out emo-rap when he’s been on the periphery of both since 24kGoldn was in kindergarten. But therein lies the problem: He’s now 37, sounding every bit his age as he adopts the cadence of music made almost exclusively by and for people younger than iTunes. It doesn’t help that many of his hip-hop nods resemble zeitgeist-y sounds from five years ago. “We back like bad teenagers,” Bear proclaims on “Walking in the Rain,” a would-be Astroworld leftover complete with hyperspace synths and Auto-Tuned interjections. “Off Road” sounds like a Roddy Ricch song about being stuck in traffic; the droning guitar and sludgy vocals on half the album are indebted to Lil Peep, minus the pathos and dread that made him compelling. Even when Bear brings on indie contemporary Ben Gibbard for “Hollywood,” he boxes the Death Cab for Cutie vocalist into a trap beat that combines with his airy tone like oil and water. The last time Bear positioned himself as a storyteller, on 2017’s Boo Boo, the results were ho-hum. As he tackles two notoriously lyric-heavy genres on Hole Erth, his weaknesses stick out more than ever. On stripper anthem “Babydaddy,” the best he can do is rhyme “UGA” with “MBA.” Elsewhere, he fills choruses with nice-sounding platitudes—“I was stone rolling, I was role playing, I was wind blowing”—that would be fine as window dressing, but come off as rambling when placed front-and-center in the mix. The two exceptions are “CD-R” and “Tuesday,” transmissions from Bear’s early days as an upstart musician with a refreshingly snotty attitude toward celebrity. “Blackberry days, I would talk to anyone,” he sings over a beat that sounds like it was extracted from a Y2K software package. It works a lot better than his extensive quoting of “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl” on “Heaven,” or the gratuitous Tom Petty reference propping up “Reseda.” When Bear stops trying to replicate the last vestiges of SoundCloud rap and merely takes a few cues from it, Hole Erth sounds more inspired. “Undercurrent,” a collaboration with Porches and Don Toliver, nails the unlikely partnership by crawling a new-wave guitar hook to a snail’s pace and having Toliver sing-rap over live drums. Out of all the guest stars here—including Kevin Abstract, Lev, DUCKWRTH, and Bear’s protégé Elijah Kessler—the one who shines brightest is Kenny Mason, who commands his verse on “Smoke” over moody piano and grunge-y acoustic guitar. With these songs, you can hear the love letter to aughts rap-rock that Bear aimed for, not a misguided attempt at catering to Fortnite players. Unfortunately, most of Hole Erth comes across like the latter. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Slum Village,F.U.N.,7.4,Rap,"From the jump, Slum Village have always been centered around three things: ill beats, boastful raps, and love songs more horny and cavalier than an army of porn bots. The tuneful intricacies of producer and founding member J Dilla’s music had such a gravitational pull at the Detroit group’s peak, they often overshadowed just how erotic the music could be. On Fan-Tas-Tic Vol. 1’s “The Look of Love, Pt. 1,” pattering drums and serene guitar strums cushion rappers and co-founders Baatin and T3’s thirst (“Your fragrance got me losing consciousness/Your stance got me unbuckling my fucking pants”). T3’s verse on the 2015 cut “Love Is” gets even more direct; it opens with a bluster about being inspired to write after getting some good head. Even after several lineup changes and the deaths of Dilla in 2006 and Baatin in 2009, the SV ethos never faltered. With T3 still at the helm, the group remains committed to the groove: They continue to be occasionally thoughtful, often rock-the-mic competitive, and always willing to bet on a piece of strange. F.U.N., SV’s tenth studio album and their first since 2015’s Yes!, stays true to that bold player spirit while still being something of a pivot for the group, now a duo made up of T3 and the rapper-producer Young RJ. It started out as a more “traditional” SV album with sample-based beats, but in a press release, RJ said the pair “felt like that was boring.” Instead, RJ—who has production credits on every song—leaned toward disco and funk, incorporating live instruments and presets to create a sound that pays tribute to their past, mixing the lush exuberance of the Gap Band with the dirty swing of Synth or Soul-era Black Milk. That sounds like a moonshot on paper, but SV keeps things as loose as they always have, while bringing new voices and ideas into the fold. The group transitioned from young bachelors on the prowl to frisky, sauced uncles in silk shirts and slides at the kickback some time ago, but F.U.N. slathers a funky coat of paint onto their aesthetic. Groove is an essential part of the SV sound, and while they’ve always been versatile with gritty and soulful music, F.U.N. pops with a colorful energy that didn’t exist even back in their scrappier days. “All Live” gives their patented club-hopping a new context, with vibrant horns and luscious bass and synths flashing like tri-color flood lights. T3 and RJ are energetic, even peppy, as they drop references to Mase and Rubi Rose over the satin production. “All Live Pt. 2.” brings in harder drums and piano stabs for longtime collaborator Phat Kat to warn rappers that he’ll abort them like Roe v. Wade. This two-song suite, like the rest of the album, reframes the spit-kicking and dirty-macking sides of SV without making them look like bland revivalists or clueless trend chasers. Not much has changed lyrically, but the fullness of RJ’s beats reanimates the group here. There’s an even mix of homages to disco and funk and the vintage head knockers they made their name on, but it’s so well-curated that it can be easy not to notice. Take the way that “To the Disco” and “Request,” both featuring contributions from British band Abstract Orchestra, flow directly into each other without harshing the transition into the jittery, Karriem Riggins-assisted “Yeah Yeah.” Or consider how the title track and “Keep Dreaming” maintain an early 2000s boom-bap aura without devolving into boring retreads. They’ve found a slightly different lane, and they seem grateful to be cruising in it. Part of that newfound zeal also stems from the album’s features, which venture outside of their usual suspects in ways we haven’t seen since 2004’s Detroit Deli (A Taste of Detroit). Some of the guest features make sense on first glance, like Bruiser Brigade member Fat Ray barreling through “Keep Dreaming,” or genre-hopping rap emissaries like Eric Roberson (“Factor”) and Robert Glasper (“Since 92”). But many of the album’s best moments are blindsiding. Chicago rapper Brittney Carter sets the tone for the whole LP on “Welcome,” arriving with the kind of fiery verse that only comes from being summoned by industry veterans. Sango brings his breezy sensibilities to Phat Kat’s spirited verse on “All Live Pt. 2,” while Larry June offers his chill, Bay Area elegance to the dancefloor chic of “Just Like You.” SV have done their homework, recruiting the right voices to freshen up the vibes; even a so-so verse from puppy-dog rap star Cordae on “So Superb” doesn’t drag things down. It’s been almost a decade since the last proper Slum Village album, so the fact that F.U.N. works as well as it does is a relief. Seasoned MCs take time off and often come back bitter and/or rusty, especially in rap. But while F.U.N. isn’t a genre-rocking comeback effort in the vein of A Tribe Called Quest’s We got it from Here…Thank You 4 Your service or Little Brother’s May the Lord Watch, it’s still fun to see everyone’s favorite Detroit players find their place in the present moment. Lascivious lovers like Brent Faiyaz and Cash Cobain have the hot hand in the streets and on the charts, so it’s only right that the OGs step back in the ring to remind everyone how it’s done.",0,"May 6, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/slum-village-fun/
This Is Lorelei,"Box for Buddy, Box for Star",7.8,Rock,"To behold Stonehenge is to bear witness to the human capacity for ingenuity. For songwriter Nate Amos, who records as This Is Lorelei, an encounter with the megalithic structure was life-changing: It convinced him to stop smoking weed. The prospect of giving up a habit he’d indulged nearly every day for 15 years was daunting, but Amos decided to channel his subsequent restless energy into songwriting. Maybe it was the lack of weed; maybe Amos was building off the recent success of his various other projects; maybe those Neolithic rocks transmitted something magic to him—regardless, the resulting album, Box for Buddy, Box for Star, is a keenly crafted and wonderfully adventurous set of songs, both earnest and appealingly funny. Amos had his Stonehenge revelation while on tour with Water From Your Eyes, with whom he makes razor-sharp art-pop; he’s also one-half of the whimsical duo My Idea with Palberta’s Lily Konisberg. But Amos has been releasing solo music as This Is Lorelei for years, treating the alias as a catchall for experiments and unfiltered songwriting, and uploading to Bandcamp dozens of releases dating back a decade. In that way, he shares something of a musical kinship with Alex G, another prolific songwriter who got his start releasing batches of bedroom recordings on Bandcamp, and who—like Amos—combines a love for noise with Americana-ish songwriting. (As for Amos’ literal musical kinship: his father is a veteran bluegrass musician whose influence can be heard in the album’s moments of wistful twang.) Box for Buddy, Box for Star represents the first time Amos set out to write a proper This Is Lorelei album. Focusing on classic, sturdy songcraft, Amos played, sang, or sampled everything on the record himself, and his appetite is vast; there’s singer-songwriter fare, Auto-Tuned pop, sampled strings, a meditative piano interlude. Whereas Amos’ ear for detail turns Water From Your Eyes’ songs into chunks of delightful chaos, here his flourishes are more approachable, if no less deft: the big classic-rock chords that cut in after the first verse of “A Song That Sings About You,” the twinkly keys on “My Boy Limbo,” the dreamy vocal melody of “Two Legs.” His plaintive lyrics about romance and heartache have a surprisingly straightforward emotional quality. “Love, if you said you needed two legs/I’d give you mine,” he promises on “Two Legs”; on “A Song That Sings About You,” he mourns, “All these cities look the same without you.” But even in their most sincere moments, his songs are still the identifiable work of a goofball. “Dancing in the Club” features a reference to Steely Dan’s “Babylon Sisters” and a guitar riff that channels “What’s My Age Again.” (Amos claims Blink-182 “saved” him and taught him to value songs that are “fast, catchy and simple.”) The album’s opening moments sound like a curtain rising over a honky-tonk, a steel-guitar-and-strummed-chords soundtrack to a moving duet between two parting lovers—except that’s Amos singing both parts, and it’s actually a song about a cowboy who gets abducted by an angel. Amos has called Box for Buddy, Box for Star a “delayed recovery album”—by the time he stopped smoking weed, he had already gone through the challenges of quitting alcohol and amphetamines, and was in a tough period of self-reflection about what would come next. Many of these songs confront those difficulties head-on: “When you left me to drink/I thought I’d die in my sleep,” he sings on “Where’s Your Love Now”; “But I’m healthier now/And I’m happier now.” The propulsive and compulsively listenable “I’m All Fucked Up” wobbles through scenes with the non-linearity of dream logic—getting high and passing out, having a nosebleed in Spain and finding God—but when you realize Amos wrote it as a loving admonishment of his younger self, it recasts each repetition of “You little sick thing/You had your fun” as the kind of scolding you only earn once you’ve made it to the other side. As an experiment in sincerity, the album works precisely because it knows how to see things from these dual perspectives—because it laces candor with irony, because its pop songcraft can’t help incorporating off-kilter impulses. Even amid our most self-destructive habits, it’s an optimistic act to believe we can change. For all the record’s humor, curveballs, and cowboy abductions, its perspective is genuinely one of hope: “I don’t mind the present and I like the past,” Amos muses on “Perfect Hand.” “I think that the future’s worth it.” All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Been Stellar,"Scream From New York, NY",7.2,Rock,"Somewhere between the release of Meet Me in the Bathroom (the book) and Meet Me in the Bathroom (the documentary), New York’s early-aughts rock revival entered the realm of classic rock. The Strokes are fêted with vinyl box sets and a decades-too-late Grammy. Interpol are touring behind the 20th anniversary of Antics. LCD Soundsystem are in their residency era, like an Eagles alternative for people who tried Four Loko twice. And perennial underdogs the Walkmen have shape-shifted into reunion darlings. It’s all romance and mythology now. Those bands’ classic albums are as old now as Fear of Music and Parallel Lines were in 2001. Now the city’s been reborn after another world-shifting tragedy, but—amid exorbitant rents and the displacement of the creative underclass—it’s hard to imagine a new crop of bands reinvigorating the rock scene. Enter Been Stellar, an NYU-formed quintet who’ve become a ubiquitous and ambitious presence in the downtown music scene. “All of those bands—the Strokes, the Walkmen, Interpol—were a galvanizing thing for us,” guitarist Skyler Knapp recently told an interviewer. Been Stellar’s career has accelerated with similar speed. Before releasing an album, they toured with the 1975 and opened for Interpol. When I saw the group at Mercury Lounge last year, they played with a bombast and gusto that signaled they were destined for bigger venues. They may wince at being added to playlists with names like “Meet Me in the Bathroom Take 2” and grumble about Strokes comparisons, but can you blame depressed millennials for wanting to believe in the myth of rock renewal? Been Stellar may be victims of projection, but rarely has a young, hungry New York band made being a young, hungry New York band so central to their identity. On an early cut called “Manhattan Youth,” they pondered the NYC childhoods these transplants never had. Now they take inspiration from the wordless screams and chaotic sounds that define daily life in New York and title their debut album Scream From New York, NY. In the urgent, combustible opener, “Start Again,” singer Sam Slocum wanders First Avenue, trading words with a well-dressed alcoholic, before yowling a climactic refrain of “New York wasted/Start again, start again!” It’s a thrilling statement of intent. The band’s strongest songs are often rooted in the city’s peculiar landmarks. Across its formidable six minutes, “I Have the Answer” marshals waves of shoegaze sludge as Slocum describes an epiphany at the American Museum of Natural History’s whale exhibit. (Noah Baumbach, eat your heart out.) The rousing title track summons an image of the East Village’s Middle Church burning in a 2020 fire as Slocum transforms a hokey Reagan slogan (“Morning in America”) into a refrain laced with noise and dread. Funny thing is, Been Stellar don’t sound too much like the Strokes. Slocum’s throaty growl sounds a bit like Julian Casablancas, but he also sounds like a young Johnny Rzeznik or Joseph D’Agostino. He sings with earnest emotion, not disaffected cool, and injects each chorus with breathless urgency, even when it’s hard to tell what he’s so worked up about (“Passing Judgment”). After the roiling punk of the opening numbers the album’s tempos slow, and brooding standouts like “Pumpkin” and “Takedown” recall the grandiose angst and soaring melodicism of the mid-’90s UK wave—early Verve, Bends-era Radiohead. If Been Stellar seem like a nostalgia magnet, they can’t help but summon top-shelf influences. Across these 10 tracks, Been Stellar make a claim as one of New York’s most promising bands, but they don’t always land on a clear identity of their own. “Can’t Look Away” summons the grit and swagger of their heaviest tunes, but much of the record’s latter half blends together in an indistinct mid-tempo haze. They lack the spiky eccentricity or creativity of rising NYC peers like Godcaster or Water From Your Eyes, and some of their songs (“Sweet,” “All in One”) carry a vague, imitative quality. No matter what, there’s an earnestness that belies the jokey, tossed-off band name. Still, Scream From New York, NY harnesses the group’s keening intensity and taps into a vivid sense of place. They’re not the first songwriters to draw inspiration from the chaotic thrum of New York City, but they bring this literary tradition into a troubled new era. On the title track, Slocum sketches a compelling snapshot of a city coming unglued. That the song’s grim imagery—black smoke, people coughing through masks—evokes several very different real-life events only underlines how many crises of apocalyptic proportions New York has endured this century. To live here is to watch the city swing between collapse and rebirth and back again. Been Stellar may not usher in a full-scale rock revival, but at least they’re making the bad times sound good.",0,"June 25, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/been-stellar-scream-from-new-york-ny/
Jessica Pratt,Here in the Pitch,8.8,Folk/Country,"There is already so much to admire about Jessica Pratt the folk artist: her elliptical lyrics, her nylon-string guitar and voice to match. But the label of folk singer-songwriter doesn’t quite capture the real essence of the Jessica Pratt song. It is difficult to describe, like a dream that doesn’t go anywhere but still feels like you should talk about it in therapy. In the bottom right-hand corner of the lyric sheet that accompanies the physical release of her fourth album, Here in the Pitch, Pratt includes a quote from Leonard Cohen, pulled from a 1975 Crawdaddy interview about the genesis of songwriting and trusting your own process: “The fact is that you feel like singing, and this is the song that you know.” The great joy of Here in the Pitch is getting familiar with this mysterious song that Pratt knows so well. There are nine of them here that amount to less than half an hour of music—notable not only in an era of gluttonous releases but also because it’s the same track count and runtime as her last record, Quiet Signs, which she put out five years ago. Now, for the first time on her albums, there’s some light drumming and synth playing, a few basslines and distant bongos. Yet none of this makes the music sound bigger. It’s as if we’re zooming out while dollying in, a hypnotic shift in perspective that makes the music sound more intimate in a larger space. It is a prime example of hypnagogic folk that quietly explores the simultaneity of time in all its misery, wonder, and promise. Which is to say, it also has a lot of reverb. What did she use as a reverb chamber, an Olympic natatorium? No, but as on Quiet Signs, Pratt continues to put the studio to work for her the way famed pop innovators like Brian Wilson or Phil Spector did by letting her voice sound like it could fill a cathedral in these tiny little songs. If her first couple of homespun records were her Pink Moon, this one has more the feel of Bryter Later, the warm sound of psych-folk melancholy sparsely appointed and loosely fleshed out. Sprinkle in the Brazilian rhythms of ’70s MPB albums and the pinpoint vocal precision of someone like Judee Sill or even a jazz singer like Anita O’Day, and you’re starting to map the old soul and hazy recombinant soundworld of Here in the Pitch. Something in its chemistry will turn any speaker into a vent that leaks the album into the room until it is invisible and all-consuming. To understand this mysterious Pratt song, one must submit to its dream logic. She’s one of the few songwriters who, I think, favors the verse over the chorus. There’s no release of tension or fulfillment of a promise when she arrives at something resembling a chorus. Instead, her choruses gently turn you around and lead you back to the verse, where Pratt’s vocal melodies gambol and cartwheel around the space. The timbre of her voice resembles a breathy saxophone, like a cool Paul Desmond bossa nova tune. It is reedy and precise, languid and surprisingly technical. No one could just sing the melody on the verse of “Get Your Head Out,” right? You can hear just how considered every note is, each sung with her own unique interpretation of American vowels. One of my favorite moments in Pratt’s catalog is on the song “Jacquelyn in the Background,” from 2015’s On Your Own Love Again, where it sounds like she’s impossibly detuning her guitar as she’s playing it. This melting sound was an unsettling moment of trickery for an artist whose elemental rawness was part and parcel of her draw. There’s a more subtle use of post-production effects on the dizzyingly obtuse highlight “Empires Never Know,” a rare piano-led song that features some backmasking effect on the vocals. You only hear it for a few seconds, but it’s crucial. Like Cindy Lee’s recent hypnagogic Motown pop record, Diamond Jubilee, the way Here in the Pitch uses the studio to bend and abstract the instruments makes it sound more like a transmission than a recording. These albums feel beamed in from far away, or long ago, so that this imagined distance the music travels makes each song feel much larger and more important than if it were produced like a Tiny Desk concert. “Empires Never Know” also becomes the closest thing to a title track when Pratt sings, “I never was what they called me in the dark”—if you take the “pitch” in the title to mean darkness and not black tar. The syntax of that line is typical of the Pratt song. She uses odd tenses and conditional grammar to comment on the past or presage the future. These lines emerge as riddles and half-thoughts: “I used to want for what your desolation hadn’t come by” or “I soon should know what remains” or “It’s only lasted for awhile.” Pratt’s narrator is constantly inquiring about emotional states, searching high and low for the right phrase to evoke a feeling that’s difficult to name. This temporal displacement and imagistic writing make Here in the Pitch feel vaporous at first, but it soon becomes its own transfixing language, a magnet that makes your internal compass go haywire. “And wouldn’t you say the past’s no longer quite as near as you’d like?” Take a minute with that one, from the final, warmest, most hopeful track, “The Last Year.” You’re witnessing music’s greatest horologist create another ornate clock to hang on the wall. Time is her muse, after all, this invisible force that binds the whole of the world to the same path. Her four albums comprise a body of work that is a metaphysical exploration of time and what you can find in its pockets. Her song considers how strange it is to conceive a distance between two moments, and likewise, how beautiful it is to consider the distance between two people. This is the Jessica Pratt song, and Here in the Pitch hones it to its finest point. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Adeline Hotel,Whodunnit,7.3,Folk/Country,"How should heartbreak sound? Writing about budding love or desire can be simple, aided by universal clichés, an ecstatic rush of endorphins and, hopefully, a really sexy bassline. But the breakup album is a thornier task—and not only for the risk of fallout from publicly revealing the underbelly of a private relationship. If each unhappy family is, as Anna Karenina tells us, unlike in its own way, it follows that each fractured partnership breaks differently, rarely straight down the middle between amicable and acrimonious. Whodunnit, the new record from Brooklyn musician Dan Knishkowy, who records as Adeline Hotel, is ostensibly an album about divorce. But unlike the fiery resentment that powered Rumours or the shame and self-hatred of Tunnel of Love, Knishkowy takes a whimsical and meditative approach to the subject, swapping salacious details for microscopic allegories. Backed by fingerpicked guitar, piano, and the occasional upright bass, he makes the end of a marriage sound unexpectedly healing. There isn’t a smoking gun in the lyrics of Whodunnit. In its place, there’s poetic ennui with a hint of self-destruction. On the title track, he can’t stop “daydreaming about the thunder,” stuck in a negative feedback loop like a “wheel inside a wheel inside a cog.” He admits to small failures—he’s “sober, kind of,” letting bills pile up on “Preying On.” He often writes like your folksy grandfather—“Another bite, I might explode!” he exclaims on “Grief.” The one profanity he utters, on “Isn’t That Enough?,” sounds like a small explosion, a brief loss of composure. But mostly, the album deals with the heavy sense of impending doom at the end of a relationship, manifested by an ominous storm that keeps rearing its head (first on the title track, then on “Egg on My Face”), and the temptation of independence, imagined as a juicy peach on “How Did I Get So Lucky?” and “Joy.” Recurring motifs across multiple songs lend a patchwork quality to the record, piecing together a larger narrative that only comes into view when taken as a whole. For an album about such a deep kind of loss, it’s perhaps the most unburdened Adeline Hotel has ever sounded. Where previous albums might lean into a flurry of fingerpicked guitar in a moment of silence, here the instrumentation often retreats to let Knishkowy’s voice, which hasn’t been featured on an Adeline Hotel record in nearly three years, take focus. The shakiness of prior records is largely gone—instead, Knishkowy sounds in command of his rasp and his range, his vocals landing somewhere between the earnestness of Room for Squares-era John Mayer and the sheepish profundity of Jason Molina. Compared to previous albums featuring Knishkowy’s singing, like 2021’s The Cherries Are Speaking, the arrangements here serve to highlight his voice and his lyrics, rather than obscure them. Upright bass from Carmen Quill announces Knishkowy’s arrival on “Isn’t That Enough,” low notes plucked out each time he starts another couplet. Piano echoes behind his verses on “I Will Let Your Flowers Grow,” as if a stand-in while he searches for the right words, retreating when his vocals finally return, backed by a chorus of additional voices. It’s the most Adeline Hotel has sounded like a straight-ahead rock band, rather than one man’s fingerpicked fever dream. Swaddled in una corda and piano from Office Culture’s Winston Cook-Wilson on “Possible Lives,” he pushes his voice into a hesitant upper range, finding a mix of trepidation and triumph once he reaches its highest note, an audible manifestation of the internal turmoil of the topic at hand. Despite its title, Whodunnit never seeks to point fingers or assign blame, either to Knishkowy or the unnamed other party hinted at in his lyrics. It’s an album about the in-between feelings at the end of a long romance, written in the middle of its undoing rather than with the comfort and assurance of distance. Though he addresses his emotions directly on songs like “Grief” and “Joy,” they’re often best described in the silhouette of metaphor. Looking down at his hands on “Isn’t That Enough,” he wonders if they’re specked with “The dirt of love/Or rust that builds inside the mines of ordinary friendship.” It’s a striking representation of how similar love and familiarity can appear, the way commitment, over time, can start to justify its own continuation. On Whodunnit, Knishkowy breaks from the cycle of a failed marriage little by little, finding freedom by breathing space into its dark crevices.",0,"October 2, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/adeline-hotel-whodunnit/
Raz Fresco,The Eternal Now,7.1,Rap,"The thing about road trips is that I remember a lot more about the aux cord arguments and hot take debates along the way than I do snapping photos of the Grand Canyon. Admittedly, my biggest flaw as a rap fan is not taking that lesson to heart: I’m so caught up in what’s next that I forget that getting there is the best part. One rapper I wish I’d paid closer attention to is Raz Fresco, who got his start as a Brampton teenager in the early 2010s with a laid-back swag that resembled Wiz Khalifa if he were in the A$AP Mob. Eventually, he fell into the orbit of Atlanta’s DJ Holiday, and then Philly’s Don Cannon, releasing a string of solid, versatile mixtapes full of streetwise smoker’s anthems. Somewhere in the middle of the decade, Raz Fresco fell off my radar. In that time he got deeper into his studies of the Five-Percent Nation, went to jail, had a near-death experience, and kept tinkering with his music. I wasn’t drawn back in until the pandemic, in the midst of his mixtape series Magneto Was Right, titled after an X-Men comic book fan theory that holds that the antihero Magneto’s idea for a violent revolution to free the mutants was more rational than Professor X’s philosophy of peace. In a little more than a year, Raz Fresco put out nine of these tapes, finding a real groove in the process. It wasn’t radically different from the music he’d released as a teenager, but it was headier and loaded with the life experience to go with beats that brought to mind late-’90s Queens. (I’d now place his music somewhere between the hard-nosed nostalgia of Griselda and the new age flyness of Mutant Academy.) He’s been prolific ever since, leading up to The Eternal Now, a satisfying joint project with reliable production OG DJ Muggs. Over 15 slow-mo tracks, Raz Fresco uses his buttery flow to weave together hard-earned life lessons, five-percenter lingo, comic book references, and a sense of disillusionment with the commercialization of hip-hop. On “Smoke & Mirrors,” backdropped by Muggs at his dreamiest, Raz name-drops the creator of Spawn, calls someone a “pussy” and “a slave to the charts,” and reflects on his artistic morals: “You can’t get your soul back or reverse the hour hand/This is how it lasts.” Less thoughtful writing sometimes undercuts his message, veering into cliché with the repetition of “Who own the dollar own the country” on “Bloody Money” or repeating tired hip-hop talking points on “Fake Beef”: “Used to paint the walls, now it’s they fingernails.” Save those out-of-touch gripes for the old heads with a YouTube channel. But I enjoy the way Raz’s raps sometimes feel like a period piece: If it weren’t for a couple of technological and pop culture references here and there, you would think he was living in 1995, not born in 1995. In an era when so many rappers under 30 sound like they all grew up on the same movies and television, he’s going on about Carl Sagan and Rocky IV, which isn’t digging that deep, but hey, at least it’s one less rapper talking about Paid in Full and Steph Curry. There’s a lot of twisty wordplay even if he never blows me away; his skill as a rapper is that he’s really easy to listen to no matter how ruminative he gets. On the horn-blaring “World Peace,” he threads together social critiques (political corruption, neighborhood violence) in a verbose way, but his flow is so smooth that you wouldn’t mind throwing on the track during a candlelight dinner. As far as DJ Muggs’ beatmaking renaissance goes, nothing here will end up in his highlight reel. The last time a Muggs beat really caught me off guard was when he channeled Coke Wave on Jay Worthy’s “In New York.” His work on this album is by the books. No shame in that, because even basic Muggs is pretty sweet. The grimier, blunt-force instrumentals like “Blow the Spot Up” or “Fifty Bop” are on the duller side, while the standouts are so jazzy and breezy that they could soundtrack Gene Hackman cruising around New York in The French Connection (check out “Spooky”). But at this point, a joint project with Muggs is a right of passage: a victory lap for those who, like Raz Fresco, have survived the grind of the underground rap circuit and arrived at some sort of destination.",0,"August 1, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/raz-fresco-dj-muggs-the-eternal-now/
Mas Aya,Coming and Going,7.7,Electronic,"A simple tenet guides Brandon Miguel Valdivia’s music as Mas Aya: “The more personal you can make music, the more interesting it is.” He does just that on his fifth album, Coming and Going. On “Be,” the Nicaraguan Canadian percussionist and producer passes the mic to his young daughter, Martina, and Valdivia’s partner and co-parent, Lido Pimienta, appears throughout the album—as she did on 2021’s Máscaras—softening Mas Aya’s twitchy, organically textured beatscapes to the point that they feel like the fruit of a family jam session.Spending an afternoon with Valdivia and Pimienta sounds like it must be enchanting, considering the duo’s vast range of experiences, credits, and collaborations—from remixing Run the Jewels to starring on a children’s television show with Beverly Glenn-Copeland. Keeping busy throughout pandemic purgatory, Valdivia and Pimienta not only became parents, but moved from cosmopolitan Toronto to the comparatively suburban London, Ontario. Coming and Going was initially composed around field recordings that Valdivia collected at his parents’ house, drawing upon Buddhist spiritual practices to create a sense of tranquility within the frantic beats, like Arthur Russell after listening to Traxman. Coming and Going boasts a patient, panoramic sound that embraces a lifetime of disparate cultures, communities, and influences. Valdivia welcomes house music’s pulse under spiritual jazz’s sprawling tent; the album gathers together a village of guest players, such as Afro-Cuban percussionist Reimundo Sosa, trumpeter Nicole Rampersaud, and Josh Cole on bowed bass. “Dora” and “Windless, Waveless,” the album’s bouncy opening songs, flash back to folktronica-era Four Tet and Caribou. “Ocarina” is anything but a reference to The Legend of Zelda, wrapping Rob Clutton’s luminous electric bass in rustling percussion and Rampersaud’s bright streaks of horn. Pumping pianos reminiscent of Mas Aya’s labelmate Scott Hardware echo throughout “What Shattering!” and the astonishing “No Trace,” an oasis of jazzy ambient bliss with vocals from fellow Toronto musician Isla Craig. By the time he reaches closer “Abre Camino,” Valdivia has stretched all the way out, filling nearly seven minutes with shimmering synths, wooden flutes, and rhythms piled upon rhythms. Miraculously, these kinds of densely crisscrossed threads soothe instead of stress, drifting deeper into the ambient dimensions of Mas Aya’s music. On Máscaras, his music’s spiritual dimension masked political subtexts that were revealed in samples of street protests and revolutionary poets. This time, the personal is political. Alongside the warmly tactile sounds of the album’s innumerable interwoven instruments, the loving presence of the two primary people in Valdivia’s life, and an even larger chosen family of close collaborators, creates a human connection so strong you can feel it. One way of pushing back against injustice, he suggests, is simply existing in the here and now with your loved ones—an action so potent it needs no words to resonate.

Megan Thee Stallion,MEGAN,6.6,Rap,"It is hard to overstate Megan Thee Stallion’s success: She is not just a rap star, but the kind of supercharged celebrity who appears in commercials and movies and hobnobs with pop stars, all while serving as the new flagbearer of Houston rap heritage. On MEGAN, her newest album, you can feel the pressure on her to keep all those plates spinning—to maintain momentum, to not fuck it up. After Tina Snow, the 2018 EP that cemented Megan as a rapper who’s as raunchy, funny, and charismatic as anyone, all of her full-length projects have, to varying degrees, felt like exercises in becoming everything to everyone. But it’s never been as distracting as it is on MEGAN, an uneven album so preoccupied with giving every single type of fan exactly what they want that it might as well be crowdsourced. Do you share Megan’s infatuation with anime? Then you will get a thrill out of “Otaku Hot Girl,” which samples a song from Jujutsu Kaisen and features an intro from one of the show’s voice actors. Bankroll Got It’s drum-heavy flip of the soundtrack is uninteresting—though it’s not like he’s working with an anime renowned for its music—and the character references are earnest but unbearably corny. The better song that leans into her fondness for Japanese culture is the multilingual “Mamushi,” which pulls off the theme without flattening her personality. Maybe instead you need new Megan to play at your Pilates class: She’s got you with the feel-good “Worthy,” a Lizzo-coded pop song. Those muscles are put to more effective use on “Spin,” where the silky Victoria Monét hook complements aggressively flirty Megan verses. The fluffy finger-snap beat sounds like it could have been on Love/Hate. (Come to think of it, Megan would have ripped “Shawty Is Da Shit.”) Then there are the songs for those deeply invested in Megan’s beefs and squabbles. I can picture fans gathering in group chats, dissecting subliminals and clues like they’re in an Agatha Christie book club. After the last three months, I’m all feuded out, so I’m less interested in that game. Still, she lands a few good jokes on “Hiss,” where she calls out the misogynistic dudes in rap who can’t keep her name out of their mouths. (Drake has had a one-sided vendetta toward her for a while now; Megan hits back with some BBL Drizzy theories of her own.) “Rattle,” which has a fast, groovy beat that melodic South Florida rappers would eat up, leaves a sting. “’Cause the niggas don’t beef with the niggas/They scared of each other, but beat on the women,” she attacks; she could be talking about a dozen different rappers, which makes the song feel like a sharp indictment of hip-hop culture in general. As critical as that line is, she still has fun chanting, “Ain’t got no tea on me, this ho’ think she TMZ” while hitting a Harley Quinn cackle in the background. Megan doesn’t fool around like that enough. Even tracks made to light up the club feel as if they’re satisfying expectations. On the would-be party anthem “Where Them Girls At,” Megan reworks the nostalgic Facebook-era twerk sound of Kansas City’s Kstylis. She doesn’t add anything new to his style; I can only imagine how TisaKorean, a Houston native who is always having a good-ass time tinkering with the past, would have sauced it up. Megan loosens up alongside Glorilla on “Accent,” capturing the tipsy bounce she’s always had in freestyles and features, like Latto’s “Sunday Service” remix. When she’s in that mode, she’s incredibly funny. “That ain’t my bae, he really more like my bidet,” she raps on “B.A.S.,” a Teena Marie-sampling club drill experiment that works because she’s all in. She’s even got a whole song (“Down Stairs DJ”) about masturbating before she falls asleep—not unexpected from Megan, but silly in a way her best music can be, going back to “Big Ole Freak.” For all my reservations about MEGAN, I do understand the pressures, especially in rap, where hitmaking women have historically been discarded quickly. Foxy Brown got caught in label purgatory after 2001’s Broken Silence wasn’t as huge as Def Jam hoped; Trina had dirt thrown on her name when she did her own thing away from Trick Daddy. The stories are endless. The fears are real. If Lil Baby drops an album that makes zero cultural impact, he can go back to the drawing board. If Megan does? Who knows. She’s not trying to find out. This reality isn’t just depressing on a systemic level, but also because of the effect it has on an artist like Megan Thee Stallion. Even for one of the most celebrated Texas rappers of her generation, nurturing a fanbase takes priority over the music because it feels like a matter of time until the hip-hop industry finds an excuse to turn its back.

Jelly Roll,Beautifully Broken,6.4,Folk/Country,"In his 1999 autobiography My House of Memories, Merle Haggard marveled at his stardom, knowing it’d be a pipe dream by the standards of the day. “Can you imagine what would happen today if I were 24, just out of prison, and trying to get a record deal in Nashville?” wondered the working man’s poet, who spent much of his youth incarcerated before becoming one of country music’s most beloved voices. “Today’s sanitized country music is produced by a bunch of artists who sound like each other. No label would take a chance on my sound, especially with my background, if I were trying to start over.” Twenty-five years later, Jelly Roll’s success suggests that the industry would sooner gamble on the background than the sound. The Nashville native spent his 15th, 16th, and 17th birthdays in juvenile detention and, like Haggard, got his GED in jail. Back then, he was a charismatic freestyler inspired by Three 6 Mafia and 8ball & MJG, but over time, his writing drifted from boilerplate trap music toward intense Southern rock songs about sin and salvation. The rapper’s reinvention as a country balladeer has coincided with his rise as one of the 2020s’ biggest breakout stars, particularly since the release of last year’s Whitsitt Chapel—his ninth studio album, but the first one billed explicitly as country. “There is something poetic about a 39-year-old man winning New Artist of the Year,” he said in his acceptance speech at last year’s CMA Awards, his voice trembling with fire and brimstone. “I don’t know where you’re at in your life or what you’re going through, but I want to tell you to keep going, baby. I want to tell you success is on the other side of it. I want to tell you it’s gonna be okay.” In Jelly Roll’s music, a few things are understood: that heaven and hell are places on earth; that within each human being is the capacity for evil; and that while no man is beyond redemption, it’s also a slippery slope. His biggest hits (“Son of a Sinner,” “Need a Favor”) counter the popular notion that we are infinitely perfectible, that all that stands between us and felicity is therapy and self-care; certain scars, these songs suggest, were never meant to heal. There’s no doubt Jelly is currently at the peak of his career, but the 22 tracks of his 10th album, Beautifully Broken, give little indication that life is good at all, love of his family aside. What kind of asshole would he be to suddenly start flexing for his mostly working-class fanbase, for whom he is not just a hero but an ambassador? Instead, he begins Beautifully Broken at rock bottom—sweating in a church basement with his hands shaking, wishing he was anywhere else. “I haven’t touched a drop in seven hours, three minutes/Hardly sobered up, already want to quit quitting,” he sings on “Winning Streak,” ashamed to admit his failings to a room of strangers until he meets a man 20 years clean. It’s poignant songwriting, despite a few clichés. Then the chorus hits—a stomp-clap/gospel moment that spells “triumph over adversity” in flashing neon lights. Same deal with “Heart of Stone,” a desperate singalong (“Dear Lord, can you help me? I’ve fallen out of grace/I’m crawling back to heaven from this hell on earth I’ve made”) jacked up with the full Imagine Dragons treatment. There’s no shortage of big build-ups and “whoa-oh-ay-ohh”s, and though Jelly once declared his sound “somewhere between Hank, Three 6, and Kid Rock,” here it’s closer to the intersection of Twenty One Pilots and Gnarls Barkley. It’s been said that the experience of a Jelly Roll concert is something like an evangelical revival, but his frequent invocation of heaven, hell, and fallen angels isn’t out of place in mainstream rap and R&B, where haunted young bluesmen have been warbling about their demons to a degree of commercial success that is almost alarming. Themes of trauma and addiction saturate the charts, as pain rap’s luminaries release essentially the same record over and over again. Surely somebody somewhere—maybe millions of somebodies—needs to hear Jelly Roll singing, “I’m not okay, but it’s all gonna be alright” over pedal steel and fiddle on lead single “I Am Not Okay,” which soundtracked the In Memoriam segment of this year’s Emmy Awards. Still, a monstrous question lingers: Is it too much to ask that the music meant to salve America’s broken heart also be good? But then there’s “Hear Me Out,” which opens with a missed call from a friend. The guy’s been in and out of rehab, and Jelly hasn’t seen him much since his mother passed. It’s late, but Jelly calls back anyway. “Hear me out,” the friend pleads. “Tell me how I always feel like something’s missing/I’d make a sound, but what’s the point if no one’s listening?” Herein lies the crux of Jelly Roll’s creative mission: to give a voice, a soundtrack, and some cachet to Americans as often disregarded by our cultural institutions as by our governing bodies. His efforts extend well past the realm of music: In January, he sat before a Senate committee to testify for sanctions to stop the fentanyl supply chain. “I understand the paradox of my history as a drug dealer,” he said. “But I think that’s what makes me perfect to talk about this. I was a part of the problem. I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.” There is nuance in this speech, straightforward as it may be, that Beautifully Broken begs for more of. (It’s there in “My Cross,” an ode to his daughter: “Your blood is my blood, and poison runs deep/Knowing you’re mine scares the hell out of me.”) Clearly Jelly Roll has stories, the kind whose minor details make for timeless country classics like Haggard’s “If We Make It Through December,” where a laid-off factory worker builds a castle in the sky, or Kris Kristofferson’s “The Pilgrim, Chapter 33,” whose complicated poet can’t get out of his own way. As for now, he has the voice, the pathos, and the charisma required of an American folk hero. Now all he needs are the songs.

Anna Butterss,Mighty Vertebrate,7.3,Jazz,"Anna Butterss is caught between two worlds—or three, or four. The dream of a life in jazz lured them from Australia to the U.S., but they soon became one of the most in-demand bassists in a raft of other genres, working with indie darlings Andrew Bird and Jenny Lewis, stalwart singer-songwriters Jason Isbell and Aimee Mann, and rock star Phoebe Bridgers. (A touring gig with the latter earned them a spot on Bridgers’ acclaimed Punisher and Boygenius’ Grammy-winning The Record.) But even as their profile rises elsewhere, Butterss has stayed adamantly rooted in Los Angeles’ jazz community. Moonlighting on cramped stages and in small back rooms, they’ve helped to foment a small-scale revolution documented on albums like Jeff Parker’s modern classic Mondays at the Enfield Tennis Academy and SML’s Small Medium Large. On top of all this, Butterss now has to look after a solo career. Butterss’ first solo album, 2022’s Activities, was a product of circumstance made after Colorfield Records’ Pete Min invited them to experiment with a range of instruments—most of which were not bass—during one feverish day in the studio. For Mighty Vertebrate, they’ve taken the opposite approach by carefully composing every part before recording note one. This was a new process for Butterss, but they found familiarity in friendly faces: saxophonist Josh Johnson and guitarist Gregory Uhlmann are bandmates in SML, while drummer and producer Ben Lumsdaine has been a collaborator since they were both teenagers. “They’re going to understand what this is supposed to feel like,” reasoned Butterss. “We’re not going to have to talk about it much.” Indeed, years of improvising together meant that the band knew exactly what Butterss expected—not traditional jazz, but a jazz-inflected melange of styles, from lo-fi hip-hop to slow-burn post-rock. Butterss set themself a discrete objective for each track, crafting a homemade version of Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies. One such task was to “make a song that uses groups of three-bar phrasing,” resulting in album opener “Bishop.” The track runs on an undeniable low-end groove rounded out with pearlescent guitar and new-age synths until the bottom, quite literally, drops out. A seaside field recording makes for a serene bridge; then the band jumps in again on a dime, immediately locking in with redoubled energy. Butterss’ group exhibits the same breathtaking exactitude across the record, adapting itself to each genre like a full cast of method actors. To finish another goal (“sample something and make it into a song”) Butterss grabbed dialogue from the Mexican dramedy La Casa de Las Flores: “La homosexualidad no es una enfermedad. La homofobia, sí… Desafortunadamente para ustedes la estupidez no tiene cura.” (“Homosexuality is not an illness, but homophobia is… Unfortunately for you, stupidity has no cure.”) The dark, driving “Breadrich” grows out of this impassioned speech, further emphasizing its point with intimidating slabs of bass and dissonant keyboards. This is a rare and welcome moment in which the group’s—and the L.A. jazz scene’s—implicit politics become explicit, when the ultra-technical veneer peels away to reveal righteous, but never quite unbridled, anger. We can imagine what other prompts may have guided Butterss through the making of Mighty Vertebrate. For “Lubbock,” perhaps, write a post-rock song that evokes the grand, arid landscape of West Texas. For “Ella,” soundtrack a gentle rainstorm. For “Dance Steve,” just let guest guitarist Parker shred. Each task is completed hyper-competently if dispassionately, creating a catalog of feats by a band that can seemingly do anything, remarkable in scope but lacking in focus. Mighty Vertebrate proves that Butterss can thrive in whatever world they find themself in. Now they just have to choose which one to conquer.

NxWorries,Why Lawd?,8.0,Pop/R&B,"In December 2020, Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge performed at the Double Happiness festival. The show was a livestream and the artists were isolated with no audience except the camera crew. “I hate it, bro. I want the people, I want the sweat,” Paak joked. But NxWorries squeezed plenty of fun out of their barely 10-minute set. Its most striking moment made it directly onto their second album, Why Lawd? “Stop playin’ wit’ my boy Knxwledge,” Paak shouts through reverb’d vocals, hyping up early single “Where I Go,” a smooth jam that equally channels early 2000s Monica and Knx’s WrapTaypes series. When the clip appears in the album version, it sounds grandiose yet humble. Paak and Knx have toured the world, sold out arenas, and worked with plenty of larger-than-life collaborators. But that stripped-back rendition of “Where I Go” contains both the intimacy of a steamy rendezvous and the focused showmanship of a band ready to shut down a 10,000-cap room. NxWorries’ 2016 debut, Yes Lawd!, was as carefree as a new-age mack daddy rap&B album could be. The billowing thump of Knxwledge’s exhaustive backlog of beat tapes blended well with Paak’s scratchy croon-raps, somewhere between Joe Tex and Black Dynamite with a taste for vegan sausage. Eight years on, with higher individual profiles, how would NxWorries recapture that patent-leather Air Force sheen? The sumptuous Why Lawd? not only succeeds, it expands their vision. The beats are more ambitious, the lyrics more thoughtful on subjects of affection, rejection, and coital bliss. They sound as enamored with having loved and lost as with the future joys and miseries just over the horizon. Yes Lawd! came to party and dash, but Why Lawd? takes a slightly more grown approach. The first proper track “86Sentra” starts out business as usual, with Paak dangling used cars in front of love interests and rapping about playing the Super Bowl over an ominous organ loop. On “MoveOn,” he contemplates the pain he’s put himself through by living recklessly. Then, as if to put that insight to the test, “KeepHer” fleshes out the story of an ex-wife determined to leave his bullshit for a new paramour, no matter how much money he throws her way. “He don’t love you the way I—/You don’t look good in that Hyundai,” he says, before begging her for farewell sex in the next verse. It’s rewarding to see his slimeball charm turned against him: Paak is rarely, if ever, on the business end of a breakup song. Why Lawd? savors these contrasts, adding new emotional layers to NxWorries’ jet-setting hijinks. Paak’s trademark smooth-talking Svengali routine is still in effect, but the breezy connects are few and far between; now, affairs are usually followed by the sting of denial or the nagging doubts of age. The dramatic synthwave gestures of “Daydreaming” lead into the 3 a.m. drunken car sobbing of “FromHere,” a rakish torch song worthy of the Stylistics. While this isn’t a concept album, the songs feel connected, as if each were an episode of your favorite romantic dramedy. “HereIAm” plays like a funeral dirge, mournful organs echoing Paak’s melancholic scroll through an ex’s Instagram before bleeding into “OutTheWay,” where rattling drums and pastel synths signal budding new love. These vignettes aren’t just teeming with personality missing from more precisely manufactured work like Oxnard or the soul cosplay of Paak and Bruno Mars’ An Evening With Silk Sonic; they sketch out a portrait of Paak as a father, son, divorcé, lover, and freak aspiring to keep his streak alive. Knxwledge supplies Paak with some of the most breathtaking production of his career. The beats on Why Lawd? are ornately constructed, each a treasure hunt for the tell that it’s all made from tiny bits of other songs. Knx’s hazy lo-fi aesthetic has always operated at an epic scale, but his love for gospel, soul, and doo-wop has helped his beats grow into more elegant shapes. While many of these confections are refined takes on ideas from his 2020 solo album 1988 or the later volumes in his woefully discontinued Meek Mill remix series, the genre excursions offer the album’s biggest surprises. “Daydreaming,” with its synthwave saturation and closing guitar solo, wouldn’t feel out of place on Miami Vice. “FromHere” and “DistantSpace” don’t sound like homages to the Temptations and Motown; they sound plucked from the shelves of Berry Gordy’s office and looped and drum-tracked to perfection. Knx and Paak wear their reverence to the classics on their sleeves, but Why Lawd? never strays far from its dirty swinging rap&B center. The two of them could’ve used nostalgia to coast on the legacy of their nearly decade-old debut to turn in a serviceable redux. Instead, Why Lawd? leans into a rawness and fear Yes Lawd! only hinted at. No one is immune to getting curved. Loneliness can supersede all the money and hook-ups in the world. Putting that reality front and center is a bold shift from the first album’s devil-may-care attitude, and makes for caramel-rich music that nods to the duo’s idols while forging its own groove. “Who would ever think that we’d find a hole in the system?” Paak asks over a rattling drum break and guitar riff on “Battlefield,” a song that begins with assured autobiography and ends with a joke involving a fling that lasts barely as long as a Dodgers game. Leave it to NxWorries to find the beauty in the bruises. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

200 Stab Wounds,Manual Manic Procedures,7.6,Metal,"Fun isn’t necessarily one of death metal’s chief attributes, but it’s one of the defining characteristics of 200 Stab Wounds; you don’t name your songs “Skin Milk” and “Stifling Stew” if you don’t enjoy playing around in the grotesque. (They say that the title “Release the Stench” was inspired by a bandmember slipping off his shoes in the van.) The Cleveland quartet’s 2021 debut, Slave to the Scalpel, was an immediately accessible album of gritty riffs and sinewy grooves in a cartoonishly gruesome sleeve, and it established 200 Stab Wounds within a new wave of death-metal bands like Creeping Death, Necrot, Undeath, and fellow Ohioans Sanguisugabogg—bands that use hardcore’s relentless forward thrust to power traditional death metal in the vein of genre heroes Cannibal Corpse and Bolt Thrower. The music is dark, ugly, compact, and covered in grime. If Blood Incantation’s brainy sound explores the cosmos, and Tomb Mold’s visionary approach pushes aesthetic frontiers, then 200 Stab Wounds’ sinister, concentrated music plumbs the Zodiac Killer’s basement. Slave to the Scalpel was recorded before 200 Stab Wounds began playing live, and its songs occasionally suffered from not having been road tested; there’s a fine line between relentless and monotonous that not even the nastiest riff can overcome. In the years since, they’ve toured ceaselessly with death-metal legends like Obituary and Dying Fetus, and it’s clear that hearing songs like “Slowly We Rot” and “Born in Sodom” every night for weeks—and discovering how their own music fared before a skeptical crowd—helped 200 Stab Wounds figure out how to turn a great riff into a great song. On Manual Manic Procedures, they chop their sound to pieces and sew it back up into meticulously arranged music played with speed, precision, and obvious glee; they’re inflicting all those wounds as efficiently as possible, but you can sense them enjoying each and every thrust of the knife. Right from the start, it’s clear that Manual Manic Procedures has been built to keep a crowd on its toes and a pit in perpetual motion. After an intro that recalls both “South of Heaven” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” the rhythm of opener “Hands of Eternity” changes five or six times in the span of a minute, from head-banging piston-pumping to thrashy swing to ’90s jock metal and back again; later in the song, they shift from a gallop into D-beat into a nu-metal drag. It’s nothing new for a metal band to combine subgenres, but making such a show of presenting the menu at the beginning of the meal shows the band’s fresh intent: Here are all the ways your body can and will respond to this record. 200 Stab Wounds pulls tricks like this throughout Manual Manic Procedures—setting patterns in motion, then upending them while you’re distracted by some musical sleight of hand. In “Defiled Gestation,” the missile scream of a pair of pinch harmonics flashes across the opening mid-tempo riff, and while you’re still partially blinded by the flare, the band pitches up the pace in mid-measure, launching into the song’s full-throttle attack a quarter-second or so earlier than it feels like they should. Even when they’re at cruising speed, they keep tinkering with the groove, finding new ways to voice the riff without losing momentum. Steve Buhl rips into “Release the Stench” with a melodic neon sneer of a solo that turns into a snarl before spinning out in aggression, his flailing knocking out the rest of the band and allowing them to reset the song as chopping sludge. While these newly intricate arrangements could come off as a fussy overcorrection, the sophistication of the songwriting makes the changes mostly feel natural rather than forced or showy. The title track scrolls from knuckle-dragging X Games groove to staccato grindcore and then into old-school death-metal riffing so elegantly, you sense it more as a change in tone—wound-up testosterone and clenched-teeth tension giving way to ecstatic release—than form. Andy Nelson’s rich, almost glossy production heightens the album’s fluidity. Without blowing the soundstage up to stadium proportions, the Weekend Nachos mastermind creates just enough space for the instruments to speak clearly to one another. The effect is like seeing being in a tiny club with a pristine sound system: When Buhl and Raymond MacDonald’s guitars chug together in “Gross Abuse,” the thickness is suffocating. They open things further in interlude “Led to the Chamber / Liquified,” whose light-blue keyboard melody haunts the track’s Argento abattoir synths like a naive specter. These are mostly subtle touches—minor adjustments to what was already a compelling aesthetic—that the band incorporates without sacrificing the swagger of Slave to the Scalpel. At times, listening to Manual Manic Procedures can feel like being put through a death-metal HIIT workout: 25 reps of two-stepping, 25 reps around the circle pit, 25 reps of headbanging, Keep up, let’s empty the tank for the wall of death! But by offering themselves up to the blood of the crowd and allowing it to reshape how they fashion their music, 200 Stab Wounds makes their priorities clear. Manual Manic Procedures is vicious in its attitude and surgical in its precision, but at its pulpy core, it’s an album that wants you to dance.

Chrystabell,Cellophane Memories,7.3,Pop/R&B / Experimental / Rock,"The presence of director David Lynch’s name atop the new Chrystabell album, Cellophane Memories, will attract curious ears it might not have otherwise. After a few listens, however, you may wonder less about what Lynch brought to the table, and more about why Chrystabell, a Texas-based singer, is credited just once. Cellophane Memories should be attributed not to Chrystabell but to Chrystabells, plural. The greatest virtue of this beautiful album is how it layers her voice over and over—and over—again. The opening of“With Small Animals” is a prime example of this collage effect—her vocal lines spin free from their ambiguous origin point like threads of an ever-fraying fabric. On “The Sky Falls,” the effect is more strategic, vaguely resembling a classical canon; the pacing of overlaps is ambiguous but still calculable. A synthesizer backdrop lends it an almost irritating texture, giving this seeming evanescence a uniquely off-kilter quality. Cellophane Memories may be pretty, but it’s not easy. On “Reflections in a Blade,” the vocal bits are harshly clipped, providing a fractured view of an uncertain whole. They flicker by, the patterning delicious, forming a jumbled mess of voices. Behind the chorus a lone synth hums, interspersed with what sounds like someone breathing through a saxophone. The majority of the songs have just an instrument or two in the background, but each selection reflects exquisite decision-making. And each production element firmly reflects Lynch’s presence. As a filmmaker, Lynch suffuses his work with sound, from the lush scores that Angelo Badalamenti provided for Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive, to the essential presence of pop songs, like those of Roy Orbison in Blue Velvet and Chris Isaak in Wild at Heart, all the way back to the radiator drones of his debut, Eraserhead. Lynch’s sonic hallmarks are everywhere on Cellophane Memories, from the earnest treacle of Badalamenti’s backing pads (the composer died in 2022, but is spiritually present here), to the tremolo-thick guitars of Orbison and Isaak, to the haunting rumble favored in his film sound designs. There are also mechanized rhythms—bone machine beats, à la Tom Waits—that bring to mind other Lynch pop forays, most notably his work with the late Julee Cruise, who died the same year as Badalamenti. Chrystabell doesn’t merely sing back-up for herself: The dovetailing of her vocals means you don’t always know what’s the main line, what’s an echo, and what’s an eerie backmasked premonition. Vocally, it’s clear that Cellophane Memories owes a debt to numerous gloomy and dreamy pop concoctions of the past, like Mazzy Star, Cowboy Junkies, Kate Bush, and Nico. There’s also a strong influence of art-pop forebear David Sylvian—whose dramatic, self-correcting melodic arcs she follows as if she wrote a dissertation on the subject. It’s difficult to listen to the layered vocals on Cellophane Memories and not think of the roles that mirrors and fractured identities play in Lynch films. The layering is so persistent that it’s unclear if that consistency signals conceptual coherence or extended sameness. As a listener, I came down a little more on the latter end of that continuum—over-consistency is the album’s main, perhaps sole, demerit—but it makes up for that sameness in countless other subtle, subconscious ways.

Spirit of the Beehive,You’ll Have to Lose Something,7.8,Rock,"There are two blood-curdling screams within the first 15 minutes of You’ll Have to Lose Something, the harrowing fifth album from Philadelphia psych-punks Spirit of the Beehive. Neither sits prominently in the mix, so they’re easy to miss amid the shapeshifting structures and shards of shattered noise. The first, wordless and caked in distortion, appears as the bottom falls out of opener “The Disruption,” settling like thick smoke over the rubble of the stoner-rock breakdown. The second, which interrupts the uncanny 1960s pop single “Let the Virgin Drive,” is more forceful, a shredded-throat plea for help that sounds as though it’s wafting up from a basement of horrors. In clammier hands, these moments would be bludgeons or cheap jumpscares, but Spirit of the Beehive weave them into their arrangements with a delicate touch. The way the band writes—stitching discordant sounds into a tangled, anxious whole—feels destabilizing but thoroughly considered, each spiky sample, effects-warped vocal take, or disquieting lyric placed just so. The sense of discomfort feels deliberate and well-earned, reflecting how maddening it feels to wake up and endure all over again. “It exists in everyday life,” band member Zach Schwartz recently told The Fader. “Daily anxieties are part of the human experience.” The band, founded by Schwartz and Rivka Ravede in 2014, started as a shoegaze act, seeking transcendence via pummeling din. By the time they released 2018’s Hypnic Jerks, they’d lowered the decibel level, settling into a mode more Rorschach than Ride. During pandemic lockdown Schwartz and his bandmates traded files to create 2021’s ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH, its hallucinatory and frenetic sprawl mimicking the endless wash of social media and advertising. Schwartz and Ravede, who’d been in a romantic relationship for over a decade, parted ways in 2022, throwing the band’s future into question. You’ll Have to Lose Something (as well as last fall’s EP i’m so lucky) is ostensibly a breakup album, though it’s less a collection of wallowing, where-did-it-go-wrong confessionals than an exploration of the confusion and terror that comes with suddenly entering a new phase of life. In this case, it’s three people trying to work out what it means when a romance, a working relationship, and a friendship simultaneously fail the stress test. In that same Fader interview, multi-instrumentalist Corey Wilchin explains how writing the album helped the trio process its new dynamic: “Collectively, we’re not the most communicative bunch…We’re writing about each other and what we’re going through when we can’t talk about things or don’t want to talk about them.” “Devotion is a cancer,” Ravede sings during the Deerhunter psychedelia of “Stranger Alive.” Once it shifts into a brawny krautrock groove, Schwartz responds, “The path behind you is lit from the side.” There are perspectives and angles only understood in hindsight. The band’s cut-and-paste aesthetic lends itself well to such psychic excavation, but they’ve taken a less antagonistic approach here. Despite the twists and turns, You’ll Have to Lose Something is some of the prettiest music the band has put to tape. The lurking anger and fear remain, just wrapped in softer sonics. “Found a Body” splits the difference between quiet storm R&B and ’90s trip hop, plumes of dreamy synth drifting around a cyclical drum pattern like morning fog on a lake. Wilchin and Ravede’s voices intertwine in gorgeous harmony, masking the horror of lyrics that describe discovering a corpse and hiding from a stalking, unknown force. Almost every track teems with warped, sticky hooks. There’s the Auto-Tuned Roy Orbinson melody Wilchin croons throughout “Let the Virgin Drive,” the barbed Autolux coo in the middle of “Duplicate Spotted.” On “1/500,” when Schwartz belts, “What if a photo doesn’t capture time?” surrounded by horns and jingling tambourines, there’s a triumphant, Springsteen-esque energy. Though the dreamy atmosphere and embrace of pop formalism make for the band’s most accessible record, You’ll Have to Lose Something is still profoundly challenging. It takes a few listens to make sense of it, to know when a transition marks the end of a song or one of its movements. The band talked about a desire to take fewer sharp turns when composing these pieces, and though it charts a craggy path, this album is more straightforward and less labyrinthine than either ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH or Hypnic Jerks. But life offers no clean lines, no direct routes. It’s messy and jagged, full of detours and unexpected hazards. Eventually—hopefully—you develop a way to steady yourself in the maelstrom.

Cults,To the Ghosts,6.0,Rock,"Joe Meek had an ear for greatness and a brain hellbent on destroying it. Often considered the British counterpart to American pop production legend Phil Spector, he composed most of his biggest hits holed up in a three-floor Islington flat above a leather goods store. He was fascinated with early electronic music and esoteric necromancy in equal measure; he famously dismissed the talents of a young Rod Stewart and called the Beatles “rubbish.” When he had enough of his landlady’s pestering about the ruckus he was making upstairs, he turned a shotgun on her, then himself. After his death, archivists found thousands of recordings he deemed unsuitable for public release, including songs he created for David Bowie. In his quest to create a sound bigger than himself, Meek sabotaged his success in the name of his own exacting standards. When Brian Oblivion and Madeline Follin first formed Cults over a decade ago, the two bonded over a shared interest in Meek’s musicality and madness, the way the first begot the second. Since their 2011 debut, the New York City duo has channeled that influence into girl group gems with a sinister underbelly, writing songs about haunted houses that went down easy thanks to Oblivion’s twinkling piano and Follin’s helium-high vocal harmonies. On their latest album, To the Ghosts, Cults lean into the bleak beauty of Meek’s story, attempting to channel the darkness in his DayGlo melodies. Five albums in, Cults sound just as eerie and cheery as ever but struggle to transcend the fleeting pleasantries of paint-by-numbers pop. Lest we forget their influences, the album opens with an echoing bell reminiscent of Spector’s biggest hits with the Ronettes. That song, “Crybaby,” does little to advance the band’s sound: From rhymes about an immature lover so facile they approach parody to synth melodies that feel recycled from previous albums, it sets the predictable tone of the record. When their songwriting does venture to new territory, it usually runs into an awkward metaphor, as when Follin waxes poetic about apoptosis on “Cells” or contemplates why onions make her cry on “Onions” (it’s the sulfur). The repetitive palette highlights why Spector’s groups transcended the march of time while Cults sound dated on arrival: Follin’s voice simply doesn’t carry the texture or technique of singers like the Shangri-Las’ Mary Weiss or the Crystals’ Dolores “Dee Dee” Kenniebrew. Across the album’s 13 songs, her voice strains against the band’s layered production (helmed by Follin and Oblivion, along with producer Shane Stoneback), fighting a losing battle against a particularly dense guitar riff on “Leave Home” and rushing to keep up with the propulsive electronics of “Behave.” Layered vocal harmonies prevent her voice from falling into the background completely, but her parts often feel like an afterthought. To the Ghosts is most promising when Cults veer from their girl group inspirations and experiment with dissonance on songs like “Eat It Cold,” with its descending minor scales, fluttering synths, low kick drums, and twisting vocal inflections. Ironically, the band constructs the most engaging potential future on a song that speaks literally of retreading one’s past. As a guitar plucks out a winding melody in its final third, the band recalls the spellbinding sounds that made Joe Meek’s productions so instantly memorable. But with too few new ideas, Cults risk simply embellishing on the well-trodden melodies of their inspirations, too consumed by creating an immortal pop song to let it live in the moment.

Belong,Realistic IX,7.4,Electronic / Jazz / Rock,"Belong’s music has evolved gradually across two decades of sporadic activity, moving from their abstract drone beginnings toward something resembling actual rock songs. At times, the change seems to have crept up on them. Speaking with an interviewer around the release of their second full-length, 2011’s gothic, expansive Common Era, the New Orleans duo expressed a note of bafflement about the way the album was landing. “People have been citing shoegaze a lot in reference to the new album and that actually took us a bit by surprise,” said Turk Dietrich, adding, “We don’t feel any relation in aesthetic, harmonically or sonically, to most of the artists from the early ’90s shoegaze movement.” If Deitrich and his bandmate Mike Jones once struggled to hear the influence of shoegaze on their music, 13 years later, they seem to have come around to the idea. The duo’s third album, Realistic IX, doesn’t necessarily sound influenced by the shoegaze movement as a whole; it sounds inspired principally by the shoegaze band, My Bloody Valentine—specifically their landmark 1991 album Loveless. Hit play on the album’s opening track, “Realistic (I’m Still Waiting),” and it’s all there right from the jump: the gauzy, smudged guitar riffs; the androgynous angel sighs; that general sense of warp and weft, as if the track itself was being bent out of shape by a gigantic tremolo arm. Living rent-free in another group’s soundworld is seldom a good look—particularly when it’s as distinctive as the one Kevin Shields created. But Dietrich and Jones are seasoned sculptors of sound, with an instinctive grasp of layering textures and shaping feedback. And whereas much of the current crop of shoegaze revivalists approach the sound in a somewhat basic way—bit of fuzz on the guitars, check; vague sense of ennui in the vocals, check—on Realistic IX, Belong have locked on better than most to My Bloody Valentine’s alien side: that vaporous, synthetic quality that made Loveless feel untethered from familiar rock’n’roll touchstones and adrift in the direction of something new. Luckily, Belong are canny enough not to recreate My Bloody Valentine’s masterwork stroke by stroke. Dietrich and Jones approach the Loveless formula with intent, like detectives reopening a cold case and sifting the evidence in search of a new way forward. Where Loveless featured live drums—albeit sampled and extensively reassembled by Shields—Belong make use of drum machines, giving their rhythms a blockier, more mechanistic feel. And while Loveless’ lyrics are famously hard to parse, Realistic IX takes the spirit of obfuscation further still. “Souvenir” and “Jealousy” follow a familiar verse-chorus progression, but the blurred-out vocals are wholly unintelligible, deployed purely for their sound and feel. Indeed, you get the sense that Dietrich and Jones remain drone to the bone, seeking moments of epiphany not in the stuff of songcraft but in the careful manipulation of texture and tone. The result is some distinctly other sounding music. “Difficult Boy” crackles with a strange, synthetic intensity, its swerving shoegaze chords spliced to a pounding, machine-like rhythm reminiscent of Suicide. “Bleach” sets a drum machine in orbit around a roar of psychedelic harsh noise. Two standout tracks explicitly reference electronic dance music. “Crucial Years” imagines an alternate reality in which Shields got really into the dub techno of Basic Channel or Pole, underpinning grainy washes of feedback with stuttering pulsations, while the closing “AM/PM” chains its airy drones to a four-to-the-floor rhythm—a simple enough idea, but it works like a charm. In the hands of a more opportunistic band, this sort of pivot towards shoegaze in the year 2024 might feel like an attempt to elbow their way into the TikTok zeitgeist in the hope of scoring some sort of viral payday. But it seems unlikely that Belong, long content to remain in the shadows, care a jot for any of that; they appear interested mainly in bending rock music to its breaking point. Realistic IX doesn’t entirely land. Belong’s taste for blurry abstraction means the album sometimes sounds slightly undercooked, like a set of production sketches awaiting further embellishment. And the debt it owes to its influences dilutes any shock of the new. But it takes skill and a degree of daring to riff on an album as monumental as Loveless—hell, it took Kevin Shields himself over 20 years to follow it up. That Belong can not just pull off that template but build on it is an accomplishment in itself.",0,"August 10, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/belong-realistic-ix/
Tashi Wada,What Is Not Strange?,7.8,,"Tashi Wada was born into the avant-garde. Growing up in a building shared by Fluxus artists, Wada lived next door to the choreographer Simone Forti. Video artist Nam June Paik was in the apartment upstairs. His father, legendary composer Yoshi Wada, worked as a plumber by day and an artist by night, stretching the limits of minimalism by incorporating Scottish bagpipes and Indian ragas. Tashi’s own work is rarely described without reference to those pioneering drones, but he shrugs off questions about paternal influence. “Sometimes I have a sense of how my work is perceived in relation to my father’s, but I tend to limit my understanding to my own personal space and how I feel about it,” he said in a 2019 interview. “I leave the rest to the world to sort out.” While the younger Wada’s musical output is certainly related to the elder’s, it’s no imitation. Yoshi tended toward grand gestures, recording bagpipes in an empty swimming pool or composing for startlingly loud auditory flares normally used for nautical emergencies. Tashi is more academic, preferring to generate microtones with unusual tuning systems rather than through massive volume. After studying with James Tenney, he forged a link between the Fluxus movement and a newer generation of artists centered around the CalArts music program. The 2018 album Nue, credited to Tashi Wada with Yoshi Wada and Friends, represented a passing of the torch: Yoshi and Forti featured alongside CalArts alums Julia Holter and Corey Fogel. With What Is Not Strange?, Wada takes the next step, moving from the periphery of his father’s community to the center of his own and demonstrating a newfound maturity as a composer in the process. The biggest surprise here is that Wada has written honest-to-goodness songs, albeit rather strange ones. This shift is due in part to life events that drew him away from abstraction and toward more expressive forms. In the years after Nue, Yoshi passed away and Tashi had a child with Holter, his partner. “Grand Trine,” a sprightly chamber-pop number, celebrates their daughter. Its title refers to three planets forming an equilateral triangle on her astrological chart, but the trio of father, mother, and daughter is clearly the song’s subject. “She is my star,” Holter croons over elegant harpsichord and strings. The instrumentation leaps to abrupt climaxes only to fade away again and again, like surges of joy that dissipate only to return with renewed vigor. But the mood is troubled in the following song, “Revealed Night,” which is built on an urban field recording of sirens in the distance, evoking the pandemic into which she was born. The microtonal minimalism of Wada’s early compositions appears as well. The back half of the album drifts away from song-based pieces into an ocean of drones that uneasily ebbs and flows, with seasick synths tuned in an obscure 18th-century temperament that makes even a triumphant crescendo sound dissonant to modern ears. The nadir of this section is “Calling,” a dead-calm wash of strings and synths, but the wave crests again with “Plume,” which patiently builds into a dramatically spiraling finale. Wada is best as a bandleader who lets his extensive knowledge of alternate tunings inform, rather than dictate, the shape of his tracks. At times, he trades his austere minimalism for rambunctious maximalism, letting his bandmates—experienced noise-makers all—explore the parameters he has set. “Flame of Perfect Form” is a sizzling freeform workout that, at its peak, recalls the psychedelic barrage of Acid Mothers Temple, while “Subaru” deploys just intonation in the service of a slightly off-kilter earworm melody that’s all the more memorable for its odd tonal character. The album ends with “This World’s Beauty,” a delicate miniature that again combines Holter’s vocals with Wada’s harpsichord. Its graceful and compact form, just 1:40 long, is the closest to a standard verse-chorus-verse tune in Wada’s discography. But on an album full of surprising detours, it represents his breakthrough: a simple statement of purpose from a composer newly confident in his abilities. With What Is Not Strange?, Wada honors his father’s legacy, but he also begins to carve out his own. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Frankie Goes to Hollywood,Welcome to the Pleasuredome,8.7,Rock,"Think of the flush that must have crept over Mike Read’s face the moment he realized that when Frankie sang “come,” they meant cum. Pupils and capillaries dilated, he must have scanned the lyrics printed on the sleeve of “Relax” and read the word “suck” as if for the first time in his life. By the time the BBC 1 Radio DJ declared the song “obscene” on air, “Relax” had already become a mainstay on his station—contemporary estimates say it played 70 to 100 times in six weeks—extolling the pleasures of gay sex to some thousands of unsuspecting listeners. Eleven days into 1984, “Relax” fluttered to No. 6 on the UK charts. Yanked from airplay, it soared to the top by the end of the month. The tale of Read’s sudden panic quickly grew. Before long, he hadn’t just declined to play the single on his hit countdown show; he had dragged the needle off the disc halfway through its runtime and banned it on the spot. Depending on who’s telling the story, he also either flung the record against the wall or snapped it over his knee. For his part, Read claims he wasn’t all that bothered; he simply ran out of airtime. But he will concede that he noticed some “vile words” and a “simulated phallus” printed on the cover, and he did indeed pronounce the whole thing obscene. While he didn’t have the authority to ban “Relax” from broadcast himself, Read’s declaration made its way up the chain, scandalizing BBC executives as it went. Apparently, it had never occurred to them that “come” meant anything other than showing up. “The group seemed to confirm [the lyrics] as referring to fellatio and ejaculation, which are not exactly subjects which I think are appropriate for broadcasting on the radio,” said Derek Chinnery, BBC 1 Controller, two weeks after Read’s proclamation. “We could have said there is a dual meaning to this song, that it was a kind of nonsense lyric about relaxing. But when the performers themselves confirmed that it was referring to these sexual aberrations then it didn’t seem to me appropriate that we should play it at all.” That day, the BBC learned a key lesson: If you don’t know what a song is about, it’s probably about sex. And if you’re certain a song is about nothing, it’s definitely about sex. “Relax,” the crown jewel in Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s debut album, Welcome to the Pleasuredome, went largely unnoticed for the first three months after its release in the fall of 1983. An irresistible performance on the Top of the Pops’ 20th-anniversary show catapulted the single into public consciousness: Lead singer Holly Johnson vamped along to its pre-recorded studio glitz dressed in leather and flagging piss, while his co-vocalist Paul Rutherford—the handsome clone to Johnson’s charismatic scamp—danced as if he had just stumbled into the eighth discotheque of the night. The BBC fracas cemented the song’s illicit appeal. Everything that was supposed to nip a music career in the bud—politics, overproduction, overt homosexuality, censorship—only poured fuel on Frankie’s fire. The band spent months frothing up clubs in their native Liverpool, cultivating a leather-and-chains look they swore owed more to Mad Max’s road warriors than any particular fetish scene. “We really had to hit hard to get off the streets … to create a reaction, especially in Liverpool because there’s so many bands,” Johnson told NME. “To stand out we had to give it loads, loads of sex because that was the easiest and quickest shocker to get attention.” They revved into gear in February 1983, when they snagged a slot on the music TV program The Tube. Wearing mesh crop tops, they banged out an embryonic rendition of “Relax,” then a bare-bones funk ditty that interpolated the Lady in the Radiator song from Eraserhead. Among their viewers was producer Trevor Horn, the studio wizard behind era-defining hits like the Buggles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star” and Yes’ “Owner of a Lonely Heart.” He had just launched a new label called Zang Tuum Tumb with his wife Jill Sinclair, former NME writer Paul Morley, and fellow producer Gary Langan. A few weeks later, Horn heard a more developed version of “Relax” on David “Kid” Jensen’s Radio 1 show. Impressed, he started calling around to sign Frankie. They had the spark; he had the finesse that could coax it into an inferno. ZTT’s parent company, Island Records, had previously passed up a chance to add Frankie to their roster, claiming, ambiguously, “They don’t have the right image.” Horn and Morley, meanwhile, saw a path to the promised land paved in leather. On both sides of the Atlantic, listeners hungered for an electronic sound that overpowered the senses. In the first few years of the decade, New York acts like Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel, and Afrika Bambaataa dreamed up electro tracks that heralded cyborg futures, while in San Francisco, Sylvester and Patrick Cowley pitched disco into a new, accelerated lane. Aesthetically glamorous, sexually ambiguous bands like Culture Club, Soft Cell, and Eurythmics were taking the new audiovisual arena of MTV by storm, ushering in what would be dubbed the second British Invasion. But where Boy George and Marc Almond tended to dodge direct questions about their personal sexualities, Frankie’s two vocalists left the closet far behind. (The rest of the band—Brian Nash, Peter Gill, and Mark O’Toole, collectively known as “the lads”—were straight.) ”[Horn] thought the gay thing was the most dangerous thing about us, but he loved that,” said Rutherford. Morley agreed it was ZTT’s job to inflame Frankie’s most scandalous appeal: “What a record company should do is exaggerate the raw material of its artists; most companies remove or reduce it.” For months, Frankie and Horn worked “Relax” from a libidinal sketch into an erotic phantasmagoria. Horn had at his disposal a Fairlight CMI, the nascent digital audio workstation newly favored by Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, and Peter Gabriel. “He was one of about three people in England who owned and knew how to use a Fairlight computer synthesizer,” said Rutherford. The machine enabled precise visual sequencing; you could etch melodies and rhythmic patterns directly on the screen with a light pen. It was also the first commercially available digital sampler that could record sounds directly into the machine and play them back at any pitch on the keyboard. Working with a slew of session musicians, Horn teased layers and layers of outré sound out of the Fairlight—a deliciously sleazy three-note bass strut, candied digital horns, a constellation of syncopated percussion—all building toward a crescendo he called “the orgasm effect.” “I imagined it was dawn, Holly had climbed to the top of a mosque, held his arms in the air and called all of these hordes forward to have sex with him,” he said. “I put a huge orgasm in the middle, the biggest orgasm anybody had ever been had by anybody.” It worked. “Relax” satisfied listeners starving for sound that walloped them more than it washed over them. It also sent the competition scrambling. Early synth advocate Gary Numan said the single “plunged me into a pit of despair. The production was so good, the sounds so classy, that it seemed to move the entire recording business up a gear—we were all left floundering, trying to catch up.” While Horn and the band toiled away on Frankie’s sound, Morley began crafting an equally infectious media campaign. Riffing on Katharine Hamnett’s “Choose Life” design (a reference to Buddhism, not abortion), he penned a sequence of enigmatic slogans and printed them on blank white T-shirts in big, black letters: Frankie say relax. Frankie say war! Hide yourself. Frankie say arm the unemployed. Morley himself liked to wear a T-shirt that said, “Propaganda will give you the truth.” In interviews, he was equally prone to sloganeering: “I condemned [manipulation] when it was done badly. Great manipulation I adore.” By the summer of ’84, the shirts were everywhere—a fad, sure, but also a prescient bit of agitprop. Ubiquitous directives with no clear authority behind them might make you wonder about your susceptibility to authority’s tools in general. Frankie’s second single, the anti-war rumble “Two Tribes,” debuted at No. 1 in June 1984. With Frankiemania at a fever pitch, the natural next step was to let the band play across an album’s length—and with their prefab grandiosity, it only made sense that their debut LP would sprawl across two discs, an opulent oasis in the midst of Thatcherite austerity. Despite their cultural hold, Frankie still had a lot to prove. Naysayers claimed they were too polished, too glossy; all style, no substance; industry puppets lending their pretty faces to Horn’s studio indulgence. “We get a lot of interviews where people say, ‘We hear that you can’t play your instruments and that you were totally created by Trevor Horn,’” complained Johnson. “It’s so tedious for us, and it makes us resent the record company, which is not a healthy situation. ZTT didn’t go out of their way to deny the rumors, because it’s to their advantage for people to believe that they are wondrous Svengalis.” Welcome to the Pleasuredome would only further polarize their reception. Released at the end of October 1984, it boasted tauter versions of “Relax” and “Two Tribes” than the luxuriant 12"" mixes that had been ringing out in clubs all summer. Its title track, meanwhile, swelled to a tumescent 14 minutes, rooted in a shuddering bass groove: a glimmering showcase of Horn’s studio prowess and a hearty welcome indeed. A clutch of cover songs deepened the band’s complex love affair with the United States. They had never visited the country, but its cultural stranglehold fascinated them; they named themselves after an advertisement for Frank Sinatra’s first film role, while Johnson took his given name from Warhol superstar Holly Woodlawn. Frankie raced through Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run” at 157 BPM, faithfully took on Dionne Warwick’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose,” and sprawled across a hi-NRG version of Edwin Starr’s “War,” where they tasked a Ronald Reagan impressionist with reading both a Hitler quote about beauty and a meditation on revolutionary love by Marxist thinker David Cooper. (Cooper also wrote the mock-posh dissection of what an orgasm really is on the footnote track “Tag.”) Rather than a direct protest against imperial brutality, Frankie’s “War” seemed to blare a warning about the evolving nature of power in an era where cable television advertised both the threat of nuclear armageddon and a spread of convenient options for escaping its attendant stress. A seasoned actor sat in the White House and the news became just another product for the masses to consume. While some were quick to label Pleasuredome an instant masterpiece, for certain critics, the glaze over Frankie’s political and literary convictions cracked on impact. Creem pronounced it a “put-on and a con, a flim-flam scam of a sham, a hip hype calculated solely to separate as much money as possible from as many people as possible as fast as possible before all the young rubes wake up and realize they’ve been fleeced.” Record called it “stagey and sophomoric,” reiterating the suspicion that Frankie were no more than “puppets for ZTT masterminds.” They had a right to be skeptical; half the sounds on the album poured out of a machine that had only been on the market for five years, and Horn was one of only a few producers who knew how to deploy it to its full potential. If you took the measure of a band by how long they spent wrangling their own gear, Frankie fell short—no more than a handful of pinballs bouncing around ZTT’s brilliant machine. It’s true that there are oceans between that first scrappy Tube performance and the sumptuous opera that unfurled inside Pleasuredome. But Johnson’s electricity—his knowing poise, the twinkle in his eye, the ripples in his voice—surges through Pleasuredome’s entire lifespan, from demo to marquee. He’s as much in love with the camera on the Tube spot as he is in the first Bacchanalian video for “Relax,” which, among other delights, shows him soaking up a golden shower in a subterranean fetish club. (Naturally, the clip was also banned from the BBC and never cleared to air on MTV.) Listen to the way he trills his Rs on the word “erect” in “Welcome to the Pleasuredome,” or the vibrato he relishes for measures on end on “Black Night White Light,” and any thought of his emptiness shrivels up. Only a music press that discounted the power of performance itself—that shunted voice, presence, and attitude off to the side in favor of technical dexterity—would dare call him a puppet. The same media preoccupied with who played which instruments in the studio also harbored a phobia of pleasure itself, especially in combination with politics. But against a dreary backdrop of privatization, plague, deprivation, and shame, what choice did Frankie have but to dazzle? Their politics were in their citations of revolutionary figures and also gleamed across “Krisco Kisses,” a paean to fisting: “You fit me like a glove, my love/You fit me like a glove!” Pleasuredome rang out into the years that followed, emblematizing the ’80s and loosening the way for bands like Erasure, who would carry a similar torch into the rave years. The album turned out to be the apex of Frankie’s short-lived career. They followed it in 1986 with Liverpool, which flopped, and disbanded in the wake of intra-band aesthetic conflict and legal scuffles with ZTT—a by-the-books demise. But for a season, Frankie Goes to Hollywood pierced through the clouds on the back of the most thunderous orgasm anyone had ever heard. It didn’t take long for the sex and the thrill of the music to evaporate from collective memory. By the fall of ’84, parody T-shirts poked fun at the sheer ubiquity of Morley’s originals: Who give a Sh!t what Frankie say?, they read. By 1997, a Frankie Say Relax shirt prompted uproarious canned laughter all by itself on an episode of Friends—a symbol of a bygone media obsession. Four years later, Zoolander laundered “Relax” into a gag of its own. Once a scandal and a threat, the song deflated into the non-referential gibberish the BBC had first assumed it to be. Frankie’s eroticism, formerly a tidal force, trickled away into sterile nostalgia. But this story isn’t only about sex. Pleasuredome culminates in Frankie’s left-turn third single, an undanceable ballad the label marketed as a Christmas song, complete with a Nativity pageant video. On “The Power of Love,” the band swan-dives into total, unblemished sincerity: no cheek, no wink. From the depths, Johnson sings of real, obliterating love, the kind of love that atomizes and rearranges reality, the kind of love that has nothing to do with property, propriety, or ownership, and everything to do with surrender. He calls it “death-defying.” What a gift that “The Power of Love” came about more than a full decade before the dawn of Auto-Tune. You can hear Johnson striving for these notes; landing flat, hearing his failure, and correcting; hoisting himself up microtone by microtone to each sublime plateau. Frankie arrived in a splash of scandal, pressurizing dancefloors with euphoric club mixes. With “The Power of Love,” they also insisted that sexual and spiritual ecstasies need not be mutually exclusive. Far from it—they feed each other. Slipping a fist into your beloved could be a more fervent act of love than slipping on a ring before God. Instances of mind-wiping abandon crystallize into the highest devotion: love unbound by time or space. Pleasure, from music or sex or both, didn’t trivialize true feeling. It bored a hole into the heart of it. Additional research by Deirdre McCabe Nolan.",0,"June 23, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/frankie-goes-to-hollywood-welcome-to-the-pleasuredome/
Dame Area,Toda la verdad sobre Dame Area,7.7,Electronic,"When Suicide were playing piss-stained clubs in the 1970s, they did so in fear for their very lives. Their hostile, slow-burning synth-punk infuriated some concertgoers so much that singer Alan Vega and keyboardist Martin Rev got accustomed to dodging airborne objects. Bottles on a good night. Rocks, occasionally. And one time: an ax. Barcelona experimental duo Dame Area, who count Suicide among their chief influences, might have met the same fate had they not emerged decades later from Màgia Roja, an underground club, label, and creative incubator that shuttered in 2019. Co-founded by Dame Area producer Viktor Lux Crux five years prior, Màgia Roja’s 100-capacity venue was so welcoming—of punks, visual artists, hippies, suits—that performers weren’t even elevated on a stage; they were on the ground with everybody else. Crux met Dame Area vocalist Silvia Konstance when they were working and living at Màgia Roja, and the two started churning out demos in 2017. Across a handful of albums and EPs, they’ve drawn upon a dynamic set of styles: early industrial like Throbbing Gristle, Nurse With Wound, and Einstürzende Neubauten; Franco Battiato’s electro-lounge period; even an unlikely Italian opera piece that informed their 2018 release Centro di Gravitá. Dame Area’s voracious approach to genre seems directly linked to the time they spent under Màgia Roja’s roof, sweating alongside various subcultures. In 2022, Konstance and Crux even went pop…ish. Toda la mentira sobre Dame Area (All the Lies About Dame Area) is a chrome-sleek hybrid of new wave à la Gary Numan, Italo disco, and synth arpeggios fit for a bender at Berghain. For their new companion LP, Toda la verdad sobre Dame Area (The Whole Truth About Dame Area), Crux and Konstance take a crowbar to that polished exterior and produce their rawest sound yet. Toda la verdad, which clocks in at a bracing 36 minutes, bottles the jagged ferocity of Dame Area’s live shows. Their armory of synths and drum pads mimic everything from bashed trash-can lids to a dentist drill to a machine gun emptying its magazine. Konstance—who sings in her native Italian, as well as Spanish, Turkish, and German—can sound chipper and childlike in one breath and demonic in the next. On Toda la verdad she leans into the rage, yelping and snarling like a wounded animal on “Striscia,” and screaming like a blast of TV static on “Devoción.” “How can I do it without power?/I’ve decided: I’ll learn to burn, I’ll learn to bite,” Konstance belts in Spanish on searing opener “Si no es hoy cuándo es.” Crux amplifies her wrath with buzzsaw synths and blast-beat percussion. A handful of distinct sounds recur throughout Toda la verdad. Both “Si no es hoy cuándo es” and “Sempre cambiare” deploy grit-coated synth progressions recalling Martin Rev’s processed Farfisa. An unnerving, chopper-like drone that nods to Throbbing Gristle’s “Hamburger Lady” bubbles up occasionally. Digital debris—like simulations of car alarms and clinking chains and clanging pipes—whips around the perimeter of “Urlo di guerra.” But one of the album’s most prominent sounds, a gnarly metallic screech you’d hear in the bowels of a construction site, is the byproduct of a homemade contraption—a sheet of perforated metal that doubles as percussion and a controlled noise generator. Konstance scrapes it with her microphone, screams into it, and stabs a drumstick in and out of its holes in a motion that connotes rushed fucking. The nameless instrument is all over Toda la verdad, cropping up on “Tú me hiciste creer,” “Vengo dall’aldilà,” “Sempre cambiare,” and elsewhere. It’s a perfect encapsulation of Dame Area’s method: They are calculated and full of intent, but also spontaneous and innovative. Perhaps the most compelling thing about Dame Area is how fearlessly they incorporate pop and regional folk elements into corrosive synth-punk. Rather than Xeroxing the stark industrial template that emerged in the mid-’70s, Dame Area inject a bright vocal melody here, a Muzak “flute” trill there. The propulsive “Vengo dall’aldilà” is the peak of Dame Area’s ingenuity. They stack a pummeling flamenco rhythm with live percussion and Hitchcockian string stabs. As the song gallops forward, Konstance fires off a series of vocal pulses in time with the dense palmas, which by now sound like battle drums. Even when mutated with industrial production techniques, the rhythmic structure of flamenco is so captivating that “Vengo dall’aldilà” feels at once like the birth of a thrilling new style—and one that’s as primal as a heartbeat.",0,"September 21, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dame-area-toda-la-verdad-sobre-dame-area/
Les Savy Fav,"OUI, LSF",7.0,Rock,"It’s always ironic hearing Tim Harrington sing pleas for human connection after a career spent exemplifying the very qualities most likely to drive others away. The megaphone-voiced frontman of Les Savy Fav quills the band’s art-punk with brash volume and hectoring sarcasm. At the band’s legendarily rambunctious live shows, he sacrifices safety and dignity alike for the sake of an unforgettable spectacle. He’s as naturally gifted a showman as punk singers come, and one of the last guys you’d assume is all that concerned with whether or not he’s dating material. Nonetheless, as Les Savy Fav have aged into an institution, Harrington has increasingly exposed his softer side, writing often about the difficulty of maintaining close personal relationships. It can be odd, hearing the same wildman famed for stripping down to a Speedo on stage and scaling the tallest object within sight earnestly sing lines like, “It’s hard to let love in when we’re so scared of getting hurt” on the group’s sixth album OUI, LSF (on a song titled “Somebody Needs a Hug,” at that).Released after a 14-year recording hiatus during which the group occasionally toured but mostly focused on their day jobs, including bassist Syd Butler and guitarist Seth Jabour’s gigs anchoring the unlikely house band for Late Night with Seth Meyers, OUI, LSF continues the sentimental streak that ran through its predecessor, Root for Ruin. On the tender “Dawn Patrol,” Harrington finds solace in the reassuring touch of his partner’s hand. In its somber counterpart “Don’t Mind Me,” he croons about love that’s faded into mere tolerance over time. It’s the most naked, openly weepy ballad he’s ever attempted.One could argue that Harrington’s growing sincerity has made Les Savy Fav a better-rounded band. It’s certainly given them a wider range of moods. Yet as with Root for Ruin, OUI, LSF can’t completely shake the sense that its comedown songs are taking up space that could have been filled by bangers. Thankfully, this band can still rage convincingly when it counts: The album opens with an absolute pressure cooker, “Guzzle Blood,” which funnels their heated art-rock through the Prodigy’s five-alarm noise factory, all bleating squall and blaring horns. “Void Moon” and “Oi! Division” are both economical pit-starters, showcases for searing riffs and Harrington’s frontman-as-Russian-roulette volatility. At times, the maturity flatters. One of Harrington’s periodic forays into Penthouse Forum territory, “Limo Scene,” calls back to the lurid sex of “The Equestrian,” but this time amid all the touching and pheromones, the detail he lingers on is a simple gesture of consent and affirmation, a whispered “I’m into this.” The album’s stabs at youthful irreverence are less graceful. With its hokey appropriations of old LL Cool J and Usher lyrics, “Legendary Tippers” pushes the band into stale dad-joke territory. It’s a nod to an earlier, sillier era of the band, a past they can’t fully let go of even though they’ve outgrown it.Like their peer Marnie Stern, who returned from a similarly long studio hiatus last year with an album that picked up exactly where the last one left off, Les Savy Fav aren’t humoring any notions of reinvention. When you’ve got a sound this singular, this established, this irreplicable, there’s no shame in letting it ride. Still, given how time has always intrigued Les Savy Fav—their essential 2004 compilation Inches flaunted their evolution by collecting seven years of singles in reverse chronological order —it’s a little disappointing that the latest album doesn’t have more to show for the passage of so much of it. Twice the span that Inches documented has elapsed since Root for Ruin, yet OUI, LSF plays more like a continuation than a new chapter.

I. JORDAN,I AM JORDAN,6.6,Electronic,"When I. JORDAN spoke to Pitchfork in 2020, they weren’t getting their hopes up about the future. Their lofty ambition was to live in Berlin—“like every other DJ”—but they doubted they’d ever be successful enough to make that viable. They were, of course, being modest. By then, Jordan had already released a string of EPs that gushed with energy and emotion, blending UK rave styles with trance and the sunny thump of French house. Crucially, there was a personal element, too. 2020’s For You was a dedication to their younger self, an out-of-place queer teenager in the working-class northern English town of Doncaster. Four years later, Jordan has blown past those early doubts. Since 2021, they’ve found a home for their music on Ninja Tune, the prestigious and long-running London powerhouse. They’re now a fixture on the international club and festival circuit; Mixmag listed them as one of the 25 DJs who defined 2023. All the while, Jordan has kept their personal story front and center, chronicling their gender transition on social media and offering a real, humble, and empowering presence to their fans. Sometime in the midst of this meteoric rise, Jordan’s music lost some of its magic. Early EPs like DNT STP MY LV, For You, and Watch Out! are beautiful, ecstatic, and overflowing with feeling in a way that makes you want to do more than dance—cry, maybe, or stage dive. But since around the time of their 2022 collab with Fred Again.., their tunes have felt glossy and flat, drained of intensity. I AM JORDAN, their debut full-length, is, in concept, a bravely personal record, celebrating Jordan’s self-realization, queer community, and working-class roots. Musically, though, it is strangely hollow, full of tracks that are technically well-executed but emotionally unmoving. In spite of its high tempos, rave clichés (police sirens, canned spinbacks, a Shephard tone), and rowdy hints of donk and hard house, it only occasionally achieves liftoff. The album’s best track is “People Want Nice Things,” an ethereal banger that chronicles Jordan’s transition in a clever and subtle way: To track how their voice dropped when they started taking T, they recorded themself saying the title phrase once every month for 10 months, then used those recordings as the song’s central vocal sample. But the rest of the album feels less distinctive and artistically assured than Jordan’s early records. The first single, “Real Hot n Naughty,” is a collaboration with the actor and dancer Felix Mufti. Jordan says they aimed to create “a real queer northern dance anthem” with this one, which feels like a big promise for a bit of shiny organ house with jokey Scouse raps on top. Other tracks feel more like genre templates than works of impassioned creativity. Take “Round n Round,” an effective speed-garage ripper, but one devoid of any twists or flourishes to make it exciting, surprising, or uniquely Jordan’s. This one debuted on Jordan’s socials in a tutorial titled “How to finesse your wobs in Ableton.” Heard in that context, you might have assumed it was a bare-bones demo made expressly for that purpose. It’s telling that the wob tutorial is more memorable than the song in it. You wonder how I Am Jordan would hit without any supporting content—that is, no prior knowledge of Jordan’s personal story, no socials packed with professionally edited videos and pictures. It’s admirable when music explores delicate aspects of the human experience, especially in the often wordless and utilitarian world of club music. Ideally, though, the music itself would do that, without too much help from outside. Jordan has our attention because they are an artist with something valuable to say, musically and personally—but you might not know that from I Am Jordan.

Rema,HEIS,7.8,Pop/R&B,"At the O2 Arena in London last November, Nigerian Afrobeats star Rema came onstage riding a glowing red-and-black horse and wearing a mask inspired by Queen Idia, a cultural icon dating to the 16th-century Kingdom of Benin. The musician hoped it would be a devastating statement on the UK’s continued hoarding of African art, including famous sculptures of Idia. Elsewhere in the show, he performed atop a giant bat, referencing a familiar sight in the skies over Benin City. But the theatrical tribute to Rema’s hometown and his people’s history was met with reactions ranging from confusion to conspiracy theories questioning whether he was part of the Illuminati. The colossal international success of Rema’s 2022 single “Calm Down” accelerated the rise of a feather-ruffling new voice in Afrobeats, one keenly aware of his potential to ascend to the level of the genre’s big three—Burna Boy, Davido, and Wizkid. That fateful show in London spurred the creation of Rema’s second album, HEIS, a record that kicks back with spring-loaded rhythms and gleeful provocations and brings the defining elements of his city front and center. Up until now, Rema was often spotted with a cuddly human-size teddy bear. On HEIS, the 24-year-old artist adopts a roguish anti-hero character, represented by a bat, who flexes with the grandiosity of a U.S. rapper: Rema as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Alexander Wang, icy wrists, and Richard Mille all wrap around the beat of the wordy yet contagious “Yayo”; on the chorus of “Hehehe,” he unleashes a cartoonishly sardonic laugh. He’s in Venice sipping Henny on the Miami bass-inspired “Azaman,” which sounds like he’s winking at you from what could be the top deck of a yacht. Rema hadn’t touched base in Benin City since 2018, having moved to Lagos before launching his career with breakout first single “Dumebi.” HEIS reconnects with his home city’s energy: Percussion moves in unbreakable clusters, dusty guitars are swapped for laser-gun synth, and strings outline the album in an ornate gold frame. “Black Bentayga, smoking a reefer,” Rema begins the title track, with Arabic strings rising around him as though Amaarae’s Fountain Baby is filling the Bentley’s speakers. At just 28 minutes, HEIS moves with ceaseless hustle. Where Rave & Roses opened with a cauldron of sentimental chords and guitar, HEIS begins with four blunt bars of 16-bit synth stabs before springing into uninterrupted action. “Follow me run, you tear your ACL,” he raps on “Azaman.” Far from the chiseled stylings of Asake and Wizkid, Rema opts for an antsy stream of consciousness with the momentum of a Ferrari. Just as the pace threatens to slow, “Ozeba” stages a blind date between snapping kuduro and the sort of deep-voiced vocal inflection Playboi Carti has toyed with recently. The chemistry is immediate. The final moments of HEIS tease a full-on heel turn. The penultimate “Villain” samples the featherweight piano of Lana Del Rey’s “A&W”—itself a song that cycles through characters and states of moral alignment—and turns it into a sinful amapiano body-winder. “Please don’t be mad at the fact that your baby na my baby don’t take it personally,” Rema sings through a Cheshire cat grin. “Now I Know” snaps out of this fantasy to touch on raw wounds. “All of my childhood I lost ’cause I wan feed family,” he cries, thinking of the struggle of caring for his loved ones after the death of his older brother at 15. It’s a moment of revelation from an album of blood-pumping madness. In going back home, Rema recasts an act of defiance as a thrilling character arc and a snapshot of his home city. It’s as exhilarating as a street race, as gothic as the bats flying above him.",0,"July 17, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rema-heis/
Mabe Fratti,Sentir que no sabes,8.4,Experimental,"Mabe Fratti says her music is like looking at yourself in a “really good mirror” and staring at “all the pores in your skin.” Her charmingly idiosyncratic songs seem to caress every small hollow, every laugh line, every curiously located freckle. The Guatemalan-born, Mexico City-based artist thrives on that kind of in-your-face freedom: She twists horns, drums, and cello into angular shapes, shifting between the structures and textures of experimental music, post-rock, jazz, and classical. Sentir que no sabes (Feel Like You Don’t Know), her third album in eight months, is a statement of self-definition—one that encourages you to be at peace with all your insecurities. It’s this propensity to let the irregular feel like second nature that makes Fratti so magnetic. Sentir que no sabes is a summons to make your own rawness a home. On Sentir, Fratti moves closer to the silhouettes of pop and rock than ever before. These songs start to follow more discernible and familiar forms—although she continues to luxuriate in the oblique. “Oídos” begins with jagged, unsettling strings, plinking piano notes landing alongside Fratti’s plangent vocals. A lonely trumpet, played by Jacob Wick and arranged—along with all the album’s drums and strings—by Fratti’s Titanic collaborator Héctor Tosta, blares in the background, twisting into serpentine tendrils. It’s too meandering to be a proper pop song, but still cohesive enough to soundtrack a pensive montage in an art-house film. Lead single “Kravitz,” on the other hand, is full-blown rock, with a grungy bassline and thumping kick drum chugging alongside Fratti’s paranoid lyrics about ears in the ceiling. There are still a couple of jolts, of course: a shrill key; a portentous horn; a trembling vocal performance. Fratti has a gift for creating small dramas like this. She possesses the self-assurance of a viper, slithering through dissonance and harmony without hesitation. This capacious mode looks good on her. On previous releases, it was easy to let Fratti’s words fade into the background—to be moved by a discordant blast of percussion, a spectral melody, or a strummed cello phrase. Fratti has always examined psychic interiors in her lyrics, but Sentir offers more urgent ruminations on the struggle to process emotions, make decisions, and not know what’s next. This often takes the form of self-interrogation. Under a plaintive plucked cello and ethereal, ’80s-inspired keys on “Pantalla azul,” she wonders, “No hay lección más que entender que todo se desordenó/¿Estoy en la razón?/¿Mientras los demás tienen otra historia?/¿Qué hacer con estos pedazos?/Seguir en la espera de un milagro.” Everything is a mess, but maybe it’s alright to feel lost in the pieces that are left behind, waiting for a miracle. In these moments, I feel a kinship between her lyrics and the digressive novels of Clarice Lispector. Like the Brazilian author, Fratti’s writing is sometimes inscrutable, but always self-scrutinous. It plunges into the confounding chaos of the psyche, seeking flashes of wisdom in all the muddle. Fratti moves gracefully between apprehension and acceptance as she delivers these reflections. Moments of unknowing hold their own among moments of clarity. “Márgen del índice” begins with harsh clanking, electronics hissing in the background like heavy machinery as Fratti chants in sinister tones. But 15 seconds in, a gorgeous melody takes hold—it’s as if Fratti is holding our hands through her own uncertainty, her mind moving from confusion to relief and back again. The instrumental tracks “Elástica II” and “Elástica I” have a similar effect; Fratti echoes the plasticity referenced in the title, treating her cello like the stretchy slime you might find in an ASMR video. It’s a masterful interpretation of the mass of entangled—and often conflicting—feelings that live in our consciousness. Sentir que no sabes is the kind of record that requires you to surrender to it, to listen meticulously and without expectation, regardless of how well you understand its themes. Fratti is much like Arthur Russell in that way—an artist who coaxes you to crawl into their alien world and make it your shelter. On the vocoder-laden “Alarmas olvidadas,” Fratti sings alongside a looping, growling cello. Everything is slow, loose, and lurching, like a strongman struggling to pull a big rig. Mint Field’s Estrella del Sol whistles in the background, but suddenly, there’s a brief respite from the tension: Arpeggiated keys and Fratti’s seraphic voice swell, rising above the unease. “La verdad es desafío,” she sings. Truth is a challenge. The unknown, she suggests, might not be something to avoid, but rather a place to immerse yourself. It might contain all the answers you need.",1,"June 27, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mabe-fratti-sentir-que-no-sabes/
Beabadoobee,This Is How Tomorrow Moves,7.4,Pop/R&B,"Shuffling through Beabadoobee’s discography is like taking a waterslide tour of ’00s radio. Beatrice Kristi’s 2020 debut Fake It Flowers showcased windy, Alanis Morissette abandon, while 2022’s Beatopia twirled deeper into Hilary Duff territory with its Disneyland sparkle and talk of Tinkerbell. Kristi’s newly released third album, This Is How Tomorrow Moves, continues the trend in prime Suzanne Vega coffee shop style. This album—the first Beabadoobee album to be co-produced by pop music mystic Rick Rubin—is a more subdued, acoustic version of her eager sleepover soundtracks. That’s to its credit: This Is How Tomorrow Moves’ folk-pop experiments tend to be more impressive than its sweetness. Call it growing up. While Beatopia conceptualized a fantasy world that Kristi created as a child, Kristi said in press materials that This Is How Tomorrow Moves is about womanhood, “I guess.” A lot has changed since she first started releasing music in 2017, at age 17. Now, at 24, she’s tried shrooms and gone on tour with Taylor Swift; most people will only ever accomplish half as much. So, with her third eye widened and career thriving, Kristi uses This Is How Tomorrow Moves to demonstrate that one compelling thing you can do with excess is eliminate it. The album’s minimalist moments are its strongest. “California” and “Post” introduce clanging drum loops, recalling the sparse, twisted roots of a Tori Amos song like “Space Dog.” “Everything I Want,” a whispery lullaby about a crush, has a sly, Lisa Loeb lilt to its restrained guitar, distilling an all-purpose romance into something more potent. These quiet seconds of introspection add hand-puppet drama to This Is How Tomorrow Moves: darkness and a little friction. Kristi sounds like she’s moved past the soft suction-cup kissing of a Rachael Leigh Cook movie and unwrapped the gift of hindsight. But This Is How Tomorrow Moves sometimes douses its introspection in unnecessary syrup. Kristi and her Beatopia collaborator (here, Rubin’s co-producer) Jacob Bugden have defanged bad feelings this way on past albums. Worried about your waistline, like Kristi sings on “Girl Song”? Beabadoobee pairs this anxiety with an overly sentimental piano. Noticing a tendency to infantilize yourself, as Kristi does on “Tie My Shoes”? Well, why not add a few cheerful horns. These flower-in-your-hair flourishes are reminiscent of the tail-wagging love songs that first made Beabadoobee famous on YouTube years ago, but amid the confident calm of the rest of This Is How Tomorrow Moves, they feel regressive, as safe as a pacifier. Usually, Kristi spits it out. On “This Is How It Went”—which meanders so pleasantly, it could convince you to stay awake a little longer—she proudly defends her diaristic songwriting process. This twinkly waltz isn’t free from oversimplification (she shouts out Elliott Smith for writing songs “about situations”). But its narrative is also emblematic of the defiant confidence that makes much of This Is How Tomorrow Moves an accurate portrait of early adulthood. In the space between self-awareness and pride, there’s room to grow.",0,"August 12, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/reviews/albums/beabadoobee-this-is-how-tomorrow-moves/
Kevin Richard Martin,Disconnect,7.3,Experimental / Electronic,"Disconnect opens like a pit slowly forming in your stomach. A featureless, windswept expanse emerges from the silence, and distant booms ring out on the horizon. The first sign of life is far from reassuring: a chorus of sighs and exhalations, the universal sound of hopelessness. “Differences” and the subsequent “Arkives” never really pick up momentum, only accumulating more shades of gray as they sprawl onward across double-digit runtimes. These two tracks comprise half of Disconnect on their own, and Kevin Richard Martin and KMRU spend the remainder of the album stripping them down and peeling back the layers in classic dub fashion—until they resemble errant puffs of smoke escaping from a Rhythm & Sound track. Anyone familiar with the works of the two artists shouldn’t be surprised by how grim their debut collaboration sounds. Martin is best-known for the mind-melting dubstep he makes as the Bug, but he’s recorded much of his best work over the last decade in a more ambient register, including his nerve-wracking solo album Sirens and the great Concrete Desert with drone legends Earth. KMRU, born Joseph Kamaru, broke out with 2020’s Peel on the late Peter Rehberg’s Editions Mego label, and has since amassed an eclectic if generally monochromatic catalog. These are musicians who thrive in blasted, apocalyptic sound worlds; Disconnect is a natural extension of both of their repertoires. What’s a surprise on Disconnect is the inclusion of Kamaru’s vocals. His spoken-word passages expand on a theme he previously explored on his 2022 album Temporary Stored: the theft of African artifacts by Western museums and archives. “African traditions are passed across through apprenticeship and other oral traditions,” the Kenyan-born artist explains on “Arkives,” as opposed to the Western emphasis on written documents deemed “ontologically concrete.” On both albums, Kamaru argues that the keeping of African artifacts in Western museums distorts their meaning and purpose, as many of these items are “more than just objects” in their own cultures. Martin first discovered Kamaru through a documentary and was attracted to his musical sensibilities as well as the quality of his voice. Across the four versions of “Differences” and “Arkives” that constitute the album’s second half, Martin chops Kamaru’s voice into tiny fragments, emphasizing the “ark” part of “archives”: It’s an appropriate choice for a record that sounds like the first showers of a cataclysmic flood. At first, it might escape a casual listener’s notice that these are six variations on two songs, not because the versions are radically different from each other, but because the sound palette is so consistent and so subdued that it all eventually blurs into an amorphous miasma. What’s curious is that Kamaru’s vocals on “Arkives” are smeared in megaphone filters and delay effects that occasionally make them hard to understand. That initially seems like a strange decision for an album that’s consciously trying to make a point about colonial violence, but by presenting Disconnect’s two core tracks as mutable materials rather than as treatises written in stone, the two artists honor the malleability of tradition through the very medium they work in. Dub treats songs as living, breathing, changeable entities. Disconnect gets its message across through Kamaru’s words and through the music itself, whose darkness feels less oppressive thanks to the creators who speak life into it.

Kamasi Washington,Fearless Movement,6.9,Jazz,"Kamasi Washington likes to go big. The star saxophonist and bandleader’s debut album was a 3xLP extravaganza appositely titled The Epic. The follow-up, Heaven and Earth, was a bit briefer—only two hours this time—but even more ambitious. Fearless Movement, the third full-length with his name on the spine, shows signs of scaling back and relaxing. Its runtime is a comparatively lean 86 minutes. The third track is a Zapp cover; George Clinton shows up a couple tunes later on a funk jam called “Get Lit.” There are guest verses from a few different rappers, little-known names who bring throwback block-party MC energy even when their subject matter gets heady. For the first time, Washington seems interested in conveying not just big feelings like joy, struggle, and transcendence, but also something like fun—just as important, no doubt, and perhaps even more difficult to get across. Washington became jazz’s most recognizable new face in part through his conviction that jazz writ large is a pressing contemporary concern. Though he has collaborated with high-profile musicians from outside of jazz—Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly the greatest among them—his own music communicates a populist spirit not through concessions to mainstream styles, but grand scale and sheer musical urgency. With their large ensembles, thunderous climaxes, and marathon runtimes, his records present jazz as vitally important, worth paying attention to even if you’re not a connoisseur. This heavy import can suffocate playful invention and human idiosyncrasy, two forces as central to jazz as the composerly ambition and spiritual yearning that characterize much of Washington’s work. In theory, the relative lightness of Fearless Movement is a natural and welcome next step after his pair of zeitgeist-grabbing epics. But too often, tunes that might prance, flex, and delight remain burdened by their own gravity. Fearless Movement’s first half is filled with guest vocalists delivering songs that attempt awkwardly to be soundtracks for both revelry and deep contemplation. The album gets better when it dispenses with its noncommittal relationship to party music, freeing Washington to pursue the heroic high drama that’s still his strong suit. The players, all excellent musicians, are drawn largely from the same crew of friends that powered Washington’s earlier work. Their default mode is full-tilt shredding, which can be thrilling and stultifying. Accompanists tend to nip at the heels of soloists rather than hang back and let them cook, an approach that pushes both sides to greater excitement when it’s working well: When Brandon Coleman’s organ dogs Dontae Winslow’s trumpet on “The Garden Path,” Winslow bobs and weaves as if to evade its pursuit, and Coleman responds by digging in even more ferociously. But when they’re all going so hard all the time, it leaves little room for the surprise of an individual outburst or the sensuality of negative space. There are two drummers playing full kits, and several additional percussionists; when one starts to settle into a pocket that might get bodies moving, the other tends to take it as a cue to start up with busy fills. Zapp’s “Computer Love,” in its original 1986 version, presented prescient social commentary with campy good humor and an irresistible groove. Washington’s cover takes out the dance beat, doubles the runtime, and adds a solemn horn intro, as if listeners need these signifiers of seriousness to understand that there’s a message about digitally mediated relationships entwined with Zapp’s pop appeal. “Get Lit” is more squarely aimed at setting off the good times, and it nearly succeeds with its swampy rhythm section and dose of freakiness from Clinton on the hook. But when rapper D Smoke, winner of the Netflix hip-hop competition show Rhythm + Flow, shows up to do a frothy Anderson .Paak impression on the verses, it gives that feeling of mandatory celebration you sometimes encounter at office parties. It’s hard to have fun when the host seems so thirsty to entertain. The other guest rappers are Ras and Taj Austin, sons of West Coast lifer Ras Kass, who deliver Freestyle Fellowship-style conscious rhymes over the band’s electric churn on “Asha the First.” Given Washington’s contributions to one of the greatest jazz-rap fusion records ever made, it’s disappointing that he seems content to drop a couple of verses into the middle of a jam, without much consideration for how the pieces fit together. A jazz solo and a rap verse have a lot in common: Good ones balance individual flair with consideration for the context of the larger song. The Austin brothers come across as technically skilled but lacking the thematic grasp that might help them to convincingly inhabit the music around them. Like D Smoke, their appearances can’t help but feel like incursions, breaking the sense of a holistically unified musical world that Washington so deftly created on his previous albums. Fearless Movement is much stronger in its second half, starting with “Dream State,” an exercise in hypnotic minimalism featuring André 3000 on flutes. He and Washington have an easy chemistry, with the sax’s long expressive phrases meandering pleasantly around the flute’s looped arpeggios. Perhaps the coolness of their playing inspired the rhythm section to chill out a little: Halfway through “Dream State,” they finally enter with the album’s slinkiest and sexiest groove, its laid-back swagger contrasting nicely with the meditative stillness of the winds. “The Garden Path” has the album’s most exuberant melody, one that immediately felt familiar and right the first time I heard it. The band goes full tilt without getting in each other’s way, just rocketing together in the same direction. When they return to the theme after a searing solo, there’s an air of real triumph, like returning home from a great trial. This is the sort of stuff Washington does best. Though it may seem more serious or less accessible on its surface than a track like “Get Lit,” it’s actually far more inviting: Washington seems to believe completely in what he’s doing, where his attempt at a dancefloor banger rings hollow. That sense of conviction, coupled with Washington’s ability to deliver on his vision, reinforces the invitation to commune with the music. You don’t want to hear someone half-step; you want to hear them commit. Another reason Washington has resonated with listeners outside of traditional jazz channels may be the way he elevates the album itself—the sum of its arrangements, production, sequencing, and so on—to a position of aesthetic significance equal to or greater than the improvising that those traditional channels tend to value. (He’s not the first jazz player to give his music this sort of presentation, which can also help to account for why Bitches Brew, for instance, is so much more popular among rock fans than Workin’ with the Miles Davis Quintet.) It may seem strange to barely mention the actual playing here, but Washington’s music is like that: For better or worse, his albums sweep you up with a force that can seem bigger than any individual soloist, bandleader included. As with his career at large, Washington’s strongest moments as a saxophonist tend to involve emphasis rather than invention. He’s a skilled technician; when he plays fast lines, he can come dangerously close to sounding like he’s still in the practice room, running arpeggios and scales. But he’s a master of what’s sometimes called “the cry of jazz”: the pained, ecstatic expression that emerges from an instrument or voice at a climactic moment and seems to transcend theory and technique in favor of pure emotion. It’s there in his solo on the album-opening “Lesanu,” and again on the album-closing “Prologue.” In the latter, the band steadily ascends through a series of long-held chords, growing more frenzied as they climb, each one seeming like the last, then yielding to a new plane of even greater intensity. Washington climbs with them, wailing and growling. Eventually, he lands on a single repeated note, playing it again and again with furious and desperate resolve, as if something precious and unnamable is on the line. It’s clear that those high stakes are real in his music. In these moments of Washington’s greatest power as a player—which, it must be said, arrive a little less often than usual on Fearless Movement—it’s easy for a listener to believe, too.

Ween,Chocolate and Cheese,9.0,Rock,"Before TikTok, before Guitar Hero placements, before iPod ads, and before The O.C., the hopes and dreams of fledgling alt-rock acts lay in the hands of two teenage chuckleheads in Highland, Texas. Debuting in 1993, Beavis and Butt-Head was nominally a crude animated comedy about a pair of horny, headbanging ne’er-do-wells. But in those segments when its titular characters channel-surfed through the station’s latest Buzz Bin offerings, it became America’s most influential outpost of armchair music criticism, capable of turbocharging a band’s Soundscan numbers with a simple “this rules.” And as MTV’s highest-rated show in the mid-’90s, Beavis and Butt-Head also had enough clout to thrust strange, obscure groups into the national spotlight even when they thought they sucked. “What the hell is this crap?” Butt-Head exclaimed when confronted with Ween’s 1992 single “Push Th’ Little Daisies.” Even in the midst of a ’90s alt-rock boom that encouraged the masses to turn and face the strange, the song was odd, sounding like a nursery rhyme performed by a Casiotone-toting hotel-lounge act fronted by a six-year-old. But perhaps Beavis and Butt-Head’s allergic reaction to the song had as much to do with the fact that, in Ween, they saw an older, funhouse-mirror version of themselves. “Push Th’ Little Daisies” wasn’t just an annoying earworm, but a cautionary tale of what happens when two music- and sex-obsessed young men spend a little too much time on the couch doing mushrooms, cracking themselves up with dirty jokes in their own made-up vernacular. As big fans of Beavis and Butt-Head, Ween’s Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo (a.k.a. Gene Ween and Dean Ween) took the critique in stride—after all, “What the hell is this crap?” is a question these childhood friends were used to hearing ever since they forged their home-recording society in New Hope, Pennsylvania, circa 1984. It’s a question that no doubt consumed the unruly crowd at Trenton’s City Gardens in 1991, when the duo performed an infamous opening slot for Fugazi while high on ’shrooms as patrons flung chewing gum in their hair, and it’s likely what prompted a skinhead to punch Melchiondo in the face after a show in Minneapolis in ’89. In fact, “What the hell is this crap?” is precisely the reaction the duo sought to elicit with each and every song they produced, where they variously conjured ’60s-pop sweetness,’70s hard-rock hysterics, and ’80s-funk sleaze using the rudiments of hardcore, pawn-shop electro, and dollar-bin reggae. And as if their music wasn’t confounding enough, the duo also pledged allegiance to an imaginary demon god known as The Boognish, which was like their DIY-doodle version of Iron Maiden’s Eddie. Beyond the overwhelming stylistic sprawl of 1990’s GodWeenSatan and 1991’s The Pod, Ween were essentially analog-era harbingers of internet brain rot: just as today’s Gen Alpha kids perplex their parents with nonsensical blurtings of “Skibidi Toilet,” “Sigma,” and “Turkish Quandale Dingle,” Ween developed their own inside-joke glossary with recurring shout-outs to “the weasel,” “the Stallion,” and “Eddie Dingle,” creating a world where “brown” isn’t a mere color, but a state of mind. (When Fortnite gamer Tiko went viral in 2020 with his lo-fi irritant “Fishy on Me,” it basically sounded like a trap remix of a Pod outtake.) But early Ween records were funny because the music they were playing with was inherently funny—they weren’t so much crafting jokes as blowing up familiar cliches until they burst into a puddle of muck. Their formative ethos is best exemplified by the Pod standout “Captain Fantasy,” a burst of glam-metal histrionics and beatbox groove that’s the musical equivalent of a child preening in front of the mirror with a tennis-racket guitar while sporting his mom’s makeup and platform heels—ridiculous and charming in equal measure. But for all the seeming frivolity of the enterprise, Ween always had serious supporters in their corner: Their first couple of records were released by tastemaking indies TwinTone (former home to the Replacements) and Shimmy-Disc (run by underground figurehead Kramer), with production assistance from Rollins Band bassist Andrew Weiss (whose boss was prone to rapturously sermonizing about the duo’s life-changing powers). And in the post-Nevermind wilds of 1992, the music-industry landscape had been sufficiently upended for a band like Ween to find themselves on Elektra Records. More remarkably, they were allowed to issue a major-label debut, Pure Guava, that pretty much adhered to the same low-budget standards as their anarchic indie releases. Still, even with the Beavis boost, Pure Guava’s “Push Th’ Little Daisies” felt less like a springboard for future mainstream conquests than a freaky fluke hit poised to join “Punk Rock Girl,” “Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant With My Two-Headed Love Child,” and “Detachable Penis” in the canon of left-field novelty tunes. But with their next album, Ween would have the last laugh. Entering a proper studio for the first time with drummer Claude Coleman Jr. (formerly of TwinTone labelmates Skunk), Ween made the proverbial leap from public-access-show pranksters to ready-for-primetime entertainers. Chocolate and Cheese’s debrownified presentation revealed to the Boognish-agnostic what the true heads already knew: that when you scraped away the cruddy production and pitch-shifting chicanery that defined their previous records, Ween were undeniable pop songwriters. Though the duo were no strangers to strung-out ballads and dreamy reveries, the goofily titled yet sincerely sung “What Deaner Was Talkin’ About” boasts the most pristine, poignant chorus hook in the entire Ween canon, like a “Here Comes the Sun” for people too bummed to open their drapes. And while the duo had written a number of cheeky singalongs like “Roses Are Free” before, in this case, the dinky four-track sonics of old give way to a carnivalesque splendor that complements the mischievous glee in Freeman’s voice, yielding their most fully realized fusion of The White Album and The Black Album to date. But arguably, the greatest measure of Ween’s musical and emotional growth appears in the form of Chocolate and Cheese’s lone instrumental: Where “A Tear for Eddie” deploys the sort of chintzy proto-Demarco yacht-rock Muzak the duo previously would’ve used to soundtrack their taco orders, here it serves as the somber backdrop to Melchiondo’s fretboard-wrenching tribute to the late Funkadelic guitarist Eddie Hazel, who had passed away in 1992. That nod to Hazel reaffirmed what set Ween apart from their early-’90s lo-fi peers: They were the rare American college radio darlings to directly engage with Black music, by reinforcing the spiritual connections between glam rock and funk and psychedelia and electro (a flow chart that the likes of MGMT and Tame Impala still consult to this day). But if their early displays of Prince worship blurred the line between pastiche and parody, Chocolate and Cheese offered their most sincere simulacrums of funk and soul to date. “Freedom of ‘76” wasn’t some winking attempt at Al Green or Marvin Gaye cosplay; it’s a song that’s as smooth and supple as those legends’ greatest hits (albeit updated with Boyz II Men shout-outs and incorrect factoids about B-list ‘80s comedies). And though it may be hard to sing the “boogie-oogie-oogie” hook of “Voodoo Lady” with a straight face, any sense that Ween were kidding around was laid to waste by Melchiondo’s lobotomizing guitar solo, which suggests Southern rock by way of Sonic Youth. Chocolate and Cheese boasts 16 tracks, but by Ween’s previous CD-stuffing standards, it was a veritable masterclass in judicious editing. A 30th-anniversary reissue released in 2024 unearthed a near-album’s worth of outtakes, but they sound more like holdovers from Ween’s chaotic, weed-clouded past than part of Chocolate and Cheese’s high-definition vision. (That said, the final product still made room for “Candi,” which satisfies the legally mandated requirement for at least one sputtering, broken-drum-machine endurance test on every Ween record.) But even as it made a convincing case for Ween as underappreciated craftsmen, Chocolate and Cheese also doubled down on their reputation as alt-rock’s most flagrant provocateurs. The album belongs to a more innocent, pre-edgelord era in pop-cultural trolling, when being actively offensive was seen as a noble act of punching up against an uptight boomer establishment, whose Democratic and Republican constituents were finding common cause in blacklisting records. It was the era of peak Howard Stern, of Bill Hicks’ ascendency to alt-comedy sainthood, and Denis Leary playing the Stone Temple Pilots to Hicks’ Nirvana in his MTV-commercial rants. Heck, even a young Radiohead were naming albums after Jerky Boys skits. As a pair of suburban stoners way more interested in food than politics, Ween didn’t project the same sort of outwardly hostile energy as the aforementioned contrarian cranks. But their deceptively affable demeanor meant they could get away with pushing the envelope even further. While Freeman and Melchiondo would shudder at being labeled “comedy rock,” they approached music-making like a sketch troupe: Every song was its own self-contained absurdist environment, each presenting a new opportunity to reinvent themselves with different sounds, scenarios, and some possibly ill-advised but endearingly executed fake-accented roleplay (see: the mock-Mexican murder ballad “Buenas Tardes Amigos” or the mutant, Middle Eastern metal of “I Can’t Put My Finger On It,” possibly the first only and song ever inspired by the stench of falafel). And like great comic actors, Ween can convey an entire universe in simple ad-libbed details: On the opening honky-soul swinger “Take Me Away,” Freeman drops in an Elvisesque “thank you” to a smattering of canned applause, and you’re immediately thrust into a sparsely attended supper club somewhere in the Midwest circa 1974, watching some aging and bloated former pop idol desperately trying to stay hip 15 years past his prime; you can practically picture the sweaty overgrown sideburns, unbuttoned dress shirt and dangling bowtie. It’s no coincidence that some of Ween’s most vocal fans are sketch-comedy creators themselves—Mr. Show, Tim and Eric, the South Park guys, and Tenacious D included. (And at a time when the alt-rock world was still grieving the death of Kurt Cobain, Ween dedicated Chocolate and Cheese to the late SCTV great John Candy, who died a month before him.) But where their past albums were liable to degenerate into giggle fits, Chocolate and Cheese never breaks the fourth wall or winks for the camera. It effectively traps the listener in deeply uncomfortable situations where you’re forced to ask yourself: Should I be laughing at this? The centerpiece ballad, “Baby Bitch,” perfected the acidic Elliott Smith acoustic serenade before Smith had become synonymous with the form, but its wounded heart is wired to a gangsta rap brain. The song catalogs the unresolved resentments that bubble up when your ex resurfaces after you’ve entered a new relationship. But while countless dorm rooms across America have collectively burst into laughter at the sound of Freeman softly singing “fuck you, you stinkin’ ass ho” over dulcet guitar strums, the song is as unflattering a portrait of male insecurity and self-loathing as anything the Afghan Whigs were putting out at the time. And yet, the experience of stewing in the ugly emotions of “Baby Bitch” is a cakewalk compared to “Spinal Meningitis (Got Me Down),” which could very well be the only rock song ever written from the first-person perspective of a frightened young child about to undergo a painful spinal tap. You could be forgiven for initially thinking the song belongs to that mid-’90s moment in comedy where even terminally ill children were fair game. But the very aspect of the song that might elicit an instinctual snicker (i.e., Freeman’s infantilizing vocal filter) is also the thing that makes it so uniquely unsettling. When he starts to plead “Please don’t let me die,” the song becomes as vivid and grueling a depiction of child suffering as you’re liable to hear in a pop context, and you feel like the most horrible person in the world for ever thinking the song was meant to be funny. And yet, the experience of trying to stifle your chuckles amid the hospital-bed horrors of “Spinal Meningitis Got Me Down” is nothing compared to the moral crisis that awaits you on “The HIV Song.” It’s a two-minute track whose lyrics amount to two repeated words—and those words happen to be “AIDS” and “HIV.” And they’re set to a festive polka beat, effectively transforming the names of the most devastating and politically fraught infectious disease of the era into a cheery Oktoberfest chant. At a time when prestige AIDS-themed dramas like Philadelphia, And the Band Played On, and Angels in America were being feted on primetime award-show stages, “The HIV Song” was basically a loud fart let loose during a funeral elegy. But as inappropriate as that may seem, the song can also be seen as a natural nervous reaction to unspeakable tragedy. Sure, it’s safe to assume there’s no way Ween could get away with releasing “The HIV Song” today, but its deeply silly response to a deadly serious issue might actually make more sense in the wake of a COVID pandemic where we were repeatedly encouraged to laugh our way through the dark times. Ultimately, “The HIV Song” was the most extreme manifestation of Chocolate and Cheese’s proudly counterintuitive governing logic. As its title implies, the album was all about mashing things that don’t really belong together—juvenile behavior and lofty ambition, pretty melodies and profane lyrics, humor and horror—all wrapped up in an instantly iconic cover photo where horndog Penthouse Forum fantasy meets WWE pageantry. It was the Sgt. Pepper’s of bad taste, an exemplar of Ween’s eagerness to not just touch the third rail, but hug it like a teddy bear. And if, from a traditional chart-metric perspective, Chocolate and Cheese didn’t immediately turn Ween into the big-ticket rock gods that Rollins correctly predicted they would become back in 1990, it certainly marked the turning point where you could start to realistically entertain such notions. Eight months after Chocolate and Cheese’s release, Ween found themselves trapped in the middle of what was essentially a live-action version of Beavis and Butt-Head—i.e., sitting on a couch and watching videos on MTV’s dime. The duo was guest-hosting 120 Minutes, and while they didn’t go so far as to shit-talk any bands, they didn’t seem all that excited about the Soul Coughing and Letters to Cleo videos they were being teleprompted to introduce. Maybe they were just baked, but their blasé attitude was also indicative of a growing indifference toward the alternative rock culture with which they were associated. For Ween, to be truly alternative meant completely distancing themselves from anything that could be easily marketed as alternative. Within a few months, they would hitchhike further down the path opened by Chocolate and Cheese’s cowpoke reprieve “Drifter in the Dark” to cut a bona fide old-school country record with a team of Nashville session pros. A year after that, they made a nautically themed prog-pop concept album that would go on to spawn a nautically themed cartoon empire. By the end of the ‘90s, they were pretty much the only band that could be found on Phish’s setlists and in Limp Bizkit’s CD changer, while the prescient establishment of their Chocodog.net site hastened the expansion of their cult and deepened their mythology by offering up a proto-Bandcamp array of archival material. And even as Ween’s journey turned more turbulent and sporadic in the 21st century, a sizable army of tribute bands rose up to spread the Boognish gospel in their absence. It’s hard to imagine any of that happening without Chocolate and Cheese, the moment when this home-recording project based around a made-up demon deity started to become a genuine religion unto itself. Coming into the record, Ween were in danger of being the next King Missile; coming out, they were the new Grateful Dead. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Daydream Plus,,6.8,Rock,"The shredders of Tomb Mold seem intent on being anything but straight-ahead death-metal musicians. Since establishing their main outfit as one of the beastliest OSDM groups in recent memory, each member has stretched their tentacles further outward. In Dream Unending, guitarist Derrick Vella has embraced heavenly post-rock guitar tones and slowed his riffs to a luminescent crawl, while Tomb Mold’s latest album, The Enduring Spirit, is less a sludgy beatdown than a skyward journey into chorus-pedal-fueled prog. Payson Power and Max Klebanoff, now two EPs into their Daydream Plus side project, have ditched the distortion and devil horns altogether for a breezy fusion of smooth jazz and math rock. If Tomb Mold have been unfairly maligned for dressing like nerds, Daydream Plus practically dare the haters to come after their lunch money. With artwork straight out of an old city-pop record and riffs so smooth you can practically hear the laughter erupting between takes, the whole project feels like an inside joke being wheeled out to the public just to see if it has legs. If the duo’s crisp 2022 EP set the tone, their follow-up, Escape at Your Own Pace, pushes their sound further, adding a new bassist and guitarist to the mix and bringing in the slightest of metal touchstones to create a silly yet satisfyingly light experiment. Once again clocking in under 15 minutes, Escape at Your Own Pace briskly powers through its four short songs, reveling in its low-key vibe. Though the artwork may call back to jazz-fusion albums from the likes of Masayoshi Takanaka and Casiopea, the closer Japanese comparison would be the clean guitar tones of bands like toe and tricot, with Payson fluttering his way through one sweetly melancholic riff after another. “Gently Technical” opens the EP on a surfer’s high, its winsome melody building to a finale laden with show-offy finger taps and cheeky, wind-swept chimes. “Neighborhood Watch” makes the metal connection even more apparent, opening on a blast-beat run from Klebanoff before settling into its sunny groove, with Power firing off the occasional screeching pinch harmonic for good measure. The flourishes are integrated so subtly that if you didn’t know these guys were metalheads in their day jobs, you might miss it entirely. The EP’s remaining half goes down just as easy, even if the tracks are mellow to a fault. “Hourglass” phases through one anime-credits-ready riff after another without offering much in the way of a build, while “Try to Relax” takes its own advice a little too much to heart, cruising on a slow, dreamy riff that effectively puts the EP to bed. The project’s greatest achievement is in the way it continues to widen Tomb Mold’s musical universe. As each member has experimented with brighter tones, it feels like brutality is becoming less central to what this group is trying to achieve. Turns out that once you strip away the monstrous riffs, torrential drums, and imagery of unholy interstellar oblivion, Tomb Mold might actually just be beach-blanket music in disguise.

Blood Incantation,Absolute Elsewhere,8.5,Metal,"There’s a moment halfway through the making-of documentary for Blood Incantation’s new album that unlocks everything you need to know about the Denver death-metal band. Sitting in front of a whiteboard filled with diagrams mapping out every new-age synth solo, krautrock interlude, and blastbeat slam, lead singer Paul Riedl listens back to the studio recording. As his vocal part comes up, he shuts his eyes, holding his hands in chalice formation as he imitates his own inhumane screams. The moment it’s done, he giggles like an excited schoolboy. The rest of the band quietly nod one by one: “Sweet.” “Sick.” “Hell yeah.” Sixty years into the genre, the spirit of metal lives on. Though many a band have sought to elevate metal in their own way, there’s a winking absurdity to the way Blood Incantation approach the task. They want to be more than simply another OSDM band, to be sure, but while they aren’t afraid of the occasional ambient zone-out, the quartet takes metal higher by leaning deeper into the genre’s essential nerdiness, rather than trying to escape it. Hidden History of the Human Race, with its psychedelic aura of alien conspiracies and dedication to shredding with third eye open, captured the zonked-out magic of alternating dorm-room bong hits with drooling over the gory details of your roommate’s Cannibal Corpse posters. While their spiritual siblings in Tomb Mold hinted at a proggier turn on last year’s The Enduring Spirit, on Absolute Elsewhere, Blood Incantation take that mission to heart by going straight to the source. Where Tomb Mold found a path to the heavens in the ’80s guitar tones of the Blue Nile and the Durutti Column, Blood Incantation use the ’70s as a launchpad to plunge into the starless prog-rock abyss, balancing the pastoral splendor of Yes and Popol Vuh with the profane madness of Gorguts and Demilich. Absolute Elsewhere is drenched in a murky incense stench; recorded in Berlin’s famed Hansa Studios, where Brian Eno’s graffiti from his sessions with Bowie still decorates the walls, and half the equipment comes marked with stickers to denote which pieces are Tangerine Dream originals, Blood Incantation give themselves free rein to follow their geekiest impulses all the way to Valhalla. The result is their most adventurous music yet, an ode to the time-honored lava-lamp sesh that pays tribute to their forebears while staking a claim to the band’s own shadowy corner of the universe. Stretching their sci-fi sagas across two sprawling 20-minute tracks—each one helpfully subdivided into three smaller “Tablets” for ease of navigation—Blood Incantation reach their heaviest heights yet by showing just how soft they can go. If sameness is death metal’s Achilles heel, they counter by filling even their songs’ subsections with so many passages and transitions that each one practically has an album’s worth of ideas. Within two minutes of Absolute Elsewhere’s opening assault, the group drops everything to trudge through a galactic swamp of dubbed-out drums and bubbling, Cluster-like arpeggios. When a squiggling neon synth solo finally pierces the fog, you’d think you were at a Pink Floyd laser light show where the technician kept switching the speaker system over to a Morbid Angel CD. Prog metal has often been defined by its dedication to virtuosity, but Blood Incantation’s strain is more concerned with pure zoneage. There are flairs of Opeth’s clean acoustic balladry, Dream Theater’s surreal symphonics, and Atheist’s spidery fretwork, but Blood Incantation’s obsession with everything hypnotic and kosmische informs even their heaviest riffs. In the back half of “The Message [Tablet I],” they slow their charge to a lurch, casting off phantasmal pinch harmonics that loop upward like distress signals transmitting through the dark. On “The Stargate [Tablet II],” after soaring through a dense cloud of synths (from Tangerine Dream’s own Thorsten Quaeschning) and a glistening acoustic jam dappled with fluttering Mellotron, the band suddenly unleashes a pummeling one-chord stomp. Isaac Faulk’s apocalyptic drums ratchet up the intensity one notch at a time, while Riedl and Morris Kolontyrsky wrench dissonant high notes out of their guitars as if they were trying to steer a comet. It’s a total curtain pull, the group’s prog paradise shattered to reveal some unholy cosmic truth underneath. That theatricality shows just how confident Blood Incantation have become. Countless moments throughout Absolute Elsewhere feel genuinely playful: the cheesy drum fill that kicks off the finale of “The Message [Tablet III]”; Riedl interrupting the inspirational opening gallop of “The Message [Tablet I]” to shout “WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN?” in his wizardlike snarl; the gradual acceleration toward the end of “The Message [Tablet II]” that swells like every Floyd album being played at once. There are multiple instances where the band stops on a dime only to come roaring back a second later, as if the hyperspeed finally kicked into gear. It’s sick every time. The group treats its riffs as if they actually have a reason to be there, so that each ritualistic return to headbanging feels both surprising and earned. In lesser hands, stringing together so many classic reference points could come off like regressive record-collector metal. Yet every passing homage to Camel and King Crimson manages to sound like the best moments from the Prog Archives stirred into an iridescent whirlpool, with the group’s tech-death binding it all together as if it were the ultimate endpoint for this kind of rock’n’roll escapism. Blood Incantation not only understand, but delight in what makes the best prog endure: lush textures, dizzying interplay, undeniable groove, a sense of worlds beyond. Toward the end of the album, the band digs into an unsuspectingly aching black-metal churn, the maelstrom building to supernova levels as Riedl’s screams stretch to an infinite howl. Just when it can’t seem to get any bigger, it all gets swept away, echoing out to some arcane, far-off land, where fantasy is alive and the riffs roam free.

Okay Kaya,Oh My God - That’s So Me,8.0,Pop/R&B,"If you thought Okay Kaya was taking liberties to question Dolly Parton on her last record, 2022’s SAP, then gird yourself for the targets on Kaya Wilkins’ fourth LP. “Picture This” begins by asking the listener to imagine themselves as “Sisyphus as a health-nut geologist” who is, once and for all, going to push that damn rock to the top. And the rock doesn’t like it one bit! “Who is this man with his clammy hands/And why is he defying/Gravity?” she sings from the once-victorious stone’s perspective. The 34-year-old Norwegian-American musician is here to rewrite the Greek myths, one nimble flip turning a 3000-year-old story into a neat wink about the fantasy of seizing control of one’s life; of conquering not just your health, but nature and fate. Better still, Wilkins doesn’t draw attention to how genuinely funny the lyrics are (“You want to be like your daddy/A rolling stone/Gain some speed and lose control,” she consoles the rock), instead all but smothering her run-on verses—sung in a head voice that suggests she’s low on oxygen—in languid, Moon Safari-worthy stardust. If Camus wrote that we must imagine the perpetually failing Sisyphus as happy, Wilkins’ unburdened hero has to be experiencing some degree of delusion. Smaller, similarly blinkered battles between man and nature play out across Oh My God - That’s So Me. The title phrase comes from the last song, the folky hymnal “The Art of Poetry,” in which someone looks at the moon and, “struck by familiarity,” utters it out loud. To fluttery woodwinds and loudening strings, Wilkins repeats the phrase over and over, seemingly captivated and a little horrified by the banality of seeing nature as nothing more than a mirror and a meme. Written and self-recorded on her new home on an island off Oslo only accessible by boat, Oh My God comes from a physical place of detachment, but puts a more organic spin on Wilkins’ usual lyrical Verfremdungseffekt. No longer does she leave lacerating lines suspended in mid-air, like a knife dangling off the edge of a table; her observations about contemporary states of distraction and detachment come wreathed in compassion and close focus. Without in any way lecturing about getting back to the land, there is the sense here that, somewhere along the line, humankind’s priorities have gone askew. No matter: They might yet be gently danced back onto the right track. In sublime standout “The Groke,” Wilkins coins her own myth of a stalking, wintry menace who’s either a sort of SAD selkie or the personification of the climate crisis—you decide—and writes her a theme tune: Miles-funky woodwind and woodblocks, strings with cartoonishly sharp verve, a chorus line intoning the hellhound’s name with a camp severity that implies you’d better watch your back. (While it doesn’t sound like U.S. Girls’ “4 American Dollars,” it nails the throwback brief just as expertly.) From the same school of finely turned disco wiggles as Arthur Russell’s poppiest moments, “Check Your Face” romances common sense—Wilkins urging it to “season me in reasoning,” and coming on so strong that there’s a good chance this would-be seducer doesn’t understand the equanimous object of her affections at all. It speaks subtly and incisively to how concepts like common sense, boundaries, and bandwidths have become buzzwords, but also sees the delusion of trying to conclusively attain them as endearing, as the coolest of basslines contrasts Wilkins’ exaggerated purr. The dreamier “Oh Minutiae” comes at the devotional affect from a different angle, a waltzing torch song played on what sounds like a cheap keyboard about the tiny rewards to be found in the world around you: the seaweed, “funny-looking oak leaves,” the “snowflakes and cornflakes” of a Norwegian winter. “They say the devil lies in the details,” Wilkins sings, coining another lovely, wonky aphorism: “I think that’s just a phrase … Not all good things are named after saints.” These funny, weird, tender songs are cast in a softer light than Wilkins’ previous albums, not least the unsettling SAP. Some may lament the lack of eeriness on Oh My God, but her adept songcraft, enveloping melodies, and mood-conjuring is sure-footed and enchanting—recalling Marry Me-era St. Vincent and the uncanniness of latter-day Cate Le Bon—and not short on off-kilter detail. Opener “The Wannabe” is straightforwardly rapturous, bluesy neo-soul that never lapses into pastiche because the sensuality Wilkins is craving is not rote carnality but that of basic human feeling: “I’m not a sculpture,” she sings. “I’ll take the frustrations/Just let me back into my body again.” “Help, I’ve Been Put Into Context!” laments the pinned-butterfly indignation of being incorrectly perceived with wry humor—“Stuck up on my hind legs/Speak in languages I never knew”—and tactile, rehumanizing beauty: chimes like tapped jars, snippets of soul drum fills, gently climbing acoustic chords. The fragility of all this is underpinned by the potential destruction lingering around the edges. “My Berenice,” a tale of obsession and breakup, is suspiciously pure and loving until the end flares with hysteria: “They say you dig your own grave,” sings Wilkins, building to a fit of pique, “but I dug hers too.” A cover of Shirley Collins’ 1960 song “Space Girl” (subtitled “(Shirley’s)”) is a prescient tale of a girl acting against her own interests, told through her mother’s warning against the dangerous lure of space technology; it winds up with Wilkins shrieking in a pained voice against sharp, bullheaded guitar. “And I Have a Blessed Life” is an insistent incantation of gratitude that clings on amid invocations of dread and seismic bass. “Life is Nietzsche on the beach/And then you die,” Wilkins sings in an ecstatic conclusion. The German philosopher once stated that how a man builds a sandcastle reveals his relationship to time: one panics; one refuses because of the inevitability of the coming waves; the wise man rolls up his sleeves and embraces the joy of building. The rock will always roll back down the mountain. But building as if the sand were stone—and laying some indelible bass lines in the process—are as good as a foundation gets.",0,"September 10, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/okay-kaya-oh-my-god-thats-so-me/
Navy Blue,Memoirs in Armour,7.8,Rap,"When Sage Elsesser first started anonymously self-releasing his music, listening to him felt like pressing an ear against a bedroom door, eavesdropping on a troubled man and his muffled prayers. Considering the community he’d sprouted from—fashionable Fairfax kids, skateboards in one hand and sponsorships in the other—his affect was markedly sober, a bare-bones hush that foregrounded little more than pen and paper, rhymes and loops. Since then, each of his albums as Navy Blue has been a study in self-interrogation, reckoning with the things closest to his conscience: family, spirituality, and the voices of his ancestors. All the while, his sound has been steadily evolving from the sparse, confessional-booth digs of his earliest days, branching out to accommodate his expanding worldview. Gradually, the microphone hum has faded, along with the scratchiness of the loops and the grainy languor of those grand piano swells: By last year’s Ways of Knowing, it didn’t sound like we were stealing secrets through a closed door anymore. Navy Blue was presenting a fully-produced snapshot of someone who had grown up. For all its existential baggage, this growth made Navy’s fourth LP feel like a cornerstone of his saga, a glimpse of how he could rap with more than just a distant snare in his headphones. Few moments passed where he was alone—there was constantly a fellow vocalist, a seductive melody, or an ornate live-band arrangement to keep him warm in the dusk of his turmoil. (“I can’t do this shit on my own,” he sang on “Freehold,” and it sounded like it.) Scaling back these accouterments makes Memoirs in Armour, his first release since being dropped by Def Jam, equally raw and rewarding. In a minimal record that elevates his voice, he ventures back into dusty early-career closets, commanding the no-frills confines he once found his footing in. Stripped-down as the music may be, his words carry more than enough weight to fill out the room. On Memoirs, he doesn’t seem nearly as interested in selling soundscapes as sitting us down and telling us difficult stories. Although Navy is rarely preachy, his raps can leave you wondering whether you’re going to hell. Part of this is the sheer mass, the brooding existential glare, of the matters he reckons with: the circularity of life, the looming specter of death, the cathartic gratitude that threads these things together. These are hefty subjects in their own right, though Navy’s message is fortified by his disposition, the steely cadence he’s long wielded to synthesize his heaviest burdens. Stern and unflappable, he spends Memoirs staring you in the eye, daring you to avert your gaze. Fittingly, there’s only one track here (“Running Sand”) that eases his onslaught with something close to a chorus; even then, he’s grim, as if reading his lyrics from a crystal ball: “Conceived, you born, you live, you die/My mama said don’t rush it, I can’t function with my pride.” He’s right—it isn’t pride that lines his voice, but reverent longing, stripping the walls of his past selves then studying the debris. Memoirs in Armour draws from a deep bullpen of guest producers, including the soulful Budgie (“Take Heed”), who worked extensively on Ways of Knowing, and Chuck Strangers (“Boulder”), who shares Navy’s meditative East Coast stomping grounds. For all the prowess they pack on their own, it’s compelling to see them take a backseat, parting the Red Sea for the rugged prophet at center stage. It’s even more compelling to watch Navy navigate the dry earth. “Time Slips,” a jarring eulogy of his sullen past, opens with quite the candidate for Introspective Hip-Hop’s pledge of allegiance: “This is the first time somebody would ever say this on a rap song, but can you turn me down?” Somber as he may sound, his vision is as clear as ever. “Depression was the birth of Navy Blue,” he raps. “My message is to serve a greater you.” He’s talking to us, but he could just as well be talking to himself. Correction: A previous version of this review stated that Navy Blue left Def Jam. It has been updated to reflect that he was dropped from Def Jam.",0,"August 2, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/navy-blue-memoirs-in-armour/
Half Waif,See You at the Maypole,7.4,Pop/R&B,"When Half Waif’s Nandi Rose began writing See You at the Maypole, she had just experienced a missed miscarriage and learned that her mother-in-law had pancreatic cancer. To process her grief, she started chasing the sunset. Driving down country roads on “Sunset Hunting,” a track on the new album, she is struck by the image of winter sunlight bouncing off barren land. Rose is no stranger to expressing inner turmoil: Albums like 2021’s Mythopoetics and 2020’s The Caretaker document the struggle to be known, the weight of her desire, the fear of abandonment that deep love instills in her. On See You at the Maypole, those sentiments send her searching for a way out. The album’s poignancy lies in her ability to hold both pain and beauty together at once, to allow the intensity of one to heighten the experience of the other. Rose’s sunset ritual underlines the solace that solitude offers. Throughout the album, her grief and indignation heighten when she has to articulate her loss to others. On the languid piano and violin ballad “The Museum,” she resents the positive outlook of a loved one who suggests that “we make our own future.” The synth and layered vocals on “Velvet Coil” settle like a sigh as Rose admits that she feels loneliest around someone who is “Holding a mirror/To the dark river that runs within me.” And on opener “Fog Winter Balsam Jade,” she generally feels abandoned and unprotected by the world: “And nobody made me promises/No one offered me protection.” Alternately alienated by her peers’ limited ability to save her yet also disturbed by the moments in which they see her too clearly, Rose turns to the comforts of nature. She finds inspiration in the understated resilience of a morning glory growing through a fence and admires the intuition of fish knowing which direction to swim. Nature also teaches her about impermanence: “The history of the river/Just give it time to pass/It was never ours” she sings on “Mother Tongue,” her voice piercing like a bell over a soft piano line. The river’s endless flow teaches her that loss is inevitable, but it also helps her cultivate hope: Sadness itself is a fleeting state, and after the winter, the spring will always follow. Fittingly, for an album that confronts the inadequacy of language when confronted with the complexities of grief, many of the most evocative passages are textural rather than lyrical. Rose often distorts her vocals or experiments with a choir, to captivating effect. The vocal modulations feel like an embodiment of her attempts to change, to reach for a new self, while laying bare all the ways she has been permanently reconfigured by her pain. “Violetlight,” in which she dreams of a peaceful future, is one of the loveliest moments on the record. Blips of synth shimmer over her reverberating vocals like sunlight traversing a lake’s surface. Conversely, on “I-90,” Rose reminisces on a forgotten love with building fervor and confusion. When the choir cuts in at the end, the brightness of their voices accentuates the vivid imagery of her storytelling to create an unsettling aura that haunts the air even after the recording ends. See You at the Maypole is an album of solitary mourning, but the music falls in a lineage of other songwriters who have grappled with the experience of losing a child. The way Rose thanks her child for making her a mother on “Fog Winter Balsam Jade” reminds me of Raveena’s stunning coming-of-age ballad “Time Flies,” in which she recounts a lost pregnancy and marvels, “I can’t believe I was a mother/Even if it was for a moment.” Motherhood is often positioned as a service to others: From childhood, women are conditioned to nurture those around them in preparation for becoming the primary caretakers of their children. But in both songs, the singers understand their experiences of motherhood as an internal and deeply personal shift, one that transcends the loss they experience. Rose’s nature imagery also reminds me of the way Joanna Newsom summons the cosmic energy of the stars and the anguish of dark water to mourn the infinite potential of a child who will never be born on “Baby Birch,” one of the greatest songs in her discography. Both writers tap something larger than themselves, accessing a heartbreaking sense of divinity to express their loss. Ultimately, the album functions as an offering, an effort to commune with the listener despite the limitations of language and the specificity of her pain.

d’Eon,Leviathan,6.9,Electronic,"Imagine this: you’re watching an actor in his mid-fifties playing a politician—a tall white guy with a good head of hair and a crisp blue suit, who greets his adoring public after a successful rally. Think a very special episode of Scandal. People cheer, they wave signs of support. Our great nation beholds its benevolent leader. And then, entering from the side of the screen comes a scary freak dressed in dark clothes. He has a gun! Pop, pop, pop. Screams, commotion. As the camera pans out to take in the bedlam, the music enters, just as you expect. An orchestral piece scaled down to computer size, its patriotic flattening uncanny. This is the music of a real crisis in a fake nation. Will our country survive? That is the question being urgently asked by d’Eon’s imagined score. On “The President Has Been Shot,” the song with the most appropriate title of all time, the oboes are distressed, the cellos are deeply upset, and the violins pump fast enough to match the speed of our racing hearts. Though Montreal producer Chris d’Eon always leaned toward a telegenic brand of miniaturized chamber music, at first it seemed like that predilection was an accent, not the focus itself. On 2011’s Darkbloom, a split LP with then-fellow underground Canadian producer Grimes, his sacramental trilling was blended with an instrument largely absent from his new music: drums. The use of percussion, largely owing to various forms of Chicago dance music, from house to footwork, was the least interesting part of the music, but the most prominent. Dropping the propulsion to focus on warped melodies has created a new lane, one in between the avant-garde and the heavenly, the classical and the canned. In the past decade, he’s released several volumes of fairly straight-ahead liturgical music via his Music for Keyboards series, though in the context of his much more fulsome new album Leviathan, those records seem more like a dare to see if he could do it, a mastering of mimicry along the way to truly finding his own goofier voice. Much of the music on his new album, like “The President Has Been Shot,” is dramatic, but, importantly, self-knowing. Yes, you can love a thing and make fun of it at the same time. This is music that sits somewhere between religious and hold music, where purgatory is both subject and experience. Two other tracks, in addition to “The President,” describe an action: “Climbing the Overhang” and “Installation of the Cisterns.” The former takes a playful approach with bloopy ’80s digi-funk synths, like climbing an overhang is an accomplishment that might have happened on The Jeffersons. The latter, with digital zither and bells giving the track a MIDI-gamelan feel, is ceremonial but a little sinister. These cisterns might end up as a part of a zany plot in Oceans 14. Elsewhere on Leviathan, d’Eon tackles, with less success, aughts-era radio R&B, the type of thing Polow Da Don or Jim Johnson trafficked in. It’s not that d’Eon doesn’t create a perfectly fine beat that Christina Milian would have gladly used, it’s that those songs, like “Heat Wave” and “Figurine”—which feels a little too indebted to the beat for TLC’s “No Scrubs” and Brandy and Monica’s “The Boy Is Mine”—don’t add much to a template that was well worn a decade ago. Leaving the immediate world of references, onscreen or otherwise, my favorite song on Leviathan is “Rhododendron pt. IV,” which shreds every one of d’Eon’s influences into a sunshiny tune. It’s a silly song, the bold and repeated organ giving way to the synthesizer woodwinds. It feels fun, curious, invigorating. It has echoes of early music’s pump-organ rigor, but it’s more whimsical than wallowing. It’s religious music if your pastor was the Rock. If d’Eon invites you to church some Sunday, you should probably go. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Myriam Gendron,Mayday,7.7,Folk/Country,"Myriam Gendron’s Mayday marks the obvious evolution of a songwriter who cut her teeth busking Leonard Cohen songs in the Paris Metro, whose 2021 release Ma délire - songs of love, lost and found reimagined traditional Quebec folk songs. These are direct, grounded dispatches from the collective unconscious, melodies for sweeping floors or felling trees or mourning that might have existed forever. Between her 2014 debut, Not So Deep as a Well, where Gendron put Dorothy Parker’s poetry to music, and the new record, the Montreal-based artist has sharpened her set of timeworn tools: voice and guitar strings, as fleet and restless as a sparrow in her hands. Gendron’s voice is earthy and unadorned, a Swiss Army knife that can cut stoic or wistful. One part Fairport Convention and one part Josephine Foster, her warble takes songs like “Look Down That Lonesome Road” and roots them even more deeply in folk tradition, yielding a sound that would be just as at home blaring from a gramophone as it would a forest clearing. Within one listen of a song like “Terres Brulées” (“Burnt Earth”), you can sing the melody back, as if retrieving it from a buried memory. Lyrically, these songs are soil-covered and windswept, sung alternately in English and French. “J’inventerai des aubes constellées d’hirondelles/J’écorcherai le froid tout gris qui nous appelle,” she sings (“I’ll invent dawns studded with swallows/I’ll scratch the cold gray that calls to us”). Later, on “Quand j’étais jeune et belle” (“When I was young and pretty”), she describes a lover soaked and chilled by the rain, who proposes they should marry under the branches of an oak. But the record’s brightest moments happen when the traditional brushes against the hyper-modern, like a match against kindling. The electrified strumming of closer “Berceuse” collides spectacularly with the free-jazz screech of Zoh Amba’s saxophone, and Marisa Anderson’s riffs on “Long Way Home” electrify Gendron’s tale of being tossed asunder, alone on the ocean. Jim White’s fevered drumming on album highlight “Lully Lullay” reads like a restless mind tethered to a sturdy pair of feet, the push-pull between Gendron’s slow, steady refrain and the frenzied cymbals driving a compelling tension. Mayday’s best songs are unsettled and kinetic, living organisms in a state of flux. With roots in the traditional—“Lully Lullay” was inspired by the Appalachian variant of the 16th-century English “Coventry Carol,” for example—these tracks walk the tightrope between the deeply familiar and the abstract, suggesting lullabies with serrated edges. For “Berceuse,” that’s more literal—in French, Gendron sings “Go to sleep, my daughter,” before the freaky saxophone tugs us towards the surreal. The track order dilutes some of this magic. Album opener “There Is No East or West,” a peripatetic acoustic melody, feels like a drawn-out preamble to the more compelling snap of “Long Way Home,” with its drums like a pulsing heart. Starting at such a low simmer before the second song’s cresting chorus—“Oh mother, other/Make my bed”—is a gamble, and it risks mislabeling an otherwise dynamic LP. Yet like a devastating Dorothy Parker couplet, a 500-year old carol, or the opening bars of “Suzanne,” there are moments on Mayday that feel essential, plucked out of the ether as if they’ve always existed. These chimeras of the past and present illustrate what Gendron does best—digging up timeless sounds only to disrupt them, reenvisioning what’s timeless for this precise moment.",0,"May 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/myriam-gendron-mayday/
Delicate Steve,Delicate Steve Sings,5.8,Pop/R&B,"Steve Marion’s songs have always been a little too interesting to dismiss as background music. Guided by the cheerful searchlight of his guitar, the vibrant, dependably eccentric instrumentals that Marion has released as Delicate Steve walk a fine line: Even at their most mellow, his songs court your full attention. On Delicate Steve Sings, though, Marion’s songs have finally faded into musical wallpaper. With its tongue-in-cheek title and smattering of cover songs, the record gestures at classic collections of reimagined standards like Chet Baker Sings or Willie Nelson’s Stardust (which Marion cites as an influence). But Delicate Steve Sings falls short of meeting the genre on its own terms, trying on the smooth lounge act trappings without really committing to the bit. What emerges is a clean but uninspired display case for his prodigious talents, a collection of—how else to put it?—easy listening instrumentals that more often than not feel bland. The covers, which comprise a third or so of the album, aren’t bona fide songbook standards but more recent tunes, like Otis Redding’s “These Arms of Mine” and Donnie and Joe Emerson’s “Baby.” Marion’s versions are tenderly executed, full of lyrical phrasings and quivering vibrato, though yawningly deferential on the whole—more Delicate Steve sings karaoke than Willie sings Irving Berlin. No matter how proficiently it’s performed, a straight-laced instrumental Beatles cover is going to sound like Muzak. Not even Marion’s crystalline touch can distinguish his rendition of “Yesterday” from the versions piping into hotel lobbies. The album’s originals aim for the same sepia-tinted austerity as the remakes, as if Marion wanted them to feel like lost R&B classics you can’t quite place. “Cherry” sounds like a repurposed Motown B-side that gropes at your heart without ever really touching it, part Marvin Gaye and part M*A*S*H theme song. “Medieval Eyes” fares slightly better, with twanging guitars that echo in and out of frame as Marion winds his way through a shuffling drum beat. But for the most part, Marion’s guitar traipses across terrain that’s simply too sparse, abandoning the smoky atmospherics and Afrobeat dreamscapes that have textured his previous work. Light flashes through the gray in the moments when Marion drops the tight-lipped lounge singer act and settles into his own creative voice, as on the album’s high point “I’ll Be There.” Backlit by loping bongos and steadily building strings, Marion activates the choice beach-bum riffing that has marked the best of his recent output. The drums ripple, the violins swell, and Marion’s guitar sings more forcefully than anywhere else on the album. Finally—a song better suited for car rides than elevator rides. It seems to belong to a different Delicate Steve record entirely. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Sour Widows,Revival of a Friend,7.6,Rock,"Catharsis does not always come quickly in a Sour Widows song, but when it does, it hits like a lightning strike. On early singles and EPs, musicians Maia Sinaiko and Susanna Thomson intermingled their voices and guitar melodies while dreamy soundscapes sprawled into extended vamps, holding tight to both tension and tenderness. The Bay Area band has honed its process on its debut full-length, Revival of a Friend—an album filled with patient, gracious songs that unfold with careful momentum and deep emotion. Revival of a Friend is shaped by grief: Both Sinaiko and Thomson faced significant loss in the years since starting the band, and those experiences are embedded in their songwriting. The dynamic “I-90” pays tribute to a partner Sinaiko lost to an accidental overdose, filtering sweet, quotidian memories through the retrospective lens of sorrow. “Initiation,” too, is a song of mourning, written after the 2021 death of Thomson’s mother; its imagery is striking, combining the sacred and visceral in lyrics that sing of “Heaven spilling at the steppe/Stardust in the cup of my hand.” Many of these songs depict a narrator reaching out for connection, grasping for something just beyond their grasp: “Fuck everything I did/To feel good for a moment,” goes the opening of “Cherish,” which eventually comes around to a pleading note: “Will you love me through this?” But beneath the desperation and severed connections lies the sound of musicians who are deeply attuned to each other. Sinaiko and Thomson are longtime friends who first met as teenagers and have written songs together ever since. You can hear their intimacy in the way they play and sing together—guitar melodies that snake and vine around each other; vocal harmonies where each voice complements the other with richness and depth. Drummer Max Edelman joined the band after Sinaiko and Thomson’s very first show as a duo, and his playing—along with bassist Timmy Stabler—ranges from delicate to thunderous, forming a deft backbone for the songs’ ebbs and flows. Several songs shift seamlessly into instrumental interludes—like the spacey, slowcore-indebted “Revival,” which follows opener “Big Dogs,” or the gently rolling “Gold Thread,” which extends and explores musical themes introduced in “Initiation.” These blood-pressure-lowering respites make the album’s moments of breakthrough hit even harder. “Witness,” also written in the wake of Thomson’s mother’s death, has a roller coaster’s momentum: When a tight rhythm and strummed chords in the verse give way to a more elastic beat and gracefully ambling guitar lines, it feels like a fist unclenching. Later, a similar musical build erupts into full-on release; the whole band is propelled powerfully forward by the heaviness of loss, a “feeling” that “would kill you,” as Sinaiko and Thomson shout. When the song downshifts and sways into its final moments, the effect is dizzying. The closing track, also an elegy, likewise spends its final minutes in poignant slow burn. Thomson has said the song is about learning and re-learning that, in grief, there is no one right way to feel, and there’s no way out but through. After Thomson sings the song’s final lines, the band continues to play for a few minutes more, gaining intensity then slowly receding, as if working through these changing and overwhelming emotions together, in real time.

GAS,GAS,8.3,Electronic,"Since 1997’s Zauberberg, the ambient techno albums under Wolfgang Voigt’s GAS alias have formed an aesthetically complete unit held together by psychedelically blurred forest artwork and a deep-rooted awe of the universe’s terrifying vastness. Yet the Cologne producer seemed to have trouble reconciling that opus with the project’s self-titled 1996 debut. The Nah und Fern comp, released in 2008, swapped out two of the debut album’s tracks for new ones more of a piece with the later records; 2016’s Box set omitted the 1996 LP entirely. Voigt seems to think of it as an outlier in the GAS catalog, which in a few crucial respects it is. The cover is an indistinct yellow blotch reminiscent of Bathory’s Gula Geten, and the soundscape is more given to billowing walls of shoegaze than the ghostly vinyl crackle he introduced on Zauberberg. A new reissue on Kompakt lets GAS stand on its own, giving it room to breathe and sprawl. This is the first reissue of the album’s original, pre-Nah und Fern incarnation since its initial release on Mille Plateaux, and its most immediately striking quality is its sheer size. While the Nah und Fern version runs a little over an hour, the original CD version nearly maxed out the format’s capacity. The 3xLP runs a whopping 92 minutes, its six tracks averaging a hair past 15 minutes apiece, each one stretching comfortably across an entire side of an LP. (The digital download also features all six tracks in their full-length versions.) Voigt might see GAS as a test run for later brilliance, but it’s hard to argue it’s a minor work when in scale alone it so thoroughly dwarfs its kin—a Jupiter among Earths. Many of the hallmarks of the GAS project are already here, not least the shimmering backwards guitar that courses through 1998’s sad, autumnal Königsforst and which makes its first appearance on “GAS 2” as it endlessly circles a major-chord resolution. Voigt’s trademark kick drum thumps as forebodingly as ever, accompanied by a hi-hat that would largely disappear from the later recordings. And like Zauberberg, it begins and ends with beatless drifts before the kick arrives to ferry us deeper into the album. What really sets it apart from the later GAS albums is that the forest imagery has not yet developed. Voigt drew the inspiration for the later albums from a complex and personal tangle of associations, centered on his youthful acid trips in Germany’s Königsforst and a desire to tie the “deep soul of German techno” to some even deeper truth contained within the land itself. On Zauberberg, the vinyl crackles reach out of the mix like grasping branches, while stirring orchestral samples sourced from German Romantic music convey deep unease. It’s music of the earth, flecked by dirt and decayed by time. Suffused in hiss and wind-tunnel noise, GAS more plainly suggests the state of matter implied in the project name, less akin to the vinyl séances of Philip Jeck and Leyland Kirby than the primordial ambient psych that was then being made across the Atlantic by Kranky artists Bowery Electric and Windy & Carl. A precedent can be heard on Voigt’s excellent earlier 1996 release Las Vegas, recorded with Jörg Burger as Burger/Ink. That album’s frequent references to Roxy Music suggested an abstraction of the group’s Avalon-era suavity, which may have been why Matador picked it up as the American indie label’s inaugural electronic release in 1998. GAS is closer to that album’s gauzy sound than to the later GAS recordings’ classical grandeur. It’s just a shade more rock than the others. GAS has a less distinct emotional tenor than the later albums, which reflect different phases of Voigt’s youthful psychedelic experiences—the prickly paranoia of Zauberberg, the comedown melancholy of Königsforst, the pure-trip headscapes of 2000’s Pop. GAS is neutral, kind of fuzzy, more evocative of a dream state than the zoomed-in reflections that happen on LSD. It’s the subtlest GAS album, allowing the listener to create their own associations without any mythology, context, or visual aids. GAS makes a stronger impression the longer it’s allowed to run. This is music to get lost in, so more is better. In its full 92-minute version, it begins to take on some of the same meditative, mind-numbing qualities as La Monte Young or Charlemagne Palestine’s drones—it’s psychedelic through sensory deprivation rather than sensory overload. The two tracks not on Nah und Fern are “GAS 1” and “GAS 3,” which Voigt replaced with dusky orchestral miasmas drawn from the same aesthetic palette as Königsforst. They’re nothing to scoff at—“GAS 1” bellows and roars like a tornado trapped inside a jewel case, while “GAS 3” loops a lustrous snatch of organ that disappears in and out of patches of silence—but it’s not difficult to make out the click where the loops end, and they rely on incessant repetition rather than the freeform drift of Zauberberg’s samples. GAS may be fated to be one of those classic albums with no definitive version, but this new reissue makes it more clear than ever that it’s a great (if transitional) album. Rather than approaching it in the context of the music Voigt would make later, it’s more rewarding to approach it from the other side of the timeline and see it as the moment Voigt’s romantic, idiosyncratic, deeply personal vision found its grandest expression yet.",1,"September 10, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gas-gas/
Undeath,More Insane,7.5,Metal,"In the 1970s, Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Lynn Swann set the NFL on fire with a previously unseen level of nimble athleticism. Once his accomplishments began to prompt high-profile interviews, their headlines largely focused on one unique aspect of Swann’s background: This star of America’s roughest, most physical sport was a trained ballet dancer. Many other aspiring pro footballers have turned to ballet in years since, all looking to gain an edge via the artform’s intricate footwork and body control. Rochester, New York’s Undeath play old-school death metal, a style of music whose public reputation mirrors football’s: aggressive and physically taxing, but perhaps not graceful. It’s also a genre with a sizable contingent that resists too much innovation. While many of death metal’s originators have survived for decades without diversifying their sound, younger bands often sound stale while trying to recapture the magic that Florida and Gothenburg produced in the ’90s. But on Undeath’s first two albums, they reinvigorated the style’s hallmarks without reinventing the wheel, thanks to their knack for memorable composition. On More Insane, their third album, Undeath show what Swann’s athletic approach might look like applied to the genre, using fluid dexterity to enhance their heaviness. The album’s loose narrative follows survivors of a nuclear-driven zombie apocalypse who resort to increasingly grotesque methods to save humanity. Most memorably, as Jones sings on ”Sutured for War,” this involves a form of body modification: stitching corpses to oneself to wield “auxiliary limbs and weapons galore.” This imagery mirrors Undeath’s treatment of various existing modes of death metal on More Insane. ’90s Florida still has firm grasp on the reins, but Swedish melo-death, punk-influenced d-beat, wankier ’80s guitar heroics, and mathier passages in the Mastodon/Lamb Of God tradition pop up to deliver kill-shots—all of which Undeath deploy with tasteful finesse. Undeath have already proven themselves masters of infectious, straightforward death metal bangers. On the heels of 2022’s It’s Time… To Rise From the Grave, which tightened their sound by stripping it down to its essential elements, More Insane shows the band spicing up their formula. There’s nothing here that would sound out of place on the last album, but the new record’s best songs recognize the boredom that might set in after two verses and choruses of even the most skillful OSDM, and subsequently dazzle in their respective final thirds. On More Insane, Undeath treat breakdowns—usually fun, uncomplicated payoffs in otherwise labyrinthine OSDM—like dance recitals, a chance to show off a wide range of skills in quick succession. Opener “Dead From Beyond” teases a traditionally brutal lick for 10 seconds before unveiling a clean guitar solo, which is just as swiftly subsumed by a return to the chorus. “Brandish The Blade,” already the most melodic Undeath song through its first two-thirds, unexpectedly pivots to 20 seconds of Iron Maiden-style harmonized leads. Even though these gymnastic feats don’t often pop up in the formational meat of the songs—save for the neoclassical and/or “Hotel California”-esque waves of guitar in “Sutured For War”— the savvy required to pull them off permeates throughout More Insane. Overall, it results in Undeath’s most complex release: dizzyingly ornate but never obliged to make concessions to trendier styles. It’s not entirely fair to evaluate a band that’s so deeply devoted to a specific genre tradition solely on the changes it makes between albums. There are death metal hard-liners who will knock More Insane for its very slight deviations from the norm, and more casual fans who might find it rigidly traditional compared to something like Blood Incantation’s recent prog odyssey. It is heartening, though, to see Undeath remain so confident in their identity while reexamining their fundamentals, adding newfound potency to their sound.

Charli XCX,BRAT,8.6,Pop/R&B,"It’s the era of the relatable pop star, where the Machiavellian hustlers of the music industry A-list write songs about being as unlucky and confused as you and I. These days, the world’s biggest musicians are apparently also the salt of the earth, perpetually downtrodden by their relationships or jobs. They’re down bad but they’re doing the work, jamming the radio with songs about setting boundaries or learning their moon sign. And have you heard? Their latest album is their most vulnerable to date, despite the public’s seeming allergy to moral ambiguity and the sense that it’s been years since anyone was remotely honest about their motivations. Are you having fun yet? Meanwhile, Charli XCX has been dreaming of a time when the It Girls were hot messes, flashing the paparazzi as they tumbled from the Chateau or looking feral outside Les Deux at 4 a.m. on a Tuesday. The Bimbo Summit’s on her mood board, as are the neon-splattered club nights of the mid- to late-2000s, back when dance music was in its bedroom-producer phase and pop singers were still divas who’d never condescend that they were anything like you. It’s a vibe that’s rather popular as of late. (Oh, to be a creative director tasked with explaining “indie sleaze” to Camila Cabello.) But Charli lived it, albeit as an English teenager whose MySpace demos had titles like “Art Bitch,” raging vicariously through the blogosphere. BRAT, the sixth album from the 31-year-old songwriter, has roots in this stretch of the aughts, which holds a tenuous claim to the last IRL gasp of “alternative culture” before it moved into our phones. It’s also a reaction, as Charli’s records tend to be: to the focus-grouped monotony of playlist-fodder pop, the tedium of our current “authenticity” obsession, and to her previous album, 2022’s Crash, which posed the question: “What might it sound like if I did sell out?” If you read trendy literature or spend much time on “X,” you might recognize the mode of defensive self-awareness, pre-empting the possibility of sounding like an idiot or looking like a flop. That album—on which she utilized for the first time in a decade the A&R services of her label, Atlantic Records—was her first to top the UK Albums Chart. But it lacked the culture-shifting oomph of a Vroom Vroom or Pop 2, records that felt like risks that no one else would take. Joining their category and transcending it, BRAT arrives as the best-sounding version of the Charli XCX promise to make the Apollonian pop landscape Dionysian again. The moment bent to Charli as the winter turned to spring, beginning with the February Boiler Room set that broke the company’s RSVP record within a matter of hours. In a sweaty Bushwick warehouse, alongside BRAT producers A. G. Cook and EasyFun, she debuted the album’s first single, “Von dutch,” whose revving synths trigger flashbacks to the mid-’00s electro of Boys Noize and the Bloody Beetroots, with a hitch before the drop you can feel inside your gut. “It’s okay to just admit that you’re jealous of me,” she yelps, winking but meaning it. The imperial streak continues on its follow-up, “Club classics,” over whose stripped-down bounce she declares her intentions to dance to her own tracks all night. Is it just me or is “360” her best pure pop tune in ages? (The video, teeming with It Girls, feels heavy-handed but not unearned.) For years, both Charli and her critics seemed distractingly obsessed with her position—the darling of the underground who either would or could not graduate to Main Pop Girl. Then something shifted, and it hardly seemed to matter. She had something they didn’t. She was cool. With the charts full of warmed-over disco and weepy Reddit-detective pop, I’d have happily accepted 15 high-end throwback bangers about being iconic and dressing like you’re on The Simple Life, as Charli seemed to tease. And as an homage to French dance music of the late ’90s and 2000s, from the euphoric filter house of Crydamoure and Roulé to Ed Banger’s heavy metal disco, BRAT delivers. I hear Bangalter and Braxe in the compressed ecstasy of “Talk talk,” the sweetness of Breakbot on “Apple,” shades of DJ Mehdi’s piano drama on “Mean girls.” “Rewind,” a love letter to MySpace-era naivety, is served up in ditzy spoken word somewhere between Uffie’s “Pop the Glock” and The Teaches of Peaches. Charli reprises the affect on “Girl, so confusing,” a song that busts the floodgates of a dozen “indie dance” memories I was certain I’d repressed. Not once in 42 minutes does the momentum fade. But past the singles, Charli complicates the idea she’s introduced of the imperious bad bitch whose ideas the world loves to jack, beginning to explore much more fascinating themes: jealousy, narcissism, “girl power.” On “I might say something stupid,” whose Gesaffelstein piano chords distill the essence of early Justice, she returns to her liminal position in the industry, describing with writerly precision the feeling of being the least famous person at the party: “Snag my tights out on the lawn chair/Guess I’m a mess and play the role.” I’ve never had a Charli lyric bounce around my head the way that lines from “Apple” have, with its curious fruit allegory and wonderfully vague remarks about driving to the airport. On “Sympathy is a knife,” whose buzzsaw synths and modulated banshee howls sound most like the Charli we’ve known, she spirals over an acquaintance who taps her insecurities: “I couldn’t even be her if I tried.” (“Don’t want to see her backstage at my boyfriend’s show,” she goes on. “Fingers crossed behind my back, I hope they break up quick.” Wait…) There are a handful of cute songs clearly directed to said boyfriend, the 1975’s George Daniel, now her fiancé. But BRAT’s most intriguing moments regard her relationships with women, which she unpacks with striking candor. The pop feminist discourse of the past decade never seemed to make it to the topic of competition, but on the sparkly/scuzzy “Girl, so confusing,” Charli goes there, painting a picture of a peer to whom she’s frequently compared, who’s either her long-lost BFF or perhaps wants to see her eat shit—it’s hard to say. (Surely Deuxmoi will have a field day with lines like “You’re all about writing poems, but I’m about throwing parties,” but for now let’s enjoy the mystery.) If you’re a certain kind of online, you’ll pretty quickly recognize the motifs of “Mean girls”: cigarettes, vocal fry, daddy issues, Catholicism. Yes, it’s the first major label pop song inspired by the Red Scare podcast. It’s also a counter—a catchy one, at that—to what the “Relatable Era” demands of artists. Is there a way to be a pop star without being a role model? Can a woman feel empowered without being a girlboss? Can she reject the pose of perma-victim and still make resonant art? These ideas feel substantial in new ways for Charli. Writing BRAT, she quieted her inner industry pro who strung together vowel sounds and buzzwords that rhymed, approaching her lyrics as if she were typing a gossipy text to a friend. The method worked, nudging songs about subjects like grief and motherhood past the usual clichés of “confessional writing” and into reality. The somber “So I” is about missing SOPHIE, Charli’s late mentor; it’s also about how terrifying it can be to be friends with a genius. Much ink will be spilled about “I think about it all the time,” where a visit to a friend who recently became a mother inspires life-altering questions about what her freedom’s worth. But what gives the story life is the striking admission that, alongside tenderness and joy, she feels a sting of jealous FOMO: “She’s a radiant mother and he’s a beautiful father, and now they both know these things that I don’t.” You might call it her most vulnerable record to date, if you’re into that sort of thing.

Ka,The Thief Next to Jesus,8.1,Rap,"It took a sense of righteous outrage for Martin Luther to nail his Ninety-five Theses to the door of Wittenberg’s All Saints’ Church in 1517, emphatically announcing his opposition to the Roman Catholic Church’s practice of selling indulgences in exchange for salvation. It’s unclear what the final straw was for Ka, but the Brownsville rapper delivers a similar diatribe with his stunning, strident new album, The Thief Next to Jesus. Spotlighting the fraught relationship between Christianity and Black Americans, the rapper born Kaseem Ryan explores the hypocrisy of a religion that preaches deliverance yet subjugates its followers—and argues the urgent need to reframe that bond. Ka is no stranger to ambitious themes. He’s utilized chess (The Night’s Gambit in 2013), Greek mythology (Orpheus vs. the Sirens in 2018), and feudal Japanese codes (2016’s Honor Killed the Samurai) as conduits for self-analysis. He has mined his upbringing to craft cinematic epics that covertly lead you down the pain-filled alleyways of the city that raised him. On The Thief Next to Jesus, he displays tunnel-vision focus as he takes aim at the complicated links between Black Americans and Christianity. Ka’s albums have long been rooted in Biblical allegories. His 11th solo album feels like a spiritual extension of his 2019 release Descendants of Cain, where he invoked the story of Abel’s brother to portray himself as having been forsaken by the world. This time he calls upon the tale of the thieves on the cross: Both mocked Jesus, but one repented, receiving last-minute salvation before being crucified. The rapper knows what it means to see redemption slip away; left by the wayside by a religion that preaches eternal love, he seeks a new relationship with spirituality. Ka’s bluntness is his superpower as he pulls off some of the clearest writing of his recent run. Tying his autobiographical bars to Christian canon makes it sounds as though Ka’s passed through a baptism by fire. “Thought I’d be finished in the gutter sooner/Every other corner was crack spots,” he raps on “Broken Rose Window,” relating tales of hardship and alienation in Brooklyn. Much of Ka’s allure stems from the way he packs his worldview into singular phrases wound so tightly that they’re made to feel like secret koans that you carry in your heart until you need them: “I plan my death before I plan submission,” he declares on “Borrowed Time.” Simple sentences land with the impact of grand soliloquies, unfurling his philosophical dogma in just a few words. Using understated, purposeful phrases and fragments, Ka draws you in, forcing you to hang onto each word. His delivery is patient and measured, with a steely intensity that’s unshakeable, as if he’s never been more assured in his path forward. Breaking down the tools used to oppress Black folks has always been at the forefront of Ka’s writing, and the frank manner in which he parses and critiques the Black American connection to Christianity here produces stunning moments. He sketches heart-wrenching vignettes about the ways that religion abetted enslavement (“Tested Testimony”), acts of terror, and violent subjugation (“Cross You Bear”), while also forcing generations of Black people to feel dependent on Christianity for salvation (“God Undefeated”). These scenes rub up against meditations on Ka’s own spirituality: “Ain’t nothing shook about me but my faith/A couple hundred years asking, nothing kept us safe… still do us the same, we in the same place,” he spits on “Fragile Faith,” his veil lifted after the promised saviors have fallen short. Some of Ka’s other records are more lush, with more varied production. But the consistent tenor of the album’s trudging piano and triumphant organ samples is nevertheless magnetic, making Ka’s subdued voice register like that of a patient pastor. The self-produced project reveals him as a master of tone, while showcasing gospel music’s seductive pull. Take the call-and-response sample on “Beautiful,” where Ka’s one-liners volley with the choir’s chants, turning the track into a vibrant modern-day hymn as the organ pounds in the background. Or “Collection Plate,” which is buoyed by nothing more than sampled Hallelujahs and trilling keys that whisper in the background. Rather than pushing himself to make overblown artistic statements, Ka chooses minimalism. You can look at the spoken-word sample on “Soul and Spirit” as a crucial turn on The Thief Next to Jesus: “What has made gospel live,” explains an unidentified speaker, “is the message that the rhythm and the beat carry.” Ka always existed firmly in the blues tradition of rap music, using melancholy to probe the struggles and pain that plague him—and the love that saves him. But here, he adopts an advanced version of the shepherd role he took up on Languish Arts and Woeful Studies. On the opening “Bread, Wine, Body, Blood,” he laments the deluge of rap without substance, warning others not to be the “weapon they use to harm you.” From the voice of a less sympathetic orator, this could register as hating or dismissive—but Ka, who has sifted through the pieces of his own trauma and continued to put one foot in front of the other, is only interested in showing you the light.",0,"August 28, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ka-the-thief-next-to-jesus/
Kehlani,Crash,6.8,Pop/R&B,"On Kehlani’s last album, 2022’s blue water road, the L.A.-based singer-songwriter dove into the comforts of love via airy guitar pop. It was a slight adjustment to their formula following albums rife with heated R&B and moody atmosphere, a new wrinkle reflecting a maturing sensitivity to tales of love lost and won. On Crash, Kehlani’s fourth studio album, they turn once again, this time toward a grab bag of genres that reflect the dizzying ups and downs of desire and self-examination. While it often sounds like Kehlani is trying on a series of flashy outfits to see which one fits best, it’s still exhilarating when Crash dials up their signature swagger. For Kehlani, the titular crash symbolizes a sudden, brief spike of emotion. The album evokes that intensity through freewheeling music that roves between styles, occasionally within the same song: buoyant dancehall, trap-inflected R&B, and country-tinged ballads are just a few of the flavors Kehlani whips up. Halfway through opener “GrooveTheory,” they switch from girl-group croons to stomping come-ons with the click of a radio dial. “Let’s make a movie/Then come and show me the sequel,” they purr, offering an easy inroad to Crash’s frisky point of view. On the similarly slow-burning “Sucia,” Kehlani gets an assist from Jill Scott, who shows up in sultry spoken-word mode, and Puerto Rican rapper Young Miko, who slides on the song’s beat with slinky ease. It’s a moody highlight that depicts Kehlani in the depths of lust: “I don’t want Miami, I want Medellín/Take you from the party to the trampoline,” they urge. That focus on desire courses throughout most of Crash, lending its best songs a flirty levity. On “What I Want,” Kehlani threads a chip-tuned Christina Aguilera sample with trap hi-hats and thundering bass, giving it a darkened glower that ratchets up the bravado. It’s one of the stronger, more deliberate sample choices on Crash, fresher than much of the nostalgia bait that runs rampant in contemporary pop and R&B. “After Hours” achieves a similar flex, rewiring the riddim popularized by Nina Sky’s classic “Move Ya Body” into a breezy plea for a longer night with a lover; it’s a featherlight, upbeat reinterpretation that doubles as an expert showcase for Kehlani’s vocals, which across Crash sound more syrupy and relaxed than ever. When Crash slows down, the results are more mixed. On the pared-back ballad “Better Not,” Kehlani reaches for a country-tuned wistfulness that treads too close to faceless folk-rock. “Vegas,” with its keening, ’80s-nodding guitar solos, suffers a similar fate and simultaneously falls into cliched songwriting (“What happens here stays here”) that winds up sounding like a marketing campaign. It’s emblematic of some of Crash’s less imaginative songs, like the “crying in the club” motif that runs through the chorus of the dancehall-tinged, Omah Lay-featuring “Tears.” The lyrics can feel like an afterthought, even when Kehlani’s sheer charisma and honey-smooth delivery makes them go down easy. Kehlani recovers on “Deep,” a highlight that unfurls a spread of bass-heavy psych-rock to take stock of their tumultuous life story. Featuring background vocals from family including their daughter, the song recalls Rihanna’s cathartic, conflicted ANTI, with a careening chorus that rides on Kehlani’s trilling, emotive delivery and heavy, skull-rattling beats. Tracing an arc from sleeping on a concrete floor to present-day success, it’s the kind of sharp, introspective work that colors Kehlani’s best music: a welcome counter to some of Crash’s excesses.

MJ Lenderman,Manning Fireworks,8.7,Rock,"In an MJ Lenderman song, the extraordinary is always elbowing its way into the mundane. His 2022 breakthrough album, Boat Songs, thrived on these situations. One minute someone was clinically depressed on the Six Flags log flume, the next they were locked in a spat about a “dumb hat” outside a butcher shop. “Being really sad or upset while wearing a costume,” he told Pitchfork last year, “that’s funny.” Over the last couple of years—as he signed with Anti- and remained a guitarist and songwriter in the great Southern indie rock band Wednesday, alongside his now ex-partner Karly Hartzman—Lenderman became a cult folk hero for people willing to talk about their feelings if they could couch it in a joke about Jackass. I had originally clocked Manning Fireworks as more of the same, where Lenderman relies on this one weird trick to write sincere but ultimately unserious songs. I was wrong. Lenderman has honed his songwriting such that I’d nominate a couplet for short story of the year: “Kahlúa shooter/DUI scooter.” He’s got lines that’ll paint a stupid grin on your face: “I could really use your two cents, babe/I could really use the change,” or, “Is it the quiet hiss of a midnight piss/Or a river turned to creek?” If his folk-rock forebears, like Neil Young and Jason Molina, were drawn to the mystics of the natural world, Lenderman is drawn to the mystics of the shitty apartment, simple and unvarnished songs born of small screens in small rooms in small towns. His writing style conjures the dark, dry wit of Warren Zevon. The men who populate Lenderman and Zevon’s songs are pure losers, divorcés, badgering or self-effacing romantics working on their last-ever heartbreak. Both artists also know how to open a song with a zinger: “Well I can saw a woman in two/But you won’t wanna look in the box when I am through,” Zevon once sang. It’s such a Lenderman line, especially if you imagine him singing it at half the speed Zevon does. “Burdened by those wet dreams/Of people having fun,” opens Lenderman, staring into the middle distance on the mid-tempo rocker “On My Knees.” This is, mind you, the second time he’s sung about cum on Manning Fireworks. Really, it’s unfair to say that Lenderman writes about cum and piss and cartoons and video games. He does, but it’s the style and economy in which he renders them, as if he’s brushing them in gold leaf. “Rudolph” opens with this: Rudolph waking up in the roadDew dripping off his red noseBlue and black, tire trackTorn through a beautiful doeDeleted scene of Lightning McQueenBlacked out at full speed This alone might cast him as the Will Hunting of indie rock, a secret classicist with the pen where you wonder what would happen if he actually applied himself and wrote about, you know, the moon or something. But Lenderman uses this goofy, carefully written scene to tee up real feelings of desire, the same way playing Ozzy Osbourne’s “Bark at the Moon” on Guitar Hero is deployed as a pitiful admission of unworldliness to someone he loves who is “in on my bit” and “sick of the schtick.” It’d be too self-conscious if it weren’t so honest. It’s so great to hear Lenderman find his voice, this hangdog underachiever slowly telling a joke whose every punchline is missin’, leavin’, or lovin’ you. Like the writing on Manning Fireworks, Lenderman’s guitar playing is simple and understated: The riffs are slow-rolled and the solos are short and sweet. One little five-note line carries the mid-life crisis anthem “She’s Leaving You,” leading to Lenderman taking a loud but patient solo that is perhaps a little too underplayed. A Southern breeze drifts in from the occasional lap steel played by Xandy Chelmis, and Landon George takes a great turn on the fiddle on the front porch ballad “Rip Torn.” The whole thing sounds polished and synchronized, nothing fractured or lo-fi about it. No one’s shredding or busting out; everyone is just nodding along, casually scoring the slow pace of life and all its little foibles and misfortunes. This sound is part of what makes Lenderman so endearing—he could convince you to savor the feeling of a warm beer. It all peaks with the great “Wristwatch,” a new signature song whose protagonist is another sad idiot. Making Frank Ocean’s real estate propositions seem sound, he’s got a beach house up in Buffalo and a “houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome,” which is one of the most memorable lines you’ll encounter all year. A vocal harmony locks in on the chorus when he looks down at his stupid little smartwatch that tells him he’s all alone, pathetic and amazing.

Body Meat,Starchris,8.2,Experimental,"It wasn’t that long ago that a casual reference to “LARPing” would instantly get you banished to the dorkiest table at the cafeteria. If only those kids could have known that one day, “side quest” would just as commonly describe a trip to score ketamine as an opportunity to bust out the 20-sided dice. Chris Taylor’s always managed to split the difference, juggling the sleek pop sensibilities of a club-hopper with the type of obsessive engineering that only comes from late nights spent burying your head in software. That contrast lives in his music as Body Meat: Blake-ian vocal hooks get chopped up against mutant MIDI rhythms partway between Nyege Nyege and Nobuo Uematsu, and no cartoonishly obtuse sound is too stiff to loosen up into an elastic excuse to dance. Starchris, Body Meat’s long-awaited full-length debut, makes it seem as if all the various genres and sounds currently percolating through our world might’ve been secretly emanating from his all along. Rage beats tumble into hyperspeed rave-ups; post-SOPHIE sound design squiggles alongside mangled Afrobeats and teeth-gnashing nu-metal. It’s the kind of genre-splitting that’s become a hallmark of hyperpop, but Starchris never comes off like a gimmicky mashup. Instead, Taylor explores what these styles have in common: how competing bass patterns can interlock, the way a slight vocal tic can set up an impending drop, the exact moment when a track pushes the listener from a head nod into a full-body flux, and how to subdivide that sensation even further. As plugged-in as all his fastidiously designed timbres might make him seem, Taylor’s approach is decidedly old-school in spirit. A DIY lifer who cut his teeth in Denver and Philly’s experimental scenes before finally ending up in New York, his music is more of a piece with the underground art-rock of decades past: the Zach Hills and Deerhoofs of this world whose acrobatic musicianship could only be outpaced by their need to deploy it for the silliest purposes imaginable. Throughout Starchris, Taylor decodes the anything-goes outlook of the modern internet addict and brings it hurtling into the real world. On “Crystalize,” after two woozy minutes of plastic psychedelia where Taylor’s buzzy tones seem to be going eight different directions at once, the most surprising moment of all comes when he locks into a straight-ahead 4/4 groove. Layering it with blown-out synths and a marimba arpeggio that would be at home in a Banjo-Kazooie boss fight, Taylor holds just enough reign over his discombobulating ideas to steer them through one thrilling detour after another. The unifying principle of Taylor’s work is rhythm: stretching it out, tightening it up, and working it like a muscle. “People call them weird rhythms,” he told Pitchfork in 2019 about the response to his music, “but in other cultures these rhythms are normal. If you listen to Middle Eastern music, they think of rhythm in a completely different way. It’s not weird. They just got more groove.” Taylor, whose Ethiopian dad played congas with Earth, Wind & Fire, rarely leaves his beats in the same place he found them; “North Side” opens on a twinkling ballad of tongue clicks and Minecraft flickers as Taylor confesses that he “sold 15 of your swords” like they were plums in an icebox. Halfway through, the track erupts into a booming Afrobeat and Taylor’s croon shoots up and down at the same time, pitch-shifted to a chipmunk squeak on one end, dropped down an octave on the other. “I can feel it in my surrounding Wi-Fi,” he rumbles as the track crashes about in a polyrhythmic whirlpool. You can sense the simulation glitching. Perhaps as a consequence of Taylor’s interest in designing video games, empty space and its governing laws are just as important to his songs as what fills it. Sparse, ringtone-like beeps set the stage for a trance-y tumble into cyber-pop on “Focus,” while the Earth-rumbling “High Beams” tees up a booming beat drawing from F1lthy’s rage rap framework, then cranks it further and further into the red. Even his calmer songs distort their environments in subtle ways: “Electrische” starts out as a buildup of skipping beats, until a footwork-y bass pattern comes in and the whole thing drops out. When Taylor brings the beat back, it comes swathed in slow, cloudy chords that cast the track into a Basic Channel-esqe ether. It’s as if he’s not trying to catch up with the beats anymore, but just floating between them. Connecting all these scattershot sounds is Taylor’s own Auto-Tuned voice, which glides through his songs with R&B softness, waiting to be torn apart. Though occasionally he lets it hover sweetly, often he willfully mangles his clean tone into something uglier. Halfway through “The Mad Hatter,” Taylor questions his own state of mind, melismatically declaring, “I’m not ready to say it out loud,” before his voice gets whisked up into the sky like a runaway helium balloon. “Focus” ends with him speeding up his own vocal cuts until the sample sounds as if it’s hyperventilating. Taylor treats his own breathy grunts and sidewinding vocal runs with the same granular detail as the rest of his rubbery textures, slurring together glints of half-remembered moments from radio hits into a shimmering miasma. Starchris can be disorienting, but it never feels like chaos is the point. Taylor’s most impressive feat might just be how naturally he melds all these bizarre fragments, taking concepts that could seem insular and building welcoming pathways toward them. He sounds more in control of his songs than ever, taking time to gradually lay their foundations, tease out their possibilities, and let the momentum swell. Toward the end of the climactic, eight-minute “Ōbu No Seirei (Spirit of an Orb),” Taylor cuts through a prismatic sound field of artificially plucked cellos and breathy flutes to lay down a heaving industrial groove. “I don’t want to live like this,” he sighs as the track descends into an uncanny, nightmarish throb. The rhythm unfurls, and Taylor’s voice begins to eerily loop: “I can’t move,” he aches over and over. He sings it as if there couldn’t be a worse fate.

BASIC,This Is BASIC,7.6,Rock / Experimental,"Few people understood Basic when it came out and even fewer liked it. By 1984, Robert Quine was already legendary for his guitar work on Richard Hell and the Voidoids’ Blank Generation and Lydia Lunch’s Queen of Siam. He had recorded several albums with Lou Reed, who he adored and hated in equal measure, and with whom he constantly clashed. The notoriously contentious Quine had done his time in the New York City underground and was sick of being sidelined by its outsized personalities. He decided to join up with Reed’s drummer Fred Maher and create a record exactly how he liked: a bizarre mix of programmed drums, ambient drift, and indulgent guitar explorations. These sounds were outré at the time, but they quickly became dated. Quine didn’t care. “On Basic, the drums are too loud and this and that but that's the way I wanted it,” he said in 1997. “If people don't appreciate the damn thing, I have no interest in banging my head against the wall.” According to Philadelphia guitarist Chris Forsyth, everybody’s gotten it wrong. He places Quine in the company of Miles Davis, Brian Eno, and Joni Mitchell and compares Basic to their landmark albums. Quine and Maher’s overlooked record has influenced Forsyth’s music for years, most obviously on the 20-minute guitar workout “Techno Top” from 2019’s All Time Present. But he wasn’t as alone as he thought—a resurgence of interest in Quine’s work was underway, and he was thrilled to discover that his Solar Motel Band guitarist Nick Millevoi was also a fan. During the pandemic lockdowns, Forsyth and Millevoi got together with a drum machine, using Basic as a conceptual starting point for dual-guitar jams. They quickly discovered that the collaboration made sense even to people who didn’t know about Robert Quine. And so they recruited a percussionist, Natural Information Society’s Mikel Patrick Avery, and started a band. In honor of their foundational text, they called it BASIC. Here are the basic elements of a This is BASIC song: polyrhythmic drum programming a bit too high in the mix, like Quine would’ve done; Avery’s percussion adding a steady groove; Millevoi’s thundering baritone guitar; and Forsyth’s lead lines ringing out over top. When they play live, Avery sits behind a bass drum, cowbell, and shaker, with two guitarists flanking him. Everyone can always see each other; this friendly surveillance is necessary for the band’s semi-improv. On “For Stars of the Air,” the album’s sprawling, nine-minute opener, Forsyth adds chiming harmonics over the drum machine’s jittery hi-hat until Millevoi steps in with shuddering waves of baritone, allowing Forsyth to move along to an intricate, flanged-out solo. Only after this interplay is established does Avery complicate the beat, propelling the group forward in double time. Once any two players lock into a pattern, the third is free to roam until he finds a new fixation, and so each track can change direction with a nod or a reciprocal glance: We’ve got this, go your own way. Of course, BASIC are more than Basic. They mine from other ’80s acts too, including the Durutti Column’s pristine chorus-pedal shimmer on “Positive Halfway” and the Clean’s upbeat jangle on “Nerve Time.” But structurally, this is modern stuff: Like a less shambolic version of 75 Dollar Bill or a more shambolic version of the Bill Orcutt Guitar Quartet, the band repeats simple parts with such insistence and drive that they turn minimalism into maximalism. On “New Auspicious,” Forsyth plays the same eight-note figure again and again over Millevoi’s galloping rhythm guitar. Then he decides to join the galloping himself. These two sections, with slight variations, alternate to form the whole of the song, and this repetition turns ecstatic exactly because it becomes so expected. Sometimes the desire to follow Quine, a rather myopic muse, leads BASIC into trouble. “Last Resort of the Gambling Man” aims for the ambient lull of Basic’s “Dark Place” but ends up listless instead. When Forsyth piles on effects like Quine does, as in the wild wah-wah of “Versatile Switch,” he risks sounding tasteless, too. But these are faults that BASIC are glad to share with their namesake, proof that they truly embrace its sound. For Basic’s devoted fan base, This Is BASIC is evidence, finally, of the album’s enduring influence. It took 40 years but people are beginning to appreciate the damn thing.",0,"September 17, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/basic-this-is-basic/
Floating Points,Cascade,8.0,Electronic,"In 2014, Sam Shepherd wrote a career-defining tune in a matter of minutes. “Nuits Sonores” was finished on a flight to the Lyon festival of the same name, and it sounds as effortless as it apparently was, climbing towards the heavens without boiling over into excess. This is one of Shepherd’s two main modes—when he’s not a jazz auteur, he’s a crack house and techno producer. (He also has a PhD in neuroscience and is a revered and adventurous selector behind the decks.) That other side has won him fame from all corners of the music industry, culminating in Promises, his 2021 collaboration with Pharoah Sanders. More recently, he’s been taking to huge festival stages with crossover DJs like Caribou and Four Tet, following them in their quests to infiltrate the mainstream on their own terms. All those parts of Floating Points are connected, but not always obviously. Enter Cascade, an album that bolsters Shepherd’s club cunning with his musical chops in service of one single-minded mission: blissing out on the dance floor. The rollout for Cascade started back in 2022 with “Vocoder,” an industrial-strength anthem to file alongside “Nuits Sonores” and 2019’s “LesAlpx.” “Vocoder (Club Mix)” opens the album in a boisterous rush, careening toward a breakdown of clipped vocal samples that spill out like a cargo of french fries from a turned-over semi. It’s nearly reckless by Floating Points standards, capturing that feeling when the strobes hit hard and you can’t tell if the lights are getting to you or you’re just more faded than you thought. The raucous album is a direct sequel to 2019’s aggressive Crush. On that record, Shepherd showcased his newfound mastery of modular synthesis, creating cresting waves of fuzz and distortion that bore down on fitful rhythms and unpredictable song structures—the result, he said, of opening huge venues for the xx and wanting to challenge the audience with “chaotic” music. This time he’s focused on making people move instead of befuddling them. Cascade is what happened when Shepherd wasn’t able to tour at all, an exorcism of dancefloor impulses impeded by the pandemic and then nurtured by the return of DJ gigs. In the midst of recording it, he decamped to the Southern California desert to write the score for a ballet, which makes Cascade a holiday and a reckoning all in one. These tracks redirect the jazzy vamp of classic records like Shadows into zig-zagging journeys, like those ’90s screen-saver mazes. The approach peaks with centerpiece “Fast Forward,” where jittery synth leads wrap around each other like a hissing Medusa head of countermelodies and surging textures. The melodies decay and detune in real time, highlighting Shepherd’s handiwork—electronic music you can practically hear breathing, growing, and dying. “Afflecks Palace” takes this idea and throws a swirl of conflicting emotions at it. A nostalgic trip through early IDM, acid house, and jungle, it’s wiry and unpredictable, held together with a thin thread thanks to Shepherd’s now considerable experience making this kind of stuff on the fly. There are softer moments, too. “Key103” wouldn’t sound out of place in a Maceo Plex set, with melancholy synths weighing down the otherwise springy drums, wax hardening around the joints. Standout “Ocotillo” features harpist Miriam Adefris and Shepherd playing his great aunt’s Clavichord to miniature music-box “Dueling Banjos” effect, full of gleaming nylon strings and fluttering, heart-in-mouth vocals. It conjures Four Tet with Shepherd’s typical musical precision. The closing suite of “Tilt Shift” and “Ablaze” starts out with sputtering IDM drums, but a doleful melody takes over along with wordless vocals from Hikaru Utada, the J-pop legend whose 2022 comeback album Shepherd co-produced. Moments like these—Utada’s presence on Cascade, live musicians elsewhere, superstar DJ friends—underline how far Shepherd has come since he was playing at Plastic People in London and being bashful about his career in neuroscience, as if it were something to be embarrassed about. Now all parts of Shepherd are on display, the scientist-DJ-producer-jazz-musician who can have his cake and eat it, too. Cascade’s focus on straight-up dance music might feel jarring compared to his other albums. I briefly, foolishly took “Vocoder” as Shepherd’s sell-out moment, but heard in the context of the five-hour Boiler Room set that Shepherd streamed to celebrate Cascade, it made sense in the context of the Brazilian disco and songs from Floating Points staples like Stevie Wonder. These tracks aren’t far removed from the curling grooves of “Vacuum Boogie” or “People’s Potential,” and they flow with an unstoppable energy that channels the spontaneous inspiration of “Nuits Sonores.” While he’s often lauded for his meticulousness, Cascade shows that Shepherd—whether in the studio, on stage, or cruising at 30,000 feet—is a master of winging it.

Lou Reed,The Blue Mask,9.2,Rock,"The three-minute guitar duet that kicks off 1974’s Rock ’n’ Roll Animal is kind of satanic when you know what’s coming: “Sweet Jane,” one of the most beautiful and important songs of all time, written by Lou Reed for the Velvet Underground, a beautiful and important band that felt like the last piece of the puzzle to teenage rock fans who discovered them during their renaissance in the early nineties. “Sweet Jane” is the song that liberated a generation from classic rock radio. It proved that you could write something durable without resorting to the exhausting riff-mongering of Foreigner or the idiot machismo of AC/DC. To hear this landmark of art rock used as a prog noodle pot by Reed’s touring band is a profoundly disorienting experience, but the whole album is like that. They do “Heroin” as the kind of uptempo funk that would later be used to get guests on and off of late-night TV. It all sounds very not Lou Reed, but by 1973 the question of what Lou Reed was had become unsettled. Fans who encountered Reed’s body of work in retrospect may be surprised to learn that Rock ’n’ Roll Animal was his first gold album. I urge you to listen to it—if only to understand what might have happened if he had been born an Allman Brother—at some point before you put on The Blue Mask, an album Reed would release almost a decade later, in 1982, after a series of semi-public crises including but not limited to: moving in with his parents, brakes-off methamphetamine abuse, the slow and occasionally violent end of his relationship with Rachel Humphreys, and asking David Bowie to produce his record seconds before drunkenly assaulting him. This period of personal disintegration coincided with a six-album run of legendarily confusing studio albums. My favorite is probably Street Hassle, which peaked at No. 89 on the Billboard charts. It contains the masterpiece title track but also the charitably-interpretable-as-satire “I Wanna Be Black,” a song that rhymes “have natural rhythm” with “shoot twenty feet of jism.” All Reed’s post-Rock ’n’ Roll Animal albums feel this way: for every good song, there are three that make you think he wrote the good one by accident, or that he is somehow mad at you for continuing to like him. The peak of this seeming hostility was Metal Machine Music, which Chuck Klosterman cited to illustrate his concept of the “advanced irritant,” an artist who has produced works of genius and then backslides to music that is simply bad. Still, I would rather listen to Metal Machine Music than Growing Up in Public, whose lyrics are disfigured by therapy-speak and whose instrumental arrangements sound alarmingly like Billy Joel. All this is to say that shortly before he turned 40, Reed had established himself as one of the saddest burnouts of all time. In the absence of artistic and commercial success, his mercurial persona and self-destructive habits made him look less like a rock star and more like an ordinary asshole: someone who had gotten what a generation of musicians dreamed of and traded it for what millions of dumb, violent addicts couldn’t escape. And then he dropped The Blue Mask. It sounded different from anything he had done before but was unmistakably him—the quote-unquote real Lou Reed everyone recognized but no one could duplicate, a sound that was at once new and a return to form. The first time I heard it, I assumed The Blue Mask was ironic; the second time, I began to suspect that it was the least ironic album of all time. It is strange, specific, and painfully honest, ugly in places and beautiful in others: in other words, a redemption story. Whatever Reed had lost over that last decade, artistically, he got it back. What changed? For one thing, he dramatically reduced his consumption of drugs and alcohol, although as with many addicts who get clean under their own supervision, how close he got to zero BAC is not clear. He also married Sylvia Morales, a younger painter and poet whom he met at CBGB in 1977. Mostly leaving New York City—Reed kept his rent-stabilized apartment in the Village—the two lived together in Blairstown, New Jersey, in a house in the woods near a lake. The first track of The Blue Mask, “My House,” is, at least on a literal level, about Reed’s belief that this home in Blairstown is not only “very beautiful at night” but also haunted by the spirit of his former college professor, the poet Delmore Schwartz. This idea is astonishingly self-centered, which is how you know Reed was getting sober. Taking stock, he sings that he’s got “a lucky life/My writing, my motorcycle, and my wife/And to top it all off, a spirit of pure poetry/Is living in this stone and wood house with me.” One can only imagine how thrilled Schwartz would be knowing that he was remembered as a figure of comparable importance to Reed’s motorcycle. But as with almost every track on this album, the real subject of “My House” is not the house or its appurtenances; it is Reed’s ongoing struggle to live productively amid the furnishings of his own mind. These furnishings are old but unfamiliar, as though Reed had awakened from a blackout and was looking at them for the first time—which, in many respects, he was. The alternately healthful and agonizing experience of seeing himself clearly is the central theme of The Blue Mask, and it is reflected in the alternately beautiful and grotesque sound of the instrumentation. These arrangements are even more expressive than the words, if only because they convey feeling unconstrained by meaning or circumstance and therefore parallel Reed’s dislocating new sobriety. The singular sound of The Blue Mask provides a counterpoint to Reed’s lyrics, nudging them over the line from kind of dumb to definitely dumb and therefore great. Two members of Reed’s new band seem to have been responsible for this sound. The first is Robert Quine, a former guitarist for the Voidoids and documented Lou Reed superfan who bootlegged a series of Velvet Underground shows in 1969, when he was trying and failing to pass the California bar. Quine’s guitar is on the left side of the stereo mix. On the right is Reed himself, whose return to playing guitar was reportedly a condition of Quine’s appearance. Together they developed a loose but steady sound that is atmospheric on tracks like “Women” but sharp and vital on the rockers—a sound reminiscent of Sticky Fingers-era Rolling Stones but slower, the honky tonk before it opens, while it still belongs to the staff. The second new player behind this sound was bassist Fernando Saunders, a 25-year-old hired gun whose work on The Blue Mask can be heard, in echoes, on many of the bass sounds in subsequent 1980s pop-rock albums. Playing at the front of the mix with sharp attack and the treble turned all the way up, Saunders makes the bass a midrange instrument, dropping fills from the top of the neck into the pauses in conversation between Reed’s vocals and the guitars. These bass fills are such an organizing feature of The Blue Mask that you can kind of guess when one is coming, e.g. “Seven days make a week [boing]/On two of them I sleep.” In addition to evoking the first step of a 12-step program, this moment from “Underneath the Bottle” suggests that punctuation from Saunders was what Reed’s writing needed all along. The other element of The Blue Mask that you can’t get out of your head, once you know its context, is how raw it all is—like a dental procedure put off too long. If “Underneath the Bottle” is the honest version of the cynical “The Power of Positive Drinking” that Reed recorded two years earlier, the title track and “Waves of Fear” are the price he paid for lying. “The Blue Mask” is a noise jam about S&M, kind of like “Venus in Furs” from The Velvet Underground & Nico, but in a way that does not make kinky sex sound at all hip or fun. “Cut the stallion at his mount/And stuff it in his mouth!” Reed shouts before the whole thing collapses into a disorganized guitar solo. It is kink as pathology rather than transgression, a too-clear reflection of insecurities and half-repressed failures that ends in humiliation instead of a downtown leather scene. “Waves of Fear” is about the psychological experience of withdrawal, the often ignored but undeniable place where your body rubs up against your mind. It is not in free time, and neither is it simply a jam; it has its own rhythm and structural logic, but that logic is awful in the biblical sense of the word. “Waves of fear/Squat on the floor/Looking for some pill/The liquor is gone/Blood drips from my nose/I can barely breathe/Waves of fear/I’m too scared to leave,” Reed sings with terrible specificity. Here, at age 39, is his penitence for two decades of songs about how drugs are cool. Here is the process of getting clean not as relief but as de-anesthetized surgery. Here, in other words, is the particularly ugly and beautiful experience of continuing to become Lou Reed. Not every track on the album reaches that level of fusion between form and content; some are simply failed experiments or regressions to post-Animal pandering. “Average Guy” is what I can only describe as some Joe Walsh shit: a snotty novelty song about how Reed is perfectly ordinary, ha ha. “The Day John Kennedy Died,” while more winsome in tone and seeming intent, ends on the line, “I dreamed that I could somehow comprehend that someone shot him in the face.” This historical inaccuracy brings to mind John Cale’s remark, in his autobiography, that Reed could be extremely funny without knowing when he was doing it. In the context of Reed’s lifelong willingness to embarrass himself twice to produce something beautiful once, though, it is these wabi-sabi elements that perfect the album. There is a video of the version of “The Blue Mask” that Reed and his band performed live in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 2000, in which the essentially two-note bass riff of the original has become a mastering pattern for the entire rhythm section—mostly D and then mostly G played over and over, tighter and seemingly harder each time, the cymbals just behind the beat. Reed is 58 years old. His face has settled into the William H. Macy grimace he would wear in the 21st century. When he begins to sing, he does so almost perfunctorily, in contrast to the driving energy of the arrangement, as though he had been mumbling these words to himself in elevators and on subway platforms for the last two decades. When I watch this video I think about how, at any moment, you can do or say or conceive something that will haunt you for the rest of your life. It might even be something good. The Blue Mask is good. After I heard it for the first time, I could not stop thinking about it for months. During that initial infatuation, I recommended it to several people, but since then I have become careful not to, because most of them turned out not to like it. I have come to think of that as part of the appeal. To paraphrase Wayne Campbell, we didn’t need Lou Reed to write songs that everybody liked; we left that to the Beatles. What we needed from Reed was that singular thing only he could render, with the conviction that no experience was so terrible it could not be redeemed as art, and if that thing that made it possible went away for a while, it would come back to you. And so it did. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Actress,Statik,7.9,Electronic,"An apprehensive energy charges the atmosphere just before a thunderstorm erupts. The light seems wrong, shadows washed out by the flat, sickly greenish hue of the sky. You can feel the air thinning as the barometric pressure drops, preparing for the coming gusts of wind and spiky torrents of rain or hail. Those moments seem to last forever, stretching time taut until the storm finally arrives, offering a respite from the tension. That nervous, clenched-jaw feeling saturates the beguiling Statik, Darren Cunningham’s latest album as Actress. It’s a soft and unsettling record, quietly off-gassing its paranoid aura like a decaying piece of fruit in a well-appointed kitchen. Even the album’s most beautiful passages—and there are many—move with an anxious slink, as if Cunningham had composed these tracks while hunched over, eyes darting, his shoulders brushing his ears. The majority of Statik came from an unbroken period of productivity Cunningham describes as an “extensive flow state,” and that deep focus gives it a cohesion that some of his previous records lacked. Each song seems to grow out of the preceding one, like a coral reef blossoming into a strange and singular world. Cunningham conceals most of his sounds beneath a blanket of hiss, smudging everything into a blurry haze. He’ll often use sidechain compression to carve out kick drums, giving them the effect of railroad signals strobing on a foggy night. There’s a pervasive dreamlike atmosphere, as if each instrument is being played in a different space, all traveling significant distances to arrive in your headphones. The initial ambient moments of “System Verse” glimmer like light pollution on the horizon, wispy synth pads floating around a murky bass rhythm. As the song fades in, it feels as though it’s slowly—almost menacingly—approaching, coalescing into a muted but propulsive 140 BPM techno track. It can be difficult to compute exactly what’s happening at any given time on Statik, even if the elements are generally familiar. A disorienting amount of tension yields very little resolution. The squirming synthesizer sequences in “Ray” overlap but never seem to touch each other, their circular standoff egged on by the insistent click of 16th-note hi-hats. “Cafe del Mars” features a delirious cascade of arpeggios accented by a string synth, building anticipation for a chord change that never comes. When Cunningham does offer a break from the pressure, he tends to bury it deep in the mix. The gentle flanged guitar melody on “Dolphin Spray” softens the song’s staccato edge, but you have to strain to make it out. Any moments of serenity are fleeting, at constant risk of being overshadowed by the looming dread. “Rainlines” is the least nebulous track on Statik, and perhaps its easiest entry point. On the first listen, it plays like a slightly loopy, potentially improvised jam, chugging pleasantly in place. But lean closer and you’ll discover how jittery and unstable it is. The percussion moves around the kick drum like modal jazz, clav and open hi-hat occasionally switching places in the pattern, creating the illusion of a shifting rhythmic center. The loop gains and sheds harmonic intervals, tricking us into thinking the song’s key is constantly modulating. Near the end, the kick, hi-hat, and clap lock into place, forming a smooth house groove—only to collapse seconds later. It’d be maddening if it didn’t sound so good. That’s the surreal magic of Statik: pallid terror deceptively wrapped in an inviting soft-focus glow. If it’s not Cunningham’s best work, it may be his most quintessential, a true distillation of his ability to simultaneously attract and repulse. This is music born of the era where meditation guidance is paywalled and basic necessities are locked behind plexiglass; where resource-consuming AI recommends a daily diet of rocks; where successive photos on social media might show the brutal aftermath of a bombing and a bottomless mimosa brunch. Statik is the soundtrack to a seemingly endless moment of dread-filled anticipation—something is coming, and we have no choice but to wait until it gets here.

Font,Strange Burden,7.8,Rock,"Thom Waddill, frontman of Austin rock quintet Font, summons his lyrics in semi-conscious fits of instinct. Dream recall and automatic writing; scrawled poems and nonsensical muttering. Waddill seems to live among towers of haphazardly stacked pages—Cormac McCarthy essays and dog-eared Dostoevskys—clipping from them like a scissor-happy kid. The angular, polyrhythmic outbursts from his bandmates are just as reflexive, often built from the drums up during improvisatory practice sessions. On their debut album, Strange Burden, Font fuse grimy post-punk guitar, combustive percussion, and blazing synth riffs, committing roughly three years of evolving live sets to tape. They lose nothing in the process. Strange Burden is meticulous and crackling—a concise, gripping record that sparks and sizzles like a kinked spike of lightning. Font is populated by multi-taskers; most members dart between strings, synthesizer, or a sampling pad at any given moment. During gigs, bassist Roman Parnell and guitarist Anthony Laurence swap machinery with Waddill at the front of the stage, while Font’s two drummers, Jack Owens and Logan Wagner, dish out dueling rhythms in the back. Wagner stands while performing, and of course, also plays a sampler. This kind of dexterity only aids Font’s teeming arrangements, which dissect and reanimate a pile of hyphenated genres. But trying to identify Font’s music is a slippery business; post-punk, art-rock, dance-punk, noise-pop…they are all accurate but insufficient descriptors. Font have been pretty up front about their influences: Talking Heads, LCD Soundsystem, and Radiohead have all been name-checked. But they are also channeling the warped disco of Ian Dury and the Blockheads, James Chance’s agit-jazz, and prog fuckery à la Squid and Black Midi. Font’s earliest singles are stirring and pushy. “Sentence I” is a twisted punk sermon spurred by Parnell’s elastic bass licks and Wagner’s thwacked cowbell. On “It,” Waddill contorts his voice between breathy yelps and ragged shouts, as Laurence’s guitar screeches like a circular saw gnawing through steel. The song is an early instance of Waddill’s absurdist humor: It comes through the bodyIt opens the doorIt crawls up my leg while my mom’s at the storeIt insults my dadIt calls out for GodIt suns on the deck with abandon This faceless “It” is at first menacing, suggesting some kind of hostile, inhuman species. But the sudden swerve into a grocery store, and then a porch chair where “It” tans “with abandon,” feel like cockeyed portraits of the mundane. Most of Font’s songs modulate tension in this way, and Waddill is keen to conjure hyper-specific, mismatched visuals—as if he’s playing a solo round of Exquisite Corpse. Waddill is fascinated with surreal and precise imagery, but many of his lyrics celebrate the pure musicality of words. On “The Golden Calf,” which lurches from downtempo ’90s alt to throbbing industrial, he sings of “breastlike curtains sagging burdens earthbound,” “fingering velour handbags,” and “asbestos in the narthex.” He has an innate grasp of poetic language. Slant rhymes and clashing consonants seem to spill out of him without sounding overworked. He manipulates his voice with similar ease—it can sound as taut and clean as platinum thread, or frayed like the edges of a wind-battered flier. Clocking in under 30 minutes, Strange Burden is perfectly paced and sequenced, maintaining its charge as Font adjust their intensity. Amid the jittery beats and processed grit is “Looking At Engines,” a sneaky power ballad that could be sold to the 1975. Just picture the irreverent Matty Healy belting the song’s funniest line: “Your father eating peach pits like they were smaller peaches/He’s never seen the snow and I don’t think he knows what teal is.” It’s another taste of Waddill’s potent brevity. We have a small amount of strange information, but can easily inspect the character’s pores and fingernails. But the crown jewel of Strange Burden is lead single “Hey Kekulé,” with its pulsing disco keys and crossfire percussion. Waddill penned the lyrics after reading Cormac McCarthy’s essay on the German chemist August Kekulé, who discovered the ring-shaped molecular structure of the chemical benzene when he dreamt of a snake eating its own tail. McCarthy’s piece examines the subconscious and its pesky habit of communicating in cryptic symbols. But Font flourish in this murky realm, and they are thrilled to receive all of the odd creatures that crawl out of it.",0,"July 31, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/font-strange-burden/
Tinashe,Quantum Baby,7.9,Pop/R&B,"To put it in terms quantum physicist Erwin Schrödinger might understand, Tinashe has both finally arrived and has always been here. Over the last few albums, the singer-songwriter has transformed herself into an autodidact of production, mixing, and general perseverance outside of the major label system. Tinashe hasn’t courted a mainstream audience in years, instead cultivating a broad artistic vision and an IYKYK ethos that made her an outlier in an industry obsessed with conformity. Rocket-launched by the summer takeover of “Nasty,” a lip-biting, hip gyrating, flirty-wink of a song that activated nerves at both ends of the spine—everyone’s a freak for something, be it sex toys or anti-colonialist literature—her elastic seventh album is a cool-girl marker for those drawn to the California bombshell’s malleable, kinetic sound. Quantum Baby is a lean and muscular eight-song accompaniment to 2023’s BB/Ang3l that asserts itself with the insistence of manicured nails tapping on a hard surface: There are things to do and people to flip off. Opener “No Simulation” is a slinky almost-ballad that quickly announces itself as Brandy-inspired, courtesy of Tinashe’s dynamic vocal stacking. “These days I wanna feel it, no simulation/It’s gotta be true,” she croons. It sounds like she’s looking for real love—but then again, Tinashe is a comedic and peculiar storyteller (her one-liners in Two and a Half Men always landed), and when she pledges “to go deeper,” she might be giving more explicit directions. “Getting No Sleep” is a windows-down, stereo-blasting song. Tinashe has confessed to working on her music while behind the wheel and it’s easy to envision her driving around LA with this sweetly erotic hit on repeat, getting a feel for how it accelerates and fades away. It’s for the club and the road, aided by a persistent bassline and skillfully placed rhythmic loops that deftly slide into the killer “Thirsty.” Even as her vocals are surrounded by hi-hats and synths, dripping in innuendo, they sound stripped and naked. She’s assured and capable, hovering in a fluttering register: “Don’t play, don’t hurt me/Tryna make you so thirsty/I know that you want me in the worst way/Do it like it’s my birthday.” It helps that Tinashe makes being thirsty look cool, never desperate. Everyone is hooking up, and the singer wants the fiending to be confident and clear, the cosmic opposite of a low-effort “hey” in the DMs. She continues the pleasure quest on “When I Get You Alone,” making noticeable callbacks to Janet Jackson’s “I Get Lonely”: Both songs are committed to the beat drop and the patience love requires. “No Broke Boys” and “Red Flags” touch on intimate disappointments, calibrated to proliferate shady IG captions. The sparse writing sometimes lags as it revisits well-trodden topics—it’s not deep enough to jolt any festering memories. It’s just the tip of what could really be experienced. (A Flo Milli feature could have injected some needed whimsy.) After branching out as an independent artist three albums ago, Tinashe has less and less to prove. Easy as it is to understand the appeal of “Nasty” (it’s “catchy” and “memeable,” Tinashe opined), there’s two reasons that it’s become her first solo Billboard hit and highest charting single since “2 On,” 2014’s turn-up anthem with Schoolboy Q. The first is the very ’20s fortune of hitting the TikTok lottery, which brought her to a bigger audience without having to spend a dime. The second is that “Nasty” just happens to be the platonically great Tinashe song: Easy and exquisite, an evolution without a departure.

Callahan & Witscher,Think Differently,6.3,Experimental,"In F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1936 essay “The Crack-Up,” the writer describes a period in which his mind runs amok; he loses the desire to strive and socialize and withers into a sad-sack cynic. His main source of entertainment is list-making—football players, popular songs, suits he’s worn—and he becomes bitter about the most trivial things. He reflects that once upon a time, before the crack-up, he fancied it “a romantic business to be a successful literary man—you were not ever going to be as famous as a movie star but what note you had was probably longer-lived.” It must feel similar to be an experimental musician, nobly laboring to shatter the boundaries of sound, yet receiving minimal fanfare and being misconstrued by critics. Jack Callahan and Jeff Witscher’s debut joint record, Think Differently, unravels like a musical midlife crisis. It interrogates their careers and the experimental scene but also feels like a long improv sketch, a self-aware simulation of two avant-gardists losing their head and going pop. Call it SoundClown performance art. Think Differently’s hyper-eclectic pulp-rock and quivering Auto-Tune hooks will startle anyone who’s only familiar with their stim-board sound collages. Take Callahan’s Trap Studies, which rewired Zaytoven and Lex Luger shards into what sounds like an isolated FL Studio layer left on loop after the producer fell asleep. Network Glass’ Twitch, released on Witscher’s label, pooled audio from random streams into a frazzled info overload. The closest thing to Think Differently is their surreal 2023 performance “Bring the Flowers to the Theatre,” where they deadpanned on insular themes like review scores and delay effects and punctuated sentences with inane FX. It might be the only performance in history to include jokes about Ridgewood gentrification and also the “BABA BOOEY” groan. The album plays out the same—sardonic and sincere skits about their lives as musicians constantly interrupted by puerile soundbites—but with a new layer of zany alt-rock and trip-hop. Instead of Fitzgerald writing lists of cavalry leaders and football players, the duo assembled a terabytes’ worth of meme effects. They seem to have deliberately chosen the most grating and overused sounds, perhaps to express their dread about the internet and cultural sterility. There’s a Roblox “oof” grunt, the Taco Bell bong, and “ohmaaagawd.” There’s an interpolation of Linkin Park’s “In the End”; one song deploys Masked Wolf’s infamously awful ""Astronaut in the Ocean"" as a riser. The opener is a spoken-word remix of “I miss the old Kanye,” but this time what’s pined for is music with “soul.” It lashes against the “Bandcamp bestowed,” “status quo,” “bar so low” music of today; there are vocals from AI versions of Mr. Krabs and Peter Griffin. Imagine a meme megamix for washed-up Redditors—it’s the kind of album that works best as fodder for Discord debates, not necessarily as a repeat listening experience. Trapped inside the skittering shitposts are gripes and anxieties, mostly confined to the world of experimental music discourse. “Boiler Room” derides the electronic media institution. “Thank you for giving me this wonderful opportunity to… create content for ad revenue,” Callahan croaks in copious voice-correction software, like a constipated Laura Les. It’s often hard to tell if they’re being serious or silly, whether they’re two dudes rediscovering their love of music or going Smash Mouth and “Losing My Edge” mode as a bit. The ambivalence is the point; the album drips with the desire to be dissected, but also wants to be silly enough to frame itself as scallywags goofing off. At the end of “Who Knows Where the Time Goes,” a Cameo they ordered from a TikTok comedian goes: “Oh, you do experimental music? You did the experiment. What’s the outcome? Oh, nobody like y’all stuff, dog. Time to move on.” The tongue is so far in cheek it’s about to poke through. Elsewhere, they seem genuinely depressed about the unsustainable state of touring and the experimental scene. At its best, there’s a kind of doomer catharsis to the way Callahan and Witscher constantly return to the idea of wasted time, wondering if their lives add up to anything more than the sum of their nights spent in clubs and days on the road. The sweet instrumentation helps offset the memes and insidery, like an aural antidote for normies without brainworms. Callahan’s churning, galloping guitar provides the album’s giddy field-trip groove. “Long Drive” rolls and pops with the unwieldy bounce of a monster truck in a cartoon. The grayscale glide of “Participation Trophy” syncs up smoothly with the dry delivery. Ana Roxanne’s ribbon-soft melodies on “Hate the Player” hit like a touch-grass moment. But Callahan and Witscher’s concerns would feel more urgent if the songs actually jolted the brain with wild weirdness, rather than being swathed in a blanket of winky brainrot rock. It’s like British producer Baron Mordant’s stream-of-conscious mocking of left-field music fatuities, but neither texturally haunting nor bitingly witty. At least now the world has a song about loving the grind of creating art, despite it often feeling like a frivolous fool’s errand, that also features reverb Dave Chappelle and the goofy ahh ringtone. They did the experiment. Correction: Network Glass’ 2020 album Twitch was released on Jeff Witscher’s label; it is not Witscher’s own album.",0,"September 18, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/callahan-and-witscher-think-differently/
Bat for Lashes,The Dream of Delphi,7.0,Rock,"Natasha Khan has always treated pop music like it’s spell-casting; her pinches of synth-bass and sprinkles of fantastical lyrics create an unmistakable sparkle. Over nearly 20 years performing as Bat for Lashes, the singer-songwriter has become an expert daydreamer—her last album, 2019’s Lost Girls, was written from the perspective of a female biker gang—and her theatricality has drawn frequent comparisons to Kate Bush. Then, in 2020, Khan had a baby. Her body became impossible to ignore, and its tenderness inspired her latest album. Dedicated to and named after Khan’s daughter, The Dream of Delphi offers several intriguing ambient-adjacent experiments—until its enchantment fades like a half-formed thought. To continue the Kate Bush comparisons, The Dream of Delphi is Khan’s own Aerial. Like that 2005 album, in which a typically enigmatic Bush describes her son as sunshine, The Dream of Delphi sees Khan exchange personal sensuality—the wild horses and weepy kissing of past albums—for more earthly musings. The Dream often sounds like a cut-up version of Khan’s discography, taking her beloved strings, sappy ’80s synths, and seashell drums and slicing them into translucent slugs. The instrumental “Breaking Up” twitches slowly, like many of Khan’s bittersweet pop songs, with an imposing synth-bassline that gurgles like an empty stomach. The harpist Mary Lattimore releases starbursts into the title track, matching Bat for Lashes’ tendency to use strings as a sweetener. Khan sings hypnotically of “milk and opal light.” It’s all pretty, but, in comparison to her more hearty compositions, it’s missing protein. Khan is an efficient maximalist when she allows herself to be, drenching everything with cascading synths—every second should be a waterfall or bust. The impulse to make things bigger translates well to the melody-forward ambient music that makes up most of The Dream, so songs like “The Midwives Have Left” have lovely balloon-like buoyancy. Khan’s fudgy voice thins out as she dips into weightless cooing, nested in piano splinters. These moments are some of the album’s most transportive; they recall the best experimental music about motherhood, like Medulla by Björk. A few of the songs on The Dream of Delphi are a little too underdeveloped and end up dissipating into thin air. But it’s Khan’s lyrics, always so full of gravity and grace, that keep the album from stalling out. “Remember you came from a spiral, unfolding,” Khan sings on “Letter to My Daughter” with the measured insight of motherhood. In this music, motherhood sounds as supernatural as it feels to the people who experience it. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Touché Amoré,Spiral in a Straight Line,7.9,Rock,"Jeremy Bolm is an oversharer. Throughout Touché Amoré’s career, his lyrics have externalized panic attacks and thought spirals, social anxiety and grief, and near-inarticulable existential dread. “I am hard on myself because I’ve been in a band this long and I’m still writing these kinds of songs,” Bolm recently told hardcore legend Norman Brannon’s Anti-Matter. “Is there going to be a listener that’s going to be like, ‘Bro, how have you not fixed this yet?!’” Fear of stagnation is a valid concern. For nearly 20 years, Touché Amoré have mined a rich vein of melodic hardcore, marrying Bolm’s verbal scarification to staccato bursts of violence and sudden swerves toward beauty. Powerful as the formula is, Touché have never been scared to evolve. The band’s watershed 2016 release, Stage Four, represented a purging of Bolm’s emotions following the death of his mother and owed much of its impact to its almost unbearably intimate nature; 2020’s Lament completed the band’s maturation from ’90s screamo pastiche to widescreen post-hardcore. On Spiral in a Straight Line, their excellent sixth record, Touché begin another metamorphosis. Much of Lament contended with the fallout of Stage Four’s release and its effect on Bolm. Though the new album makes reference to earlier themes (“Ten years gone,” he notes on “The Glue”), its songs are discrete vignettes, at times feeling almost like a short story collection. Album opener “Nobody’s” announces the break from previous conceptual conceits: “So let’s grieve in a forward direction,” barks Bolm, his pleas bouncing off a captivating alt-rock groove. Spiral in a Straight Line is an overture of reconciliation to the two wolves inside Touché Amoré: hardcore and indie rock. They take puckish glee in the decision to feature Lou Barlow on “Subversion (Brand New Love)”: Barlow’s trajectory from Deep Wound to Dinosaur Jr to Sebadoh (whose “Brand New Love” he self-interpolates here) is as instructive to Touché’s ethos as any ABC No Rio or Che Cafe regular. The song itself is a clinic—a gloomy, smoldering churn that suddenly becomes one of the album’s biggest barn-burners, replete with serrated guitars and Barlow’s pained howls. The band has lost none of the adventurousness of Lament, but the songs are more direct and immediate, weaponizing Bolm’s hoarse roar in service of the strongest and most surprising hooks of their career to date. The bridge of “Hal Ashby” melds their anthemic bite with the studied whimsy of an Elephant 6 band, all wistful sighs and chiming guitars until it cuts into a deafening scream. The shuddering, swaying chorus of “Altitude” is a high-water mark; when Bolm’s self-lacerating declaration of “I swear there’s nothing new” collides with a mordant waltz, it’s a grimly funny reminder that he’s wrong. As a result of this formal playfulness, Spiral in a Straight Line pulses with revitalized energy and easy chemistry. Drummer Elliot Babin is a Rosetta Stone as the band navigates shifting subgenres, from the riotous din that opens “Disasters” to the pensiveness dominating “The Glue” and “Force of Habit.” Tyler Kirby’s elastic bass work, one of the band’s distinctive features, snaps into focus during the bridge of “Disasters,” laying the groundwork for a classic arpeggio duel between guitarists Clayton Stevens and Nick Steinhardt. An acoustic guitar has become a more-or-less permanent fixture, adding texture to even the most caustic expulsions of hardcore bile. Julien Baker, in her third collaboration with the band, gives an electric performance on “Goodbye for Now,” her ghostly vocals elevating its atmospheric maelstrom into something simultaneously ebullient and melancholic. But no matter how ambitious their musical aspirations, Touché Amoré remain in touch with harrowing emotions: “This Routine”’s ruminations on long-distance relationships and temporal impermanence; the dissociative yearning of “Subversion (Brand New Love)”; the desperate exhaustion of “Mezzanine.” Mental health can never be past-tense “fixed”; it is a never-ending process, of which Touché Amoré’s music is a living document. If Spiral in a Straight Line proves anything, it’s that there is strength in the constant struggle. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Ravyn Lenae,Bird’s Eye,7.8,Pop/R&B,"Ravyn Lenae’s 2022 debut, HYPNOS, established her as a chameleon, adept at blending cushy R&B with her own futurist styles. While this approach placed the 25-year-old singer-songwriter among this generation’s innovators, her follow-up, Bird’s Eye, is a deliberate shift toward a more boundless exploration. For this album, Lenae and executive producer Dahi looked to create something new and formless, pivoting if the music ever felt, as he explained, “too R&B.” While HYPNOS showcased the fluidity of R&B, Bird’s Eye is more varied: Lenae experiments like she’s an alchemist in an R&D lab, trialing new combinations of downtempo guitar, gentle reggae-pop, and even a stuttering, Brainfeeder-esque beat. On Bird’s Eye, Lenae isn’t abandoning R&B altogether but rather discovering and rediscovering pockets for her evolving emotions. The production spans greasy electro zaps, swirling pop, and taut rock, like on opener ""Genius,” where her signature, sage-scented falsetto pierces through a strutting rhythm that’s like a distant cousin to “Billie Jean.” Lenae sings as if she’s whispering from another lifetime with the gift of perspective, explaining, “Paradise takes a little patience/Give it time.” Her music is contemplative, and Bird’s Eye reflects the slow-going part of her self-discovery journey. She’s still deciphering anxieties around love, grief, and self-doubt, but feeling more unconfined than ever. Realistically, growth happens in increments, with build-ups and setbacks. Along the way, Lenae challenges her partners and her loved ones to join her in pushing past discomfort. On the tough, grungy “Love Me Not,” she attends to her romantic desires, waffling between feelings for an ex (“Oh no, I don’t need you, but I miss you come here”). Its softer counterpart, “Love Is Blind,” floats over a supple drum beat and climactic sitar solo, elevating her voice into a pitch that sounds like a lonely witch casting a spell. On “One Wish,” a warm, lush ballad, she tries to blot out the stains of her father’s absence with clarion reflection: “Called me on my birthday/I thought you’d be on your way,” she sings, her wispy vocals drifting amid woozy strings as she speaks for her 10-year-old self. Childish Gambino steps in as a surrogate, crooning from her father’s perspective in brief Frank Ocean-coded blurts, offering a strange sense of comfort. The song is a gorgeous, tender paean to stolen connections, and her dad didn’t hear it until he filmed his appearance in the music video—a testament to Lenae’s willingness to allow her vulnerability to unfold in real time. Even in the album’s meekest moments (the slightly too slack “From Scratch”), it’s easy to get lost in her expansive soprano. On “Bad Idea,” she swats at a sweet-talker in speedy run-on sentences reminiscent of Bow Wow and Ciara’s “Like You.” Her sleek purrs sync beautifully with Ty Dolla $ign’s assured rasp on “Dream Girl,” like she’s Catwoman creeping through a field of glistening keys. The coy, ’80s-tinged track captures summer weekend-in-the-park bliss with slick, watery strings and guitar licks, while “Candy” pairs her lithe, cackling vocals with a lilting lover’s rock groove. Transitioning from those lighter moments into the deeper introspection of “Pilot,” the album’s penultimate track, Lenae searches for belonging beside a crackling fire, lamenting, “Maybe I’m contagious/The way that I can push anyone away.” These shadows of doubt give the album its quaint, mercurial feel, deepening Lenae’s quest for understanding. Bird’s Eye situates her as a consummate thrill-seeker with limitless curiosity, restricted only by the uncertainties in her own mind.

Future,Mixtape Pluto,7.9,Rap,"For someone whose songs so often focus on the self, Future has always been acutely concerned with audience expectations. While tabloid readers took the tonal pivot from 2014’s poorly received Honest to that fall’s scorched-earth mixtape Monster as a reaction to his breakup with Ciara, Future rapped and spoke frequently in interviews about the rejection he felt after releasing happier, more tender songs. Villainy was the only business model for him, he told me in 2020. “What the fuck,” he lamented, “Y’all don’t want me to be in love?” (Or as he would put it on his victory lap the year after Honest: “Tried to make me a pop star and they made a monster.”) In the decade since that recalibration, he’s released songs that credibly communicate irrepressible joy and staggering pain. But in between those blips, he has often lapsed into autopilot, making indistinguishable songs that sound like demos an aspiring artist might submit to prove he can “rap like Future.” The title of his latest record, Mixtape Pluto, suggests exactly this kind of iterative, reverse-engineered approach to music. That could not be more misleading. The new LP—urgent, kinetic, filled with heartbreaking asides and tiny bursts of melodic ingenuity—is Future’s best and strangest since 2017’s HNDRXX. Where that album played like a batch of songs that had been crafted for pop artists, then reclaimed by the auteur and muddied up, Mixtape Pluto seems to grind every cliche and caricature sketch of Future into pulp, then mold it into something odder, more alien, more jagged and delightfully misshapen. It helps that this is the tightest and most engaged Future’s verses have been in some time. (We Still Don’t Trust You, the R&B-leaning half of his split double-LP with Metro Boomin earlier this year, has already become underrated, but is driven far more by Future’s vocal performance.) Since HNDRXX, many Future verses have sounded like the product of long, essentially aimless freestyles that have been spliced into 16-bar verses with varying degrees of care. By contrast, every passage on Mixtape Pluto is purposeful. The way the tension-release cycles play out in smaller and smaller concentric circles through the verses on “Ski” has fine-watch precision, as do the stretches on the opener “Teflon Don” that are meant to be purely percussive. When he slips into slow, languid flows, as he does on “Lil Demon” and “Plutoski,” the writing is laid bare—and is revealed, virtually without exception, as incisive and sometimes shockingly self-critical. Future’s made a career rapping about addiction, both from its throes and in its wake. And still, the plain address of an opioid relapse on “Lost my Dog” is difficult to listen to without wincing, as is his elegy for a friend: “Started to take advantage of these pills when he drill/I want to tell him, Stop,’ but it help him when he kill.” The beats on Mixtape Pluto (led by Southside and Wheezy, though numerous tracks have two or more co-producers) offer a new way forward for Future by tying together disparate threads from his early career. “South of France” is the clearest example of this: a wistful but anvil-heavy missive that locates the intersection of “Bugatti” and “U.O.E.N.O.,” marrying 808 Mafia-style maximalism to the slyer, woozier style that competed with it for airtime in the early 2010s. “Ocean” is private dread blown up to Gothic dimensions; “Made My Hoe Faint” reimagines ratchet music from L.A. and Louisiana in the syntax of contemporary East Coast club rap; “Ready to Cook Up” is built around a sound that could be best described as hand bells from a Christmas Eve mass mediated by a corrupted copy of FL Studio. The bulk of the songs here feature a slew of seemingly discordant elements—but isolated in short bursts, one or two at a time, so that they feel dizzying and hand-stitched, but never cluttered. The central metaphor of “Surfing a Tsunami” is the sort of thing Future has been toying with since before Pluto made him a star: the ocean as a measure of emotional depth and environmental chaos beyond his control. But with the exception of “Lost My Dog,” there are no telegraphed moments of reflection on Mixtape Pluto. Instead, they come as intrusive thoughts, rafts in the flood of jewels and increasingly meaningless sex. It’s an album that argues the only way to confront painful memories is by burying them under new styles. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

O.,WeirdOs,7.3,Rock,"After cutting their teeth playing around London, saxophonist Joe Henwood and drummer Tash Keary linked up to jam during pandemic lockdowns. As gigs returned, O. became an official duo, taking up residence at Windmill Brixton—the South London venue now famous as the incubator for acts like Shame, Squid, black midi, and Black Country, New Road. They caught the ear of Dan Carey, the prolific producer linked to almost everyone in the current UK post-punk boom, and recorded the charmingly titled WeirdOs for his Speedy Wunderground label. But if “post-punk” quickly became a reductive umbrella for the host of adventurous bands percolating in South London, O. represent a particularly arcane new subplot. While Henwood and Keary came up in London’s equally vibrant and of-the-moment jazz scene, O. are not jazz. They aren’t any one thing, but a collision of Henwood and Keary’s disparate interests, name-checking everything from dub to Deftones, noise to A Tribe Called Quest. The two boast jazz technicality, but perform with the viscerality of punk and metal, while favoring textures and colors more akin to bug-eyed electronic music. Their style is muscular, high intensity, and a little gonzo. Keary’s drumming is typically furious yet precise, Henwood’s baritone sax riffs heaving and monolithic. This was the energy that producer Carey sought to capture: WeirdOs was cut live to tape in two weeks, seeking to replicate the urgency of O.’s gigs. Everything in O. is about mutation as the duo chase freeform ideas far into the ether. Much of this experimentation is achieved by Henwood’s extensive manipulation of his sax, filtered through an array of effects pedals. On penultimate standout “Sugarfish,” you can feel the bodily heft in his distorted lead, before it turns into something more closely resembling aqueous synths, only to resurface sounding almost like a guitar. O. pull off similar tricks across WeirdOs. “Micro” sounds like a smeared electronic track, melting Keary’s jungle breakbeats and Henwood’s sax nearly beyond recognition. O.’s fascination with metal shines through in the foreboding rhythms of “Cosmo” and “Slap Juice.” On “Whammy,” Keary switches from blitzkrieg propulsion to suggestive tumbles, Henwood from the natural guttural strength of the bari to more otherworldly and sinuous lines, before the whole thing erupts again in its final act. While hooks abound, WeirdOs also plays as one big, roiling piece. Like the live jams from which it emerged, the album has peaks and valleys, passages of unrelenting intensity followed by space-out cooldowns that offer the slightest moment to breathe. Those with jazz predilections might hear it as a violent deconstruction of the genre, while followers of London’s rock scene might perceive O. as the most eccentric wanderers to yet grace the Windmill’s stage. No matter how WeirdsOs reveals itself to you, O.’s debut is a testament to Keary and Henwood’s fearlessness and dexterity. They take the limitations of two players and two common instruments, and tell the story in a way never heard before.",0,"June 24, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/o-weirdos/
¥$,VULTURES 2,4.6,Rap,"VULTURES 2 opens with a staggering wall of sound that resembles THX’s Deep Note. Dr. Dre’s 2001 famously opens with the same sonic logo, using it to establish the cinematic scope of the album’s slick, muscular G-funk. “Everything you hear is planned. It’s a movie,” Dre told The New York Times in 1999. With its exquisitely arranged melodies and drums, 2001 was immersive and detailed, like cruising through Southern California in the Discovery One. Listening to VULTURES 2, the sequel to Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s surprisingly coherent collab from February, is more akin to being imprisoned inside an Akademiks livestream. There is little noteworthy or thrilling happening in this strange, inert environment, despite the constant provocations and snippets of intrigue. This isn’t surprising. Ye, who once said he got his “entire sound” from “Xxplosive,” hasn’t really focused on music for the past eight years. Though his army of collaborators occasionally uses his extensive resources to stitch together a distinct beat or galvanize say, Playboi Carti or Jay Electronica, to black out, Ye mostly uses songs to soundtrack his live events, be they fashion shows or listening sessions at stadiums. From the Madison Square Garden release party for The Life of Pablo to his Sunday Service series to the Donda shows, he’s increasingly oriented his work toward eyes rather than ears, a mode that favors diehard believers over discerning listeners. At this point, Ye is more of a ceremonial figurehead than a conductor. VULTURES 2 acknowledges this diminished role, making it a sequel in the most modern Hollywood of ways. Were you partial to that swaggering Carti verse on “Carnival?” He’s back for “Field Trip.” Speaking of “Carnival,” those lurching stadium chants were pretty neat, yeah? “Fried” has you covered. Were you fond of the “Whip My Hair”-core kids bop of North West on “Talking?” She returns on “Bomb,” repeating Japanese greetings ad nauseam alongside her sister Chicago West. Do you miss the “old Kanye?” Peep the “Good Life” reference on “Promotion.” These two aren’t using songs to express themselves or explore sounds and themes; they’re more keen to prove they’re impervious to shame. “They tried to hit me with the cyanide/Nice try,” Ye taunts on “Slide.” In its best moments, VULTURES 1 treated Ye like a lame duck. Although Ye’s rapping on VULTURES 1 was notably smoother compared to the poopy-di-scoop of his post-Pablo output, the songs seemed to consciously work around Ye’s deflated performances and edgelord antics, often keeping him—Cash Money-style—away from a given track’s first and last verses. Considering that, a generous reading is that VULTURES 1 was a Ty Dolla album with a Ye-sized budget. But in practice, the Hitler-loving provocateur remained in the middle, ringmaster to the cursed circus. The exhausting show continues on VULTURES 2, which seems to exist because the powers that be just don’t want Ye to win, man. This is the whole album’s shtick: I survived cancel culture, a conspiracy that Ye’s noxious, neverending presence in the spotlight disproves. The sneering sentiment underscores the album’s steadfast lack of purpose. Though the beats are loud and lush, and though guests like Lil Wayne, Lil Durk, and Don Toliver swing through with energized performances, there’s no vision or direction connecting all the moving parts. “Dead” clumsily swings from pounding drums and an energized Future verse to stilted and stupid Ye lines. “Twenty the new 30, but you’re still 30,” the 47-year-old raps. “River” opens with spry and funny Young Thug flexes (“Like a dirty butt, I’m having cheese”) then devolves into vague prayers from Ye. “Too much hate and not enough love/Free Larry, free Young Thug,” he croons mechanically. Elsewhere, he squanders the anguished R&B loop of the “Marvins Room” ripoff “530,” stumbling through the last and obviously unfinished verse with, you guessed it, some scoop-diddy-whoops. It feels telling that the misogynistic insults are the clearest lines: “Don’t sa-fah-na-da, I’m new with this/Da-da, na-dana, goi’ through with this/Pa-da-la, fa-na-dan, don’t think this/Can’t fa-fa-na-da for you fake bitch/You don’t really love Ye, go listen to Drake, bitch.” Male grievance and virility are the only things holding Ye and Ty Dolla’s partnership together. VULTURES 2 is even shoddier in construction and execution than its predecessor. This is frat rap for bitter baby daddies and aspiring trad husbands—kings, I guess. Andrew Tate probably loves it. I’m not sure how anybody else could. No adrenaline, dopamine, or blood courses through this carrion of an album. Despite the frequent overtures to grandeur, spectacle, and machismo, these songs are limp and flabby. No one seems to have wondered why someone would want to play these songs beyond the names attached to them, or attempted to make them more than sonic merch. Ye must really miss the Gap.",0,"August 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kanye-west-ty-dolla-sign-vultures-2/
James Devane,Searching,7.7,Electronic / Experimental,"In the 14 years between his first and second solo albums, James Devane completely retooled both his sound and the methods he used to achive it. Where 2008’s s/t built up swirling drones from looped guitar, his 2022 follow-up, Beauty Is Useless paired dense, soupy synth strokes with techno’s taut rhythms. With the much swifter sequel Searching, it’s starting to look like Devane makes a habit of reinventing his approach on every release. Exactly how he made the music is unclear; the label vaguely notes hours of source material (presumably the artist’s own) run through custom software, and fashioned into tracks that play fast and loose with musical key, tempo, and rhythm. All that complexity appears to lie beneath an unusually simple interface: in Devane’s words, “a search button and a save button.” When an artist hands the reins to software—hardly an unusual practice in 2024—it’s not always clear where the technology ends and human creativity begins. Yet similarities between Beauty Is Useless and Searching—which Devane frames as a companion piece to its predecessor—help locate the person within the process. On both records, a smoky, clandestine quality clings to the synths and murky rhythmic elements, recalling gloaming air that permeates the work of Kassem Mosse and other artists on Germany’s Workshop label. If Beauty Is Useless was largely guided by an even-tempered 4/4 pulse, Searching jettisons that framework in favor of a much more disruptive listening experience. The more fully formed tracks have a meandering, structureless quality interrupted by abrupt endings and brief sketches —alarming 10-second blasts of noise that sound like the digital equivalent of scrubbing through recorded tape as quickly as possible. It’s a playful analogy that foregrounds Devane’s conceptual process, with its apparent emphasis on cycling through found sounds. Even in the cyclical ambiguity of techno, a lack of formal structure can be risky, and Devane leans into the chaos. On Searching, crispy percussive sequences play against each other in mismatched time signatures, yielding a kind of mutant funk. Yet the forced looping of these contrary musical elements—especially noticeable on ""One Place”—harness even the most disjointed rhythms into surprisingly fluid grooves. Aided by the woozy comfort of the machine-soul synth blooms, stubborn loops are seductive, in their own weird way, even without the comfort of a conventional toe-tapping pulse or journeying narrative. The jarring effect of the rhythmic disturbances has its own charm, but the more stable moments on the record are easier to sink into. The mesmerizing melancholy of “No More No Less” recalls the yearning, misty-eyed quality of Actress’ breakthrough albums; similarities with Darren Cunningham’s off-center vision of techno abound in Devane’s crooked thump and low-res aliasing. Devane’s slanted approach sits comfortably alongside other curious operators unbound by dancefloor expectations. Austin Cesear’s records from the early 2010s spring to mind, as do Kit Clayton’s charmingly skewed West Coast dub-techno variations from the decade before. In its heavy-lidded, dreamlike atmosphere you might draw a line to the nu-ambient scene around labels like 3XL and West Mineral Ltd., but that crew’s cavalier YouTube-flipping spirit feels distinct from Devane’s intentional, closed-loop practice. What these reference points do share with Searching is an enduring warmth that transcends any odd angles. The tactile lope of electric piano at the center of “Last Strut,” the blown-out tape cascades on “Lights Down Low”—beneath the technology driving the record lies an inescapable emotional intelligence that no piece of software could ever replace.",0,"May 28, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/james-devane-searching/
Oso Oso,Life Till Bones,7.5,Rock,"Oso Oso albums have promised elaborate narratives about chimeric monsters, a travelog of romantic intrigue in a fictional town, great big beaches, and great big blunts. But on Life Till Bones, Jade Lilitri is no longer fleeing from his own reality. “Other people’s stories got me feeling bored,” he sings at the close of his fifth LP. If there was a change in sound to match the change in sentiment, Life Till Bones might be industrial noise or pluggnb instead of the toothsome emo pop that Oso Oso has been perfecting for the better part of a decade. Still, the commitment to a, gasp, darker, more introspective Oso Oso album in mood alone is enough to make Life Till Bones feel like a welcome expansion of the band’s core aesthetic rather than a mere embellishment. Long-time Oso Oso producer Billy Mannino recently proclaimed the VVS brilliance of Jimmy Eat World’s 2004 record Futures as the standard for “big punchy rock records.” Lest anyone think he was tipping his hand, Life Till Bones is a small, punchy rock record, a string of pearly, polished gems. It’s as if Mannino and Lilitri gave themselves a “clarity, not Clarity” mandate to do away with just about everything that doesn’t provide an immediate payoff: overdubs, reverb, synth washes, or anything as blasé as “a second verse” or “bridge.” A single digital handclap during the chorus of “All of My Love” is about as indulgent as things get here. But having the chorus take up over half the song? That’s economical writing. If Life Till Bones lacks something as explosive as “The View” or “Reindeer Games” or “Computer Exploder” within its 29 minutes, Lilitri makes up for it by reinventing himself as a master of efficiency. The experimentation here takes place on a micro level, song structures inverted and streamlined for maximum impact, genre interludes reduced to teasers. The brisk basslines of “The Country Club” and “Skippy” alone reveal Lilitri’s mindset for a “dancier” Oso Oso album, one that means a slight repositioning along the spectrum between The O.C. and Meet Me in the Bathroom, where the jeans are tight and the rhythm section’s even tighter. “That’s What Time Does” pushes that timeline forward, imagining a teenaged Lilitri trying to find middle ground between the Paramore and Phoenix singles on his iPod Nano; the first nü-yacht rock Oso Oso single ends up smooth enough for Rob Thomas’ approval. Lilitri’s sleight of hand is most pronounced on the cheeky album cover, its Guitar Hero skeleton crew at odds with Life Till Bones’ earnest take on mortality. Sore Thumb was transformed by the passing of Lilitri’s cousin and collaborator Tavish Maloney at the age of 24, but only after the fact; the rough edges and demo-like fidelity were kept nearly intact as a tribute to familial joy that Maloney brought to its creation. The latter still weighs heavily on Lilitri: “That was my brother almost a quarter century/And I failed him when I said, ‘Hold on to me,’” he sighs over a scratchy, lo-fi acoustic strum that has become the requisite mid-album break on Oso Oso albums. But rather than respite, “Seesaw” deepens plainly worded pleas for connection that otherwise might have whizzed by on their breezy melodies: “Feel like I stayed too late and you left too young,” “You’d think there's nothing I fear/But now I fear more of the same,” “I got to hit you up and remember you’re not there.” As much as it reshapes the first half of the album, “Seesaw” is a terminus point of mourning. “I don’t care what disaster’s next around the bend,” Liltiri beams on the snappy, Strokes-y “Application,” starting a run of unabashed love songs written by someone who doesn’t immediately trust what love songs have to say but is at least willing to listen. “I can’t fall in love if it’s not with you,” he admits—and as it turns out, other people’s stories have Lilitri feeling bored because “they’re not like yours.” Like the nine songs before it, “Other People’s Stories” meets its modest ambitions: to satisfy, rather than to surprise. It can leave Life Till Bones feeling not quite commensurate with what it actually is: one of the most celebrated songwriters of his scene making a filler-free record entirely about love and death. Taking the long view, signing to a Big Emo Label and working with a Big Emo Producer on Basking in the Glow makes it an outlier for an artist who prefers to shrink from the spotlight. Lilitri nonchalantly revealed the cover, title, and release date of Life Till Bones the day it got mastered; I’d use the word “leaked,” except Oso Oso are back where they were in early 2017, working with Mannino and self-releasing their album as free agents. While Tavish Maloney shapes the content of Life Till Bones, he also feels present in its context, a purge of distraction and clutter that only comes when people confront what truly matters in their life.

Porridge Radio,Clouds in the Sky They Will Always Be There for Me,8.0,Rock,"A certain kind of pain ends up making you feel invincible if you carry it long enough. Dana Margolin howls from that unstable station on “God of Everything Else,” which is not a breakup song so much as it is a hurricane rippling the surface of an open wound. “Don’t need to know where you are/You’ll be hit by a wave of me/I’m the god of everything else/You’re the god of losing me,” she seethes. She’s not just stepping out of a relationship that’s run its course. She’s leveling the whole city to crush the person who blew it. She’s not a scorned lover; she’s a nuclear blast. Clouds in the Sky They Will Always Be There for Me, the fourth album from Margolin’s band Porridge Radio, arrives at the tail end of an exhausting stretch for the UK quartet. Their previous two albums, 2020’s Every Bad and 2022’s Waterslide, Diving Board, Ladder to the Sky, vaulted Porridge Radio to visibility, garnering UK chart placements and nominations for major awards. As many artists must now do to stay solvent and keep momentum, they toured relentlessly throughout 2022. Then, caught in a marketplace that demands more and more from musicians while paying less, they burned out. Margolin went home to heal from fatigue; as she started to recover, she split from her partner, landing in fresh turmoil. Weaving her long-standing poetry practice into her songwriting, she poured those twin vicissitudes into a crop of ferocious new songs. Clouds is the sound of reaching the very end of your rope, then soaking it in oil and setting it on fire. Recorded in rural Somerset with producer Dom Monks, who engineered and co-produced Big Thief’s Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You, Clouds unfurls its delicate arrangements and startling contrasts across a wider space than Porridge Radio has ever played in before. Brushed drums flutter over softly picked guitar on “Pieces of Heaven,” leaving plenty of room for Margolin’s voice to spiral to the ground like a dying leaf. “In a Dream I’m a Painting” begins with the mesmerizing sound of drummer Sam Yardley’s fingers clattering across a typewriter. Trumpets and flugelhorns plume at the center of “Sleeptalker,” which erupts into fanfare from close to bare silence. The album’s quiet hollows give rise to fever pitches of emotional intensity. With “You Will Come Home,” Margolin launches into one of the most incendiary vocal takes she’s ever captured in the studio. “Come home and take care of the mess I’ve made,” she implores of someone she addresses, in true Spencer Krug fashion, only as “Swallow.” She screams herself ragged as the song gallops to a close, her voice burning off all the varnish that once clung to its surface. Across Clouds, Margolin wrestles with the specter of the person she would need to be to glide frictionlessly through the world: an inexhaustible performer, a calm and smiling face, a person with compact and tidy feelings that never overwhelm her or anyone else. On “God of Everything Else,” she envisions this double as a literal second person in one of the album’s most mystifying and powerful images: “Wishing I was somebody else/Begging you to love me back/I watch the way she stands/And the way her hands move/In a fog of you.” Later in the album, she sings, with barbed irony, as if she’s already transformed into this sanguine doppelganger. “Nothing makes me sad now/Everything makes me happy,” she wails on “In a Dream I’m a Painting,” sounding as if she might either start crying or spitting flames. In the embers of all this rage smolders grief: grief for a love that tore itself apart; grief for those dreams of success whose realization did not in fact lead to a happy and balanced life; grief for all the imaginary, idealized people Margolin might have been but could not become. “The hard bits of my heart, they fall into the hole and they tear it apart,” she sings on “A Hole in the Ground.” She refuses placid resolution, refuses to fold her pain neatly away. Hers is a world-making torment: It shatters the real and demands its wayward shards forge themselves into formerly unimaginable shapes.

Johnny Blue Skies,Passage du Desir,8.5,Folk/Country,"Who the fuck is Sturgill Simpson? Folks have been asking that question ever since A Sailor’s Guide to Earth was surprise-nominated for the 2016 Grammy for Album of the Year alongside Beyoncé, Drake, Justin Bieber, and eventual winner Adele. It became a meme for a few months, with Sturgill even selling T-shirts and sporting a new one at Bonnaroo that read, “Who the fuck is asking?” It all seemed like a good joke at the time, maybe even a pointed commentary on how talent goes unrecognized in Nashville, but the question sums up Simpson’s career; nobody has been asking more than the man himself. He posed it repeatedly on his first three albums, which, in retrospect, form a loose trilogy about losing and finding himself—in Nashville (2013’s High Top Mountain), in the cosmos (2014’s Metamodern Sounds in Country Music), and on the high seas (Sailor’s Guide). Since that Grammy nomination, however, Sturgill has become much harder to pin down, for himself and for us. He seemed to get lost in different roles: first the guitar shredder on the 2019 manga soundtrack SOUND & FURY, then the bluegrass auteur on not one but two acoustic albums, and finally an outlaw troubadour on the song cycle The Ballad of Dood & Juanita. After rupturing his vocal cords in 2021, he announced his retirement from touring, then unretired for a short tour earlier this year. But he is still making good on his promise to record no more than five albums of new material, which represent “the traditional Christian narrative of the journey of the human soul.” The bluegrass records don’t count because they’re almost entirely retreads of older songs. And his latest is not technically a Sturgill Simpson album. Credited to Johnny Blue Skies, Passage du Desir is simultaneously two things that seem completely contradictory. It’s the first album Simpson has released under a pseudonym, and it’s also the true follow-up to A Sailor’s Guide to Earth. In addition to ditching his given name, he chucks most of the R&B horns and Bakersfield riffs that punctuate his previous songs in favor of percolating percussion, cosmic string arrangements, and bluesier guitars. This is country music caught between earthiness and spaciness, and it reintroduces him as one of Nashville’s oddest artists, who understands and subverts both the square mainstream and the outlaw fringes of country music. It’s been only three years since Dood & Juanita, but Passage still feels like a comeback. The album opens on the high seas, the same longitude where Sailor’s Guide left off. The Navy enabled him to see the world and find himself, but on “Swamp of Sadness,” the ocean is a place of confusion, peril, and suffering. Passage is wracked with tribulation, full of death and disconnection and dreams of escape. On the yacht-country “Scooter Blues,” ostensibly the album’s most upbeat song, Sturgill fantasizes about leaving Nashville and self-exiling to some unnamed island. The accumulation of details—rhyming “chocolate milk and Eggos” with “steppin’ on Legos,” taking up kickboxing to stay in shape—suggests that this is no idle reverie but a path to freedom: a way to lose one self and gain another. “Gonna hop on my scooter and go down to the store. When people say are you him, I’ll say not anymore.” If his lyrics address various strains of alienation, the music on Passage du Desir engages with all sorts of sounds and styles and scenes. He may be the only major Nashville artist who has Can and Amon Düül in his collection, who hears in ’70s country a kind of avant-garde impulse. Sturgill is at his most cosmic on “Jupiter’s Faerie,” which raises a glass to an old friend who died before they could make amends. The story is bound to Earth, but the music imagines an afterlife in the vacuum of space: a peaceful vision of heaven, at least for seven and a half minutes. On closer “One for the Road,” he indulges some of his shredding but without the aggression and ostentation of SOUND & FURY. That’s fitting for what sounds like a breakup song, especially one where he tries to remain stoic in the face of the pain he’s causing and feeling. All of this heartache is filtered through the persona of Sturgill the Grammy-nominated country artist, as though he can’t quite escape that particular identity. Songs about the glare of the spotlight can risk sounding hermetic at best and whiny at worst, especially when so many deserving artists would love to have their lives changed by a hit album. Wisely, Sturgill plays up alienation over celebrity, which makes these songs more relatable. Essentially, he’s echoing a very different Johnny: Take this job and shove it. Who hasn’t wondered who they are separate from what they do? Who hasn’t dreamed of shedding their responsibilities to play checkers on the beach? You might roll your eyes when Sturgill sings, “That old radio still won’t play me,” on “Who I Am,” especially considering he’s done a lot to ensure they don’t. But generally, for an artist so guarded and so prickly, Passage is focused outward rather than inward. Maybe you’ve noticed that I’m not referring to him here as Johnny Blue Skies. That’s not an act of catty defiance. I’m not dismissing his need to adopt a new name to make this album or get comfortable in his skin again, but there’s more Sturgill on Passage du Desir than there was on his past four full-lengths. So this isn’t his Camille and it likely won’t be his Chris Gaines either. Mr. Blue Skies sounds more like a conduit back to himself, a means of maintaining a consistent identity when the world insists on twisting and contorting him into someone else. “I’ve lost everything I am, even my name,” he laments on “Who I Am.” “They don’t ask you what your name is when you get up to heaven.

Isik Kural,Moon in Gemini,7.1,Experimental,"A few years ago, when Isik Kural was back in his hometown of Istanbul, he dug out a collection of field recordings that he’d made as a teenager. Listening back, he was struck by a revelation: “So loud,” he marveled in an interview. “The city is so loud!” Kural’s music, on the other hand, is hushed in the extreme. Since releasing his debut album, As Flurries, in 2019, the Glasgow-based musician has developed an idiosyncratic style out of nylon-string guitar, synthesizers, field recordings, and whisper-soft singing. On his new album Moon in Gemini, his music is so wispy that it frequently feels as if a strong gust of wind might reduce it to a tangle of threads. The effect Kural conjures here is less like a teeming city than a neighborhood blanketed by a snowstorm—an unusually vivid calm, so still you can hear snowflakes landing in a crinkling heap. Flute wafts atop gently plucked guitar. One-finger piano melodies trickle over Casiotone synth patches. Most songs take place against a backdrop of rustling or birdsong. Fleeting moments of musical déjà vu—Debussy’s “Claire de Lune,” the Velvet Underground’s “Candy Says”—fade into bedtime lullabies. The innocent intimacy of the scene is that of a kid beneath a blanket with a xylophone and a flashlight, quietly humming sing-song refrains. It’s not just the volume of the music that suggests a naptime reverie; Kural’s lyrics often feel clipped from children’s books. His songs are a patchwork of clouds, rain, seafoam, snow, jumping rabbits. Moonbeams slip between eyelashes; seashells, marigolds, and ghosts all turn up in multiple songs. “Pastel blue blooms in between/A single drop and the leaves of the moon,” he murmurs haltingly on “Prelude,” stringing fragmentary images and non-sequiturs into a lilting meditation on metamorphosis. In some places, Kural’s winsome melodies recall Ana Roxanne; elsewhere I’m reminded of Grouper’s patient loops—if her music were made under the influence of faded PBS cartoons from the ’70s. Cynics, doomers, and the terminally hard-headed may be turned off by all this beaming niceness; seen with a suspicious eye, the album’s air of twinkly-eyed naivete—not to mention Kural’s dulcet, preschool-teacher tone—can verge on kitsch or self-parody. “A smile starts from the eyes wider than skies/Speech bubbles embrace jasmines of surprise,” he coos on “Stems of Water”; “A joyful sunlight hides inside a waterfall.” But in some of his instrumentals, things are not as placid as they seem. Loops of violin pool together in “Daywarm Birds,” stirred by trilling flutes; it’s calm but also slightly spooky, with chilly open fifths gesturing toward older, weirder forms of folk music. And peer beneath the pastel surface of Kural’s lyrics, and stranger things are afoot. In “Almost a Ghost,” about a child padding down the stairs, what at first seems merely cutesy (“untied laces/tenderfeet”) turns strange and wild: No one believes what she has seenA stage whisper,A mirrorIn the color of the sea,A future memoryBetween marigolds, almost a ghost! As in many of the best children’s stories—Margaret Wise Brown’s Little Fur Family and Goodnight Moon, Arnold Lobel’s Mouse Soup—there is more here than meets the eye. Beneath the rosy haze of wonderment, bugs scuttle and wraiths make strange mischief. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

St. Vincent,All Born Screaming,7.8,Rock,"Annie Clark says that a performer’s job is to “shock and console.” For years, she was doing much more of the former than the latter. Her first four records—an impeccable run from 2007’s Marry Me through to 2014’s St. Vincent—played on a common trope of the horror genre, the idea that behind every pristine façade lies a world of ugliness, violence, and malcontent. Horror franchises, of course, tend to get stale pretty fast: Once you know the general mode and motive of a killer, they aren’t all that scary. The aesthetic of Clark’s music has stayed relatively consistent but as she’s added more elements in—synths, latex, wigs, outlandish album concepts that don’t necessarily align with the increasingly personal music contained within—it’s begun to feel less potent. All Born Screaming, Clark’s self-produced seventh album, goes for a hard reset on the St. Vincent project, not by going back to the harsh, alien textures of, say, 2011’s Strange Mercy, but by flicking the dial from “shock” to “console.” Musically, it feels like the first St. Vincent album since Marry Me presented without a unifying aesthetic: at various points, Clark incorporates Bond theme melodrama, Steely Dan-style prog, bouncy art pop and lechy industrial rock, making for what is arguably her loosest record, an exhale after years of fitting her songs into increasingly tight restraints. It’s a freedom that carries through to the album’s emotional content. Clark’s records often display warmth and vulnerability in flashes, but All Born Screaming feels thoroughly romantic and highlights bits of beauty amid Clark’s usual lexicon of chaotic, violent imagery. On the dazed dream-pop ballad “The Power’s Out,” she sings about New York as a kind of hell created by its inhabitants; far from a horror story or an indictment, it sounds like a love song. St. Vincent has occasionally let her mask of irony fall on past albums—“Candy Darling” on Daddy’s Home, “Champagne Year” on Strange Mercy, “Happy Birthday, Johnny” on Masseduction—but this feels like an album full of those songs. Even the harsh tracks are born out of empathy; the quivering, volatile “Reckless” is about spiraling out after someone you love dies; “Flea” might be kinda gross, casting love and desire as a form of infestation, but there’s something romantic about that idea, too. Over a beat that recalls the overdriven chug of Nine Inch Nails, Clark sings lyrics that walk a line between devoted and creepy: “Drip you in diamonds/Pour you in cream/You will be mine for eternity.” “Flea” was one of All Born Screaming’s lead singles, along with the sleazy, hammed-up classic rock pastiche “Broken Man.” Their brazen sexuality and thundering riffs hardly represent the album proper, which on the whole is sensitive and introspective. On the surging pop track “Sweetest Fruit,” Clark pays tribute to SOPHIE and other artists who know that “the sweetest fruit is on the limb”; on “So Many Planets,” a glammed-up take on two-tone, she sings of having “to visit so many planets before I find my own” with equal parts exhaustion and wonderment. Clark has long used her music to memorialize individual queer friends and heroes, but this album takes a more general tack; it feels as if she’s looking to both exalt and inspire, a relatively new mode for Clark, but a welcome one. Or maybe that’s a total misread: After the straightforward lyricism of Masseduction and Daddy’s Home—both produced by Jack Antonoff, who is known for asking his collaborators, “What’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you?” as a songwriting prompt—Clark has returned to the relatively oblique, enjoyably puzzling turns of phrase of her early records. Some of these are fairly legible—“I have climbed into open arms that turned into a straight jacket,” she sings on the fidgety new wave track “All Born Screaming,” which borrows a lyrical conceit from the Strange Mercy classic “Cheerleader”—and others confounding (“Hemorrhaging heartthrob with a six-pack of beer/Leaning outside her burned-out window”.) For the most part, though, All Born Screaming feels sanguine. It ends on a repetition of its title phrase, which could, in one light, be an expression of pessimism; on Clark’s most hopeful record to date, it feels like a marker of communal experience—a sweet kind of consolation.

Sideshow ,F.U.N. T.O.Y.,7.6,Rap,"On F.U.N. T.O.Y., the voices surrounding Sideshow—parents, peers, pastors, sidewalk philosophers—appear between the songs like a Greek Chorus of damnation. They offer no hope or encouragement. Instead, they detail the myriad ways Sideshow and his generation are doomed. One such voice opens the record by explaining that “the young people are not gonna make it into heaven,” another issues hyper-specific death threats, and another shruggingly concedes that violence is “in his blood.” Sideshow doesn’t push back on these ideas much. His dead-eyed hustler tales indicate someone who is resigned to his fate. Sideshow has a utilitarian, disarmingly personal writing style, an approach that feels less concerned with theatrics or manipulation of language than blunt force. His verses are collections of starkly composed snapshots, brief scenes of terror or heartache rendered in vocals that suggest Boldy James and Oddisee drained of all color; even when his delivery becomes frenetic, like the paranoid flow he deploys on “Bad Friend,” his voice still moves with a slippery codeine crawl. It gives his songs a hypnotic quality, making it easy to miss brutal passages like “All my life I been stepped on/God put both feet on me/I cried, my cries they get ignored” on initial listens. There’s a thick air of inevitability in Sideshow’s work, the kind of malaise that comes from always—unfortunately—being proven right about the world. In previous albums, Sideshow’s relationship with selling and consuming drugs occupied the margins like a distant stormcloud, affecting the atmosphere without being at the center of it. Here, substances play a more central role as ubiquitous numbing agents needed to get through the day. Lean is his narcotic of choice. “I’m just tryna put a thousand dollars in one styrofoam,” he raps on “How to Kill a Man”,” following up on that thought later in the song: “Only codeine gives me purpose.” In contrast to Sideshow’s deadpan vocals, the beats he chooses are active and skittish, tumbling over themselves like loose truck tires racing down a hill. Popstar Benny’s contributions are full of colorful, pixelated synths zigzagging around plugg drums, while chameleonic Chicago producer Ayochillmannn provides shuffling, futuristic Southern funk. When combined with Sideshow’s droopy intonations, it all has a crackling, circuits-frying energy. It’s tactile; you can almost smell the frayed wiring. “Villain in Your Story (Still UA)” is a particularly harsh toke of a closer. Marc Rivera’s trudging beat is the perfect backdrop for Sideshow’s unblinking honesty (“You ain’t know I’m a fucked up dude?” he raps, less of a question than a sneer). But after 30 minutes of unrelenting darkness, Sideshow changes perspective. During a spoken-word outro, he explains that as a Black person in America, he can’t be depressed. He’s oppressed; there are systems in place designed to keep him trapped under problems engineered to be insurmountable. The bleary drug abuse, the ambient threat of violence, and the voices preaching downfall are part of a purposeful cycle. If everyone and everything around you only speaks prophecies of doom, you might eventually become a doomsayer yourself.",0,"June 17, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sideshow-fun-toy/
Popstar Benny,Oasis,6.8,Rap,"Popstar Benny’s approach to production took root in grade school, when a CD copy of Gorillaz’s Demon Days revealed the power of cross-genre collaboration. “They got every single style,” the Atlanta beatmaker told an interviewer in 2023. “It was crazy to me that it was one guy doing everything.” Benny’s own hyper-stimulating instrumentals—reflecting his love for Pokémon OSTs, late-aughts indie rock, and first-wave trap music—have made him a key figure in Atlanta’s post-plugg underground. But it’s on his full-length producer albums that he goes full Damon Albarn. More than just various-artists compilations, 2023’s University! and its predecessor, Album*, felt like running a Madden franchise on fantasy draft mode, arranging strange lineups of features just for the thrill of hearing MIKE bob and weave through a classic Playboi Carti type beat or getting Duwap Kaine and Bear1boss to go freestyle for freestyle. Benny’s latest collection, Oasis, is uncharacteristically focused, featuring an all-women roster of rappers and vocalists from the Atlanta scene. At just under 20 minutes, it’s one of the leaner entries in his discography, chaining together fragments of psychedelic pop ephemera in close succession. The cover art, a brooding, alien landscape vandalized by a Lisa Frank sticker set, accurately reflects the performances Benny coaxes from his guests, juxtaposing their bratty taunts with nuclear bass thumps and spooky melodies. In Sanrio terms, it’s more Kuromi than My Melody: sinister, but endearingly so. On “Hate Me,” Coco & Clair Clair effortlessly embody this attitude, indexing all the reasons haters might envy them, like sparking a label bidding war or appearing in their boyfriends’ Spotify history. Their deadpan jabs make an appealing contrast with the lush digital strings and zig-zagging sine waves of Benny’s pluggnb orchestration. These strange, occasionally dissonant amalgamations of emotion are a particular strength of Popstar Benny and co. “Charlie’s Angels” is a boilerplate party rocker on the surface, built around Avi Kaior’s nonchalant flexes and Casamigos-fueled invitations to the dancefloor. Benny’s New Jazz-inspired synth leads, though, are primed to induce delirium; the song is equal parts ecstasy and panic, like watching the ceiling spin. “Grow Up,” on the other hand, plays things a bit too safe, weaving airy jazz chords into a skeletal Jersey club beat. It’s pleasant but feels slight compared to the distinct punch of similarly structured songs by Kyle Ricch or Ice Spice. Opener “2020” matches a whispy vocal chop with a similarly ethereal Vayda verse, creating a washed-out effect that’s smothered by a booming 808 kick. Quotables like “They mad that I’m smiling… Don’t wanna see Vay on an ad for Crest” deserve more room to breathe. The best offering on Oasis, however, is its most aggressive outlier. On “Pajamas,” Mercury struts into a downright evil rage beat, kicks up her feet, and rattles off 16 bars with enough confidence to make you believe no other rapper could do the instrumental justice. Her play on traditionally gendered hip-hop tropes (“If I had a dick, it’d be big like a Tonka”) is particularly effective; it’s a dynamic that I wish the full tape had explored further. As a showcase of regional talent, Oasis is a fun hang, but within Benny’s own goofy, surreal world, it’s more like an appetizer.",0,"October 17, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/popstar-benny-oasis/
Dehd,Poetry,7.6,Rock,"Dehd is as much a rock band as they are a viable alternative to Red Bull. The Chicago trio’s previous two—great, but relatively interchangeable—albums, 2020’s Flower of Devotion and 2022’s Blue Skies, established Dehd as something you reach for when you want to feel hypercharged. Singer Emily Kempf’s vocals have the endearing, squealing quality of a hog call, and Jason Balla makes the guitar sound like his strings are fruit-colored rubber bands. Their music offers a reliable path to sun-kissed paradise, if your version necessitates dirty knees and sticky fingers. But on Dehd’s latest album, Poetry, the band tries the backroads. With more ambitious melodies and compositional complexity, Dehd sends a lightning bolt through their already electric sound. All they needed was a binding agent. Balla notes in press materials that he, Kempf, and drummer Eric McGrady approached writing Poetry differently than past albums. They abandoned their typical roles—McGrady exercising his yogic restraint over the drum kit, Kempf spilling her voice all over the mic—in favor of experimentation. Balla recalls how they’d all “bounce around the room playing different instruments, dreaming up different ideas” and summoning the red-hot energy they felt when the band was younger. The result is worthwhile: Poetry still pulses like summer, but Dehd sounds more cohesive than ever. Forest layers of guitar and echoed vocals replace the ponytail swing of Blue Skies. Still, Balla often sings with charming indifference, like he found the lyrics crumpled in his back pocket. “It’s a lover, soft undressing,” he muses with Kempf on the headrush “Dog Days,” only to finish the next line with a statement of apathy: “It’s a, ugh, whatever.” His reedy voice and Kempf’s gunshot shouting have always mixed together well, like sparkling water and soda syrup. But Poetry elevates their natural chemistry with bold harmonies. The two trade light da-da-da’s and lazy ahh’s on the yearning “So Good,” as if they’re playing dentist. When McGrady’s drum starts to rumble, it feels like Earth is parting for the song’s true message: “I’m bad at this love thing/You’ll probably mean nothing.” Dehd tackle the same topics with a missing-tooth grin: addictive love, pain, being a happy outsider in spite of these things. Despite the cringey loftiness that a title like Poetry suggests, they consistently deliver sensible Bob Seger jams, like “Shake,” on which Kempf huffs out big breaths, as if she’s using them to keep herself cool. The poetry is in the mundane, they suggest. It’s in all the disparate pieces that come together to form one mosaic, your one life. That sense of quotidian beauty is especially palpable on “Pure Gold,” in which McGrady’s drums sway like blossoms in a windy wildflower field. Kempf and Balla chant triumphantly, proclaiming that it’s all “Easy, breezy/Ooh, yeah/We laugh so freely.” Their instruments no longer rub against each other like dry sticks, as they would on past albums—instead, they melt together like popsicles.

Cold Gawd,I’ll Drown on This Earth,7.0,Rock,"Cold Gawd have often dreamed of escape. The Southern California band’s singer and primary songwriter, Matthew Wainwright, has said that his lyrics on their 2022 album God Get Me the Fuck Out of Here came from a place of intense existential discomfort—that after a lifetime of ignoring his issues with himself and the world around him, he felt trapped in “bad habits and old ways of thinking.” Desperation haunts the record’s dense thickets of nervy distortion and anguished whispers; it’s right there in the title’s prayer for deliverance. They wanted out at any cost. I’ll Drown on This Earth, the band’s second full-length, opens with a scream that suggests the intervening years haven’t been much easier. Pained and phlegmatic, the opening moments of “Gorgeous” give way to a static-scoured ballad of what-ifs and could’ve-beens, with Wainwright murmuring about being born again into a better life that feels just out of reach. It only becomes more intense over the five and a half minutes that ensue, roiling and swelling into a crushing climax that recalls the stormy post-metal catharsis of bands like Envy and Deafheaven. Sickly, overwhelming, and downcast, this is familiar territory for Cold Gawd, but it’s also one of only a few songs that hew so closely to the sludge-splashed shoegaze they’ve become known for over the past few years. They’ve often expressed feeling hemmed in by the genre—as one of their T-shirts memorably puts it: “Shoegaze is a prison.” And while I’ll Drown on This Earth does use tracks like “Gorgeous” to demonstrate their intimate knowledge of the sound’s grand scale and gloomy sonics, they’re also clearly eager to push beyond it. Wainwright has said he intended this record to be more than just “another ‘woe is me’ sort of thing.” Instead, he wrote of tenderness and intimacy, the dawning of new desire, and the mutual dependence that blooms out of lasting love. Though the scuzzy murk of Cold Gawd’s older songs is still present, it’s illuminated by a newfound serenity in the smeary synth pads of ““Nudism”” and other similarly contemplative songs. As Wainwright sings of a figure that visits him only in dreams, the track burbles and laps in a way that feels pensive and surreal, a rare quiet moment for a troubled mind. “Tappan” is similarly reflective; the sleepwalking, loop-laden ballad recalls the tape-melted haze of Toro y Moi’s earliest experiments more than it does any of the punkish brutalism that informed their foundational work. Guitars stutter nervously underneath washes of spectral ambiance, distinct parts blurring together in foggy bokeh. Amid the fog, Wainwright whispers a vision of love: “I saw heaven in instances of you.” The moment stands in stark contrast to the grayscale bleakness of Cold Gawd’s catalog. Until I’ll Drown on This Earth, the beauty of Cold Gawd’s songs had often lay entirely in their instability and intensity. Amid a crowd of young artists fascinated by the often pillowy sounds of shoegaze, they stood out because their songs felt uniquely pessimistic and pained. But this time, Wainwright has found that there’s value in pausing, taking a breath, and letting some light in. If nothing else, it lends new depth to the darkness.

Billy Strings,Highway Prayers,7.8,Folk/Country,"Highway Prayers, the major-label studio debut from Billy Strings, is a coming out party for the bluegrass wunderkind. Not that Strings necessarily needs an introduction. Over years of touring punctuated by a handful of acclaimed records on the legendary Americana imprint Rounder, the Michigan native has developed a quicksilver style that has earned him widespread appeal and industry recognition: Home, his second record, won the Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album in 2021, right around the time his fleet flat-picking found an enthusiastic reception among jam band freaks. Without ever abandoning his roots in traditional bluegrass, Strings ventured into other musical styles, demonstrating his facility with rock, metal, and blues, sounding equally at ease with bluegrass legends Béla Fleck and David Grisman as he is with rapper Post Malone or jam titans Phish. Strings didn’t extend invitations to high-profile guests to appear on Highway Prayers, although he did choose to enlist one prominent collaborator: producer Jon Brion, whose extensive resume includes classics by Fiona Apple and Kanye West, along with ornate film scores for Paul Thomas Anderson. Brion’s expertise lies in using the studio as a canvas, a skill he imparts in subtle ways to Strings, who adds painterly nuance to his bluegrass. The expanded palette, along with the record’s rambling double-album length, reflects a musician who is happy to experiment—but the key to the success of Highway Prayers is that he never roams too far from home. The picturesque detours are crucial to the album’s character, though. Brion brings sly studio wizardry to Highway Prayers, looping bong rips and ignited lighters for the rhythm track of “MORBUD4ME” for a stoner joke that’s subtle enough to slip underneath the radar of a less discerning listener. A similar trick is pulled on “Leadfoot,” where the pair samples a vintage Chevy, its growl subsumed into a charging getaway anthem. Only a handful of tracks were recorded in Los Angeles with Brion at the board, yet his guidance and occasional instrumental contributions lend the record sweetness and a subtle sense of cinematic scope. “Gild the Lily” glides by like a sweet summer breeze, while the jailhouse tale of “Seven Weeks in County” has its plight undergirded by ghostly strings wailing in the background. Strings’ time in the studio with Brion inspired the guitarist to head to his home turf to construct “Stratosphere Blues/I Believe In You,” a mini-suite where echoey vocals and keyboards combine into a pulsating astral lava lamp that then gives way to an aching, direct plea for connection. This duality captures the album’s aesthetic in miniature: All of his external explorations drove Strings to turn inward, to apply what he’s learned to bluegrass, the music he loves most. Earlier this year, Strings released Live Vol. 1, a collection of concert highlights that emphasized the outer limits of his onstage jamming. Compared to that release, Highway Prayers can seem relatively staid. Where the live compilation teems with flights of fancy spiraling upward, the studio set is proudly anchored in bluegrass, where each shift of mood is accentuated by the lonesome harmonies and dexterous picking of Strings and his regular road band. The decision to augment, not expand, his bluegrass on Highway Prayers helps illustrate his mastery: He’s finding new aural and emotional textures within a familiar genre. Those fresh sounds are married to the sturdiest set of songs Strings has written, with defined melodies distinguished by flashes of empathy and wit. The plaintive lament “My Alice” cuts as lasting an impression as its opposite “Catch and Release,” a clever talking blues where a state trooper pulls over the narrator. As sharp as these songs are, Strings sometimes can still seem most comfortable playing, not singing: “Escanaba” and “Seney Stretch” both carry a sense of understated grace whose beauty lingers long after the album stops playing.  Highway Prayers’ long runtime allows for these moments of quiet reflection to feel as integral to the album as the spirited picking from Strings—an impressive emotional evolution that mirrors the artist’s divergent, yet rooted, musical progression.

Washed Out,Notes From a Quiet Life,6.0,Electronic,"Forgive Ernest Greene his absence; he’s been gettin’ busy living. The Facebook post announcing Notes From a Quiet Life—the fifth Washed Out LP, and first in four years—closed with “welcome to Endymion.” It’s a reference to the 20-acre, Macon-area horse farm he purchased in 2021 and converted into a combination homestead and artists’ estate. The property is central to the album’s promotion: An illustration of a ranch house adorns Sub Pop’s press release, which is mocked up to resemble mid-century letterhead. Last month, Greene posted a short film (also titled Notes From a Quiet Life) about his day-to-day at Endymion: changing diapers in the magic hour, exploring the woods, tending to his mindfully arranged spheres. Washed Out appears as chillwave personified: a Southern-fried bedroom musician, beating an emotional and sonic retreat to the past in the face of an austerity-wracked present. Endymion feels like the future that Greene’s cohort was sold. How curious that none of this made it to the record. Despite the fingerpicking depicted in the film, this isn’t Washed Out’s For Emma, Forever Ago, or even a folktronica turn. This time, he actively avoids musical influences. Visual artists, primarily sculptors, were Greene’s inspiration: Barbara Hepworth, Donald Judd, Henry Moore. Those are the leftfield citations of a noise musician or an ECM jazz composer, and an acknowledgment that Greene, too, is refining his own well-recognized forms. The life may be quiet, but the notes seem cribbed: The easiest way to describe this record is 2020’s Purple Noon with the fog burned off. “A Sign” snaps the dissolute lovers rock of Purple Noon’s “Paralyzed” to the grid. The fluttering, fatalistic closer “Letting Go” is a modal cousin to the Balearic reggae of “Time to Walk Away” (to say nothing of Chris Isaak’s transcendentally simpering “Wicked Game”). Where “Reckless Desires” used rhythmic koto figures to remain aloft, “Second Sight” is content to deploy the instrument as a vaporwave glissando. Notes From a Quiet Life is, somewhat surprisingly, the first Washed Out album Greene has produced alone. Perhaps he cleared the haze in order to better reveal the classical structure of his songwriting. The results sound great: punchy snares and widemouth synth bass. And to an unprecedented degree, his voice—a careful baritone that recalls Beck at his most plaintive—occupies a large part of the space. He brings a stateliness to the expected places: the tender “Got Your Back,” with its wordless lullaby of a hook, and the twinkling “Wondrous Life,” which nearly topples into power balladry. But it’s also present on the dissolute lovers rock of “A Sign,” a crush song that generates its heat from overthinking (“But I think I’m falling hard/Am I taking this too far?”) instead of attraction. “Say Goodbye” is a slow strut of a breakup song, so assuring and frictionless it’s like being sent home in a hovercar. All this plain speaking can be a drag after a while. Even at his most ponderous, Beck is still good for an arresting image or turn of phrase. The sincerity of Notes From a Quiet Life has no whimsy to counterbalance it, and none of chillwave’s day-drunk reverb to muffle it. And Greene’s attempt to augment his conversational clichés with narrative heft—accepting OpenAI’s commission of a Sora-generated music video for the pop-rock heartbreak of lead single “The Hardest Part”—was a grisly stumble, a shortcut to dream logic from the figurehead of a genre that plays effortlessly with nostalgia and memory. In the mini-doc, Greene talks about the grind of touring for a musician now in his forties, and his attempts to take better care of his body. With that in mind, you could read this album as a purgative act: a rejection of quick-hit stimuli (narcotic synths, Stones Throw-style beatmaking, house music) in order to find something sustainable. Maybe it’s in the languid R&B of “Wait on You,” with its choice combination of a pitched-down vocal hook, lovestruck coos, and a restless rhythm guitar. Or perhaps in the elevated ’90s adult contemporary of “Running Away,” in which he holds his vowels so long he’s in danger of a shot-clock violation. Despite its slightness, Notes From a Quiet Life is still a landmark in Washed Out’s catalog: a true solo turn and a complete break from chillwave sonics. But having finally acquired all this space, Greene seems unsure how to fill it. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Total Blue,Total Blue,8.0,Electronic,"Los Angeles’ Nicky Benedek and Alex Talan may not live in the past, but you can bet they have summer houses there. Benedek—who in 2011 cited Zapp and Roger Troutman as influences, making him one of the most clued-in college juniors in the history of higher education—got his start making sleek, ’80s-inspired boogie that sounded like it had been swiped from the cassette deck of a vintage lowrider (another major influence: West Coast G-funk). When he graduated to a broader amalgam of R&B, new age, freestyle, and deep house, Benedek’s music remained steeped in analog warmth and tape hiss. Talan, aka Coolwater, has shown similar crate-digging instincts on his NTS show Cool World West, favoring artists like Joe Zawinul, Bill Laswell, Haruomi Hosono, and also Talan’s late father, a filmmaker and bedroom synth player. Coolwater’s eponymous 2020 debut EP sounds like a distillation of all those influences, a kind of L.A. jazz noir with a Blade Runner soul. In the new trio Total Blue, which includes their friend Anthony Calonico, they dim the lights and deliver an even more enchanting simulacrum of outernational jazz and big-budget new age. The three musicians previously worked together on Coolwater’s EP, which in retrospect looks like a trial run for Total Blue. Their debut album takes similar sounds and influences—fretless bass, muted trumpet, racks of outboard effects—and distills them into a dreamier, more ethereal fusion. “The Path” opens the record on an aquatic scene: A liquid electric bass melody glistens like oily water beneath the docks; a gentle marimba rhythm clinks like rigging against sailboat masts. It’s chromatically lush, a feast of augmented chords and burnished accidentals; halfway through, a keening wind-synthesizer melody carries the song to its logical smooth-jazz conclusion. “Corsair” picks up both the maritime metaphor and the retro sensibility: Everything, from the flanged guitar to the LinnDrum thwacks, seems designed to evoke a specific era and spirit of digitally abetted jazz production. Back in its heyday, this was an expensive sound to create; Total Blue pay tribute to those studio bills of yore with sumptuous chords and arrangements that sound like a million bucks. If you didn’t know the backstory, it would be easy to assume from the album’s glistening sheen that it was a reissue of an ’80s new-age relic. Even the evocative, globe-trotting titles sound like something from a Windham Hill or Private Music laserdisc: “Heart of the World,” “Chaparral,” “Jaguarundi.” It’s not just the sound design that feels opulent; so do the songs themselves, which stretch out with an almost extravagant sense of leisure, bass glissando and ersatz reeds mirroring each other in slow, sensuous motions. No matter how many times I’ve listened, every time the trio pivots to a particularly juicy chord, it feels like triple cherries coming up on the slot machine. Their references are easy to identify. The taut, dubbed-out guitar plucks at the center of “Heart of the World” flash back to the cosmic expanses of Manuel Göttsching; “Jaguarundi” is rooted in the rainforest rhythms of Jon Hassell records like Vernal Equinox; the electroacoustic shimmer that ripples across the album recalls new-age jazz composers like Mark Isham and Patrick O’Hearn. Unlike some record collectors, these three never sound like they’re trying to score cool points; to the contrary, many of their inspirations are artists and sounds that have long been written off by gatekeepers. “Bone Chalk,” one of the album’s highlights, is a dead ringer for the billowing filter sweeps and misty-eyed chord changes of Seal’s “Violet,” the meditative closing song on the adult-contemporary singer’s Trevor Horn-produced debut. Intentional homage or accidental kin? Whatever the case, Total Blue’s bewitching take on ambient jazz is a compelling argument that there’s no such thing as too smooth.",0,"July 25, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/total-blue-total-blue/
Los Campesinos!,All Hell,8.5,Rock,"How does one best measure the Los Campesinos! experience—in years or albums? Sexual humiliations or World Cup disappointments? Pints of lager or mouthfuls of vomit? Whichever you prefer, they’ve come a long way to reach a recognizable form of “maturity.” All Hell, the Welsh band’s seventh album, ends with a solo acoustic guitar, musings on the afterlife, and hushed backup vocals that make it kinda sound like a late-period Blur song. True to form, it’s also called “Adult Acne Stigmata.” If the embarrassments of adolescence have become badges of honor in adulthood, well…there’s probably a Los Campesinos! album to which you have an unhealthy attachment, so I won’t dishonor that by calling All Hell their best. But it is unquestionably the ultimate Los Campesinos! album. Self-referential, self-funded, self-managed, self-released, and self-produced, All Hell is a triumphant validation for the coalition Los Campesinos! have amassed in two decades of wandering the margins: emo-curious indie adults, indie-curious emo kids, DIY scenesters and Genius annotators, avid consumers of hard cider and hard-left politics, obsessives of European football and American Football alike. To call All Hell a form of fan service is hardly a slight, since that’s been the entire point of Los Campesinos! from their very beginning—from their early zines to the “Blood Pact” badge to the “Doomed” football jerseys to their listening party bingo cards or even just the socialist leanings inherent in their name. Throughout their new record, Gareth David pledges allegiance to Hunt sabs and ACABs, secular girls with Catholic guilt, backbreakers of the spineless, cheapskates with costly words. Conversely, the ever-present “them” in positions of authority are anonymous and off-screen, interested solely in protecting their power. “Tell me how many hours in any single dull day/Can I pray to a league table but still it don’t change?” he sneers on “Long Throes,” a perfect expression of the existential dread that comes after years believing that outcomes in politics, sports, or the supernatural could actually be changed by the average person. Maybe there’s a German word that captures this feeling, but until then, Gareth does his best with a series of truly one-of-one metaphors. As ever, the dizzying array of football, video game, and wrestling references illuminate rather than obscure the syllabus of “adult friendship…drinking for fun and drinking for misery…the heart as an organ and as a burden…climate apocalypse.” The grim jest of life is a “cavalcade through antemortem, terminal suburban boredom,” ground-level organizing is “pooling pennies for the coin-op guillotine”; lust is rendered as familiar greed (“You’re a million bucks and I am avarice”), whereas the climate apocalypse might come before finding true love (“You and me, antipodes/The Earth’s collapse, we finally meet”). At this point, Los Campesinos! aren’t trying to sway critics who found them too wordy, too effusive, or just plain too much. The band wasn’t writing songs as streamlined and propulsive as “Moonstruck” in their early, bad-diary days, even if the chorus still rests on the word “selenograph.” “Feast of Tongues” builds towards the first true Los Campesinos! lighter-waver, the only lovers left alive survive on “the tongues of the last bootlickers.” But All Hell expands their sound and vision, welcoming diehards who’ll recognize the callbacks to “I Broke Up in Amarante” or any of the “Heart Swells” medleys, casual listeners who crammed “You! Me! Dancing!” into all of their 2007 mix CDs, and the newly converted teens whose parents need explainers of how to act at a Los Campesinos! show. “Holy Smoke (2005)” finds LC! back in their spite-spitting, scenery-chewing MySpace voice, when Gareth’s top priorities were getting drunk and getting laid. Now with “no children and no profession, walking dead at 37,” Gareth takes a more considered approach, trying to suss out the generation gap between himself and the future of the left (“They don’t buy the beers I drink/And they don’t drink the beers I buy”). “Clown Blood/Orpheus’ Bobbing Head” is a welcome return to the scabrous post/pop-punk of We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed, with its production enlarged for texture—the better to pick up on the nods to Black Desert Online, Leisure Leagues, and Bundesliga. Every proper song on All Hell honors some past iteration of Los Campesinos! from a more refined perspective, none more so than the one featuring the first Kim Paisey lead vocal in nearly a decade. It’s 18 years of evolution crammed into 156 seconds: the verse is also basically the chorus, Tom Bromley rips off a hotshot solo that would’ve required a session hand on 2008’s Hold On Now, Youngster, the gang vocals sound piped in from a church rather than a pub, and having refrained from barging in over his bandmates for nearly two minutes, Gareth comes in to steal the bridge. But again, if this all sounds like a “mature” version of Los Campesinos!, the song is called “kms” and played for laughs. “kms” sets the tone for All Hell’s remarkable final stretch, one that amplifies the tender mood that Los Campesinos! have taken since they reclassified themselves “the UK’s first and only emo band” upon seeing their influence spread amongst Tumblr power users and maximalist revival bands. “Grind my bones into the finest snow,” Gareth shouts on “0898 HEARTACHE,” a callback to his early tendencies to envision no better outcome for his life than the most gruesome, awesome death. The message soon changes, as he hopes to be “restored to Earth, afforded a second birth,” providing a feast of rotten fruit for years to come. By the end, Los Campesinos! view mortality with more acceptance than resignation. Maybe this is just the inevitable subtext for a band that once put out a new album every year and now does so once every half decade; especially one surely aware of the precarious longevity of any peoples’ movement. So yes, Los Campesinos! are thinking about their legacy at a time when formerly beloved athletes, television shows, and politicians have disappeared up their own ass doing the same. The difference here is that, for all of the “self” that went into making All Hell, it’s all in service of endless generosity and respect for the people who made it possible. After 18 years, the members have finally dropped the Campesinos! surnames, the last thing that distinguished them from their own fans. The astonishing amount of care and detail that went into All Hell might just be the result of seven and a half years of creation, or maybe it’s Los Campesinos! giving us an album big enough to live in case it needs to last a lifetime.",1,"July 19, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/los-campesinos-all-hell/
Chuck Johnson,Sun Glories,7.3,Experimental,"The pedal steel guitar, a staple of country music, is inexorably associated with one of the instrument’s most alluring qualities: its ability, within the confines of a pop song lasting just a few minutes, to conjure the open skies and endless spaces so crucial to the mythology of the American West. If you’re going to claim the pedal steel as your primary instrument, especially in ambient music, you’re faced with the choice either to lean into those associations or resist them. On his new studio album Sun Glories, Chuck Johnson unapologetically chooses the latter. This is the most restless, exploratory album thus far from the Oakland guitarist, who started out on acoustic before giving steel the starring role on 2017’s Balsams. A lot of ambient artists are embracing the pedal steel right now, from the contemplative West Coast duo North Americans to the explicitly countrified SUSS, but none are quite as willing to jettison the instrument’s readymade associations as Johnson. He has more in common with the ambient techno stalwart Polmo Polpo (aka Sandro Perri), who used a lap steel to kick up clouds of shoegaze dust. The range of Johnson’s vision is most apparent on the two absolutely titanic tracks that bookend Sun Glories. “Teleos” at first sounds like nondescript pedalboard soup until it gradually assembles itself into a six-note riff. Then the real surprise: Drummer Ryan Jewell enters with a massive fill, elevating the song into the kind of uplifting post-rock that’s often associated with sports and athletics—recall Explosions in the Sky’s Friday Night Lights soundtrack, the 2010 Olympic ads with the xx’s “Intro,” or countless GoPro videos scored by the amped-up downtempo of Tycho and Ratatat. “Broken Spectre,” which comes at the end, follows a similar structure of beatless rumination followed by the triumphant appearance of Jewell and subsequent fireworks. It’s a good sound for Johnson, not least because it allows him to color so far outside the country box to which steel players are so often confined. The four tracks in between hover at a lower altitude, continuing the almost chamber-music approach of 2021’s The Cinder Grove, in which Johnson used his instrument as a textural bed while organs and strings danced freely at the front of the mix. These are less distinctive, notable mostly for whatever instrument Johnson duets with: a string section on “Ground Wave,” a throbbing organ on “Superior Mirage” that’s suggestive of My Bloody Valentine’s all-build-no-release classic “Is This and Yes.” The best of the tracks in the midsection are “Hovering,” which builds from a textural glint to an overdriven climax so gradually it’s hard to notice, and “Sylvanshine,” on which Johnson switches to a standard electric guitar and pays tribute to the thriving experimental scene in Oakland. It’s inspired by Rachika Nayar, whose Heaven Come Crashing is one of the best recent examples of maximalist, electronics-enhanced post-rock, and it features Oaklander Cole Pulice, who likes to overdub their saxophone and pitch-shift the layers until it sounds, well, a bit like a steel guitar. Johnson’s change of instrument on “Sylvanshine” is barely even noticeable, but that feels like a success in the context of Sun Glories, which is almost impudent in its rejection of anything that would associate Johnson’s music with country music or Western cliché. By melting his instrument down to a wall of shimmering sound, Johnson has created a blank canvas for just about anything. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Lia Kohl,Normal Sounds,7.9,Experimental,"In the summer of 1966, Morton Feldman—a composer known for mournful elegance and minimalist restraint—was feeling kvetchy. In a freeform conversation with John Cage at New York’s WBAI studios, he griped that a recent trip to the beach had been spoiled by the proliferation of transistor radios “blaring out rock’n’roll.” Cage, ever philosophical, was more circumspect. “Well, you know how I adjusted to that problem of the radio in the environment?” he asked his friend and fellow avant-gardist: He simply composed a piece using radios. Now whenever he heard the din of clashing broadcasts in public, he continued, chuckling: “I think, well, they’re just playing my piece.” The Chicago cellist and composer Lia Kohl cited Cage and Feldman’s conversation in a recent interview, with good reason: Her music represents a similar rapprochement with the racket of everyday life. On her 2023 album The Ceiling Reposes, she lifted snippets from the airwaves—drive-time chatter, weather forecasts, stock-market reports—to use as accidental counterpoints to contemplative cello improvisations and atmospheric synth sketches. She goes further on Normal Sounds, extending her net to catch all manner of noises (buzzing fridges, tinkling ice-cream trucks, honking car horns) that she mixes into a richly tonal, patiently melodic electroacoustic blend. There’s plenty of precedent for this kind of quotidian found sound, particularly in electronic music. The late Peter Rehberg, collaborating with Vienna’s General Magic, placed contact mics on a refrigerator to create 1995’s winking Fridge Trax. Matthew Herbert turned to kitchen utensils and toothbrushes on 1998’s Around the House; Matmos sourced every note on 2016’s Ultimate Care II out of a Whirlpool washing machine. But Kohl—who calls her album “a love letter to the mundane sonic world, to the part of my brain that just can’t stop listening to everything, all the time”—takes a different approach from her predecessors. Rehberg & General Magic and Matmos remained faithful to the throbbing, buzzing thingliness of their machines; Herbert swirled his source material into tastefully jazzy house until its provenance was largely moot. Kohl’s approach is less transformative and more literal. Even if it weren’t for titles like “Car Alarm, Turn Signal” and “Ice Cream Truck, Tornado Siren,” there’s a good chance that you could identify at least some of the sounds she uses. She makes no attempt to disguise the supermarket chimes of “Airport Fridge, Self Checkout,” or the flight attendant’s directions and nearby video-console bleeps on “Plane.” Instead, she uses them as creative prompts for her own writing, playing off what she overhears and finding music in the incidental, much the way Steve Reich exploited the musicality of his interlocutors in Different Trains. The album opens with the buzzing, fluorescent glare of “Tennis Court Light, Snow,” harsh and grating; plucking and bowing at her cello, Kohl tempers its nagging ostinato and keeps pushing outward, sketching out an imaginary expanse that is eventually punctuated by footsteps crunching through snow. Kohl’s found sounds never feel gimmicky, thanks in large part to the intentionality with which she integrates them. When a fasten-seatbelt chime goes off, her overdubbed cellos answer in key, as though the overhead signal had inspired an impromptu performance of Terry Riley’s In C. In “Car Alarm, Turn Signal,” she mashes down the keys on her synth, creating gently dissonant tone clusters to match the ruckus of rush-hour traffic, then uses the perfect fifth of a car alarm’s nagging whee-ooo as the frame for a somber, contemplative cello passage. It’s remarkable: She finds meditative grace in the city’s most annoying sounds. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the difference between what’s found and what’s played, as her keyboard or her cello picks up an overheard melody and runs with it. You get the sense that she’s following the natural course of the music, teasing it out until it reaches its conclusion. Nowhere is that clearer than in the album’s final track, “Ignition, Sneakers.” For nearly five minutes, an automotive chime pings away at an incessant high F-sharp, while Kohl uses it as a kind of scaffolding for dubby synth chords and expressively bowed cello. Toward the end, the music fades away but the pinging remains, growing increasingly maddening; there’s a sense of palpable relief when she finally removes the key from the ignition and the tone goes silent, leaving only the reassuring murmur of birds in the background. It’s a canny way to close the album, bringing every aspect of the music into sharp relief. Even the sudden silence feels vivid.",0,"September 3, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lia-kohl-normal-sounds/
High Vis,Guided Tour,7.6,Rock,"By the time Blur were excoriating the repressed English middle class, they had already flung themselves beyond it, riding high as their records bounded up the UK charts. So, too, had Oasis, who weaponized their working-class Mancunian street cred against the quasi-posh art school boys in Blur. Whether the subject was a disgruntled civil servant or low-life pleasures, Britpop is eternally bound up in UK class tensions. Despite their deep roots in the UK hardcore scene, London five-piece High Vis draw upon that long tradition. On their third record, Guided Tour, they present a rousing Britpop manifesto that transmutes grime and drudgery into raw-nerved power ballads. Though his bandmates—bassist Jack Muncaster, guitarists Martin MacNamara and Rob Hammaren, and drummer Edward “Ski” Harper—hail from all corners of the UK and Ireland, High Vis frontman Graham Sayle grew up in a working-class family in northwest England. On the group’s song “0151,” he sang about his late uncle, a former shipyard worker and union member who died of asbestosis. “You’ll live and die on the banks of the Mersey,” he sang, admonishing the “suffеring sold as pride” he witnessed while living in a town affected by Margaret Thatcher’s “managed decline.” High Vis’ first two albums—2019’s No Sense No Feeling and Blending, from 2022—were as scuffed and battered as the subjects they approached. Producer Jonah Falco, who manned the decks on Blending, and has sculpted UK punk records by Chisel and Chubby and the Gang, deserves some credit for the rattling joy that propels Guided Tour. But much of this blinding High Vis glow radiates from the bandmates’ personal triumphs. Multiple members quit their day jobs to pursue music full-time. Sayle kicked booze, got married, and stuck with therapy. High Vis are still pragmatists, though, and even a song titled “Feeling Bless” is tempered by drab images of “metallic smoke” and “killing dreams by Clipper light.” Sayle doesn’t ascribe his blessed existence to any higher purpose, claiming that “luck or fate” are equally viable explanations. The rapture, then, is largely instrumental. “Feeling Bless” is a high-elevation anthem that soars on gusts of reverb and rock-god guitar. Sayle’s sober vignettes reveal his matter-of-fact grip on the world, but it’s gratifying enough to lean back and let the massive chorus and Sayle’s stretched-out Scouse accent wash over you. The title track is just as exultant, sharing DNA with Leisure-era Blur and, dare I say, the early work of stadium denizens U2. “Guided Tour” churns to jangly, high-tone guitar and toms with the wallop of Doc Martens on pavement. Sayle’s opening cry—“You’re desperate to feel more/For once in your life”—could be the driving desire behind all of High Vis’ music: the search for something gilded amid the scrap heap. For all of the massive hooks and beaming melodies, High Vis don’t completely tear up their hardcore CVs. Sayle shouts more than sings on the muscular “Drop Me Out” and “Mob DLA,” both weighted with doomy rhythm guitar and battered drums. He wrote “Mob DLA” in response to the labyrinthine bureaucracy guarding disability resources (Sayle has witnessed his brother, who lives with autism and cerebral palsy, struggle within the system for years). “Drop Me Out” deals in shared trauma and broken loyalty: “Can’t pick your mates, or your co-defendants,” Sayle belts, as fuzzed-out rhythm guitar chugs underneath. His seemingly glib nod to meeting “for an RIP”—referring to friends he only sees at other friends’ funerals—suggests this happens far more often than it should. But even in all this despair, High Vis toss in a life-affirming chorus here, a radiant solo there: something to grab onto against the threat of sinking. They’ve managed to smuggle working-class subject matter into grand, gleaming Britpop without sacrificing their hardcore ethos or the scrappy hope that keeps them in forward motion. So it’s especially exciting that Guided Tour’s best song veers in yet another direction. Lead single “Mind’s a Lie” takes a cue from house and trip-hop, bobbing to a laid-back sample by South London DJ and singer Ell Murphy. Harper sent the initial demo to Sayle, unsure of its place in High Vis’ catalog. “We just sort of pushed it,” Sayle told NME of the writing process. It’s an effortless fit; the rolling bassline and four-on-the-floor kick nod to Sayle and Harper’s pre-punk years, when they were deep into jungle and techno. Rather than dusting off a relic of the past, High Vis retool it to serve who they have become. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Magdalena Bay,Imaginal Disk,7.7,Pop/R&B,"The setup for Magdalena Bay’s new concept album, Imaginal Disk, begins somewhere that looks like the beginning of 2001: A Space Odyssey, except that co-producers and songwriters Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin have identified the missing evolutionary link connecting primates to humans: an extraterrestrial LaserDisc, inserted into the forehead. When Tenenbaum’s character, True, comes due for a hardware upgrade, her body rejects it. This next part is a little unclear, but according to the band she must then relearn “what it means to be human.” You’ll want to excuse them for coming up with a YA sci-fi paperback’s worth of shtick when they pull off this whopper of a feghoot in track 11: “Feeling DiskInserted?” Since their inception in 2016, Magdalena Bay have made aqueous internet pop and low-voltage funk full of pinwheeling arpeggios and inside jokes. Imaginal Disk sounds like that, but bigger and punchier—more keyboards! More percussion tracks! Add a string section!! Synth harp!!! The total effect brings to mind ’90s Madchester, the progression of Tame Impala after Lonerism, and peak CD sonics, by which I mean a point in time when record companies were positively rolling in it and backing the production of bangers on the scale of George Michael’s “Freedom! ’90” or New Radicals’ “You Get What You Give”—and the big splashy chorus on Imaginal Disk’s “Death & Romance” sounds not a little like “You Get What You Give.” But as opposed to the traditional big-tent populist come-together anthem, Mag Bay’s project is something like the messy slide of signifiers one encounters scrolling the internet: They warp this fundamentally optimistic musical mode to suit a more cynical and paranoid reality. “I think what would be a positive thing is if we start to be seen less as a pop group and more like an ‘alternative’ group,” Lewin told The Line of Best Fit recently, citing the band’s distance from any actual pop chart. Can’t blame him for not wanting to sign up for a stan army, though I wonder if Mag Bay aren’t also alluding to a bias of marketing demographics that tends to tip feminine-presenting singers—particularly someone like Tenenbaum, whose style resembles Tennis’ Alaina Moore or Gwen Stefani covering Talk Talk—toward “pop.” Modern pop, though, is the perfect setting for Magdalena Bay: candy floss melodies, sticky hooks, and the creeping sense that all is not well—that no one should be capable of maintaining such shiny happy sincerity in public without some kind of nefarious brain-swap operation happening behind the scenes. More than the precise details of this story, Magdalena Bay invest in outfitting the in-game world, a flow state experience with a loose relationship to standard verse-chorus structure. “Watching TV” sounds like the theme song for centerpiece track “Tunnel Vision,” five minutes that seem to last longer, teasing their way to an all-out noodle-off that readily evokes Mag Bay’s own history as a left-field pop act fighting its way out from inside a former prog rock band. La-la-la-laser skronker “That’s My Floor” asks: Have you considered accessing a higher truth via the elevator? “I let it open me,” Tenenbaum coos, revolutionizing our perception of lobbies and office spaces. They’re lucky the greater concept works because not every song totally does. Modular bubble bath “Vampire in the Corner” is more precious than sinister. The Steve Lacy whisper-funk vibe on “Love Is Everywhere” circles outer-ring cantina band territory. Maybe that’s all part of the plot? When Tenenbaum sings things that don’t make a great deal of sense, you wonder whether you’d fare any better if someone hit your brain eject. Lyrics are not necessarily the most legible part of this adventure and I don’t suggest trying to dissect them too carefully—best to keep an open mind about POV. Sometimes Tenenbaum is the voice of conscience and sometimes she’s the replicant. On “True Blue Interlude” she sounds like a spokeswoman for disc-implant procedures: “It’s here. Say hello. It’s you,” she says with the hair-raising certainty of a shampoo voiceover introducing a celebrity’s brand-new face. Later, on “Fear, Sex,” she sounds suspicious of the very idea of the computer-enhanced human: “Shoulda known those dirty bastards/Would put wires in your head.” (They’ve been listening to Pink Floyd.) In a final wink, the story of True is based on a true story: the journey each of us take to become ourselves. With “The Ballad of Matt & Mica,” Mag Bay license some artistic self-mythology that could pass for the real-life Tenenbaum’s account of how she ended up in Los Angeles, working in show biz with Lewin. It’s a fundamentally happy ending, another factor shifting the aesthetic balance toward pop. As a faintly grandiose electronic-groove-rock album with romantic, slightly overwrought bookending autobiographical set pieces, we might think of Imaginal Disk as something like the candyflipped L.A. version of Bowie’s Black Tie White Noise. (I’d go to that party.) The best part, always, is the way Mag Bay songs work simultaneously on the level of quintessentially “mindless” pop and as a tongue-in-cheek critique—call it an “alternative”—of the same.

Midland,Fragments of Us,7.4,Electronic,"To this day and sadly into the probable future, people who love and fuck people of their own gender and/or resist the idea of gender entirely have been unwelcome in daily life. This is one reason we helped think up “nightlife,” that is, various worlds for our own convening and communing. Dance and electronic music has always been queer, from Joe Meek and Wendy Carlos to SOPHIE and LSDXOXO, and it’s always been key to nightlife’s power. One way to tell a history of LGBTQ+ people today, then, is to make electronic music; another is to simply listen. Midland’s Fragments of Us does both at once. It’s an ambient-electro pocket history of British and American gay subcultures. In 2016, Midland became an overnight sensation with the megahit “Final Credits,” which lovingly married a 1980 funk gem by Lee Alfred to an all-time anthem by Gladys Knight & the Pips from 1972. It’s the platonic ideal of a one-last-song: music to say goodbye to that’s about not wanting to say goodbye. It makes a moment from moments of the past. Since then, the producer born Harry Agius has released a series of EPs that rely less on sampling and more on his glittering facility with various currents of house music, while continuing to DJ and curate queer parties and events. For his full-length debut, he might have offered a clutch of reasons to gather on the dancefloor. Instead, Fragments of Us is an album in the sense of being a collection—of people, moments, ideas, and historical records. It begins with what the love that dared not speak its name could say: Polari, the early 20th-century British slang that gives radiophonic opener “Omi-Palone” (a term for effeminate or gay men) its name. The title track follows, with gently stumbling percussion and pads as woozy as the thrill of a secret crush. Then come nightmares. “In My Head” deploys samples of newscasters and politicians the way rave and hardcore tracks used horror movie dialog, examining the real-life terrorism of Margaret Thatcher’s Section 28 laws, which outlawed the “promotion” of homosexuality in Britain from 1988 until 2003 and paved the way for similar laws gathering force across the United States today. Midland forces these texts into a whirring clamor of industrial explosions, nagging melodies, and static. Section 28 was a chilling zone to grow up in, as Midland did; worse, of course, were the first waves of the AIDS crisis. But the dead are still with us, in memory and in recordings that Midland deploys as nimbly as he did on “Final Credits,” to devastating impact. Through the hauntological murk of “David’s Dream,” the heroically furious artist and writer David Wojnarowicz ruminates on his own mortality via a voice recording he made before his death from AIDS in 1992. The voice of Tongues United director Marlon Riggs, who died in 1994, appears on “Construct a Future,” and in this case, that stupid old genre name “intelligent dance music” really fits. Riggs addresses what he calls the “mutual apathy” and “distrust” that divides white gay communities from Black communities—two groups among the most central to the construction of underground nightlife. It’s sampling as reanimation. The living get their say, too. Midland offers his own monologue in the rustling ballad “Never Enough,” which sounds like it might be about the impossible bind of trying to wrest free of the past. His words, though, are buried in the alienated mechanics of a vocoder. It’s as if he’s wearing that old instrument of dancefloor abandon as a mask—a bit like Jonny Seymour of Australian underground organizer Stereogamous. “1983-1996” makes space for Seymour to talk about the years in which great branches of gay men were felled, more of every kind of person mourned, and world leaders just laughed. Beneath, Midland offers dub techno warm as a blanket and sad as a shroud. But despite the grief, or even because of it, there’s work to be done. Fragments shows you how nightlife gets built: Horse Meat Disco’s Luke Howard talks about getting his hands dirty helping birth the notorious UK queer party that “NYCDL” is named for. “Chapter 10” pays a tribute to another infamous UK nightlife gathering, but among its groovy swells and climaxes, voices are just crowd noise in the distance, as if the party is too good to talk about. Guess you had to be there. I have my doubts about the revolutionary potential of spaces like Horse Meat Disco or the gay campout Honcho, in Pennsylvania, where Midland has DJed and on whose dancefloor he says he first got the inspiration for this record; all such parties require so much financial, temporal, and/or sexual capital to access. But it’s not a revolution if you can’t shake your ass, and luckily Fragments includes the crackling electro of “You Said You’d Be Good” to soundtrack your shimmy, along with a pair of ideal come-down companions: “Vogue in Slow Motion,” all blips and drips, and “First Light Over the Grove,” which sighs with rose-gold strings and laps of organs, as happily-ever-after as you’d hope a Fire Island romance to be, if you can afford it. And “Ritual,” the album highlight, offers up a sample of Arthur Russell’s “Lucky Cloud” for a goosebumping bit of 2-step that sounds like a heavenly body tickling your ear. If that’s not something to live for, what is?",0,"October 7, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/midland-fragments-of-us/
KMRU,Natur,8.0,Electronic / Experimental,"Every city has its own sound—literally. Beyond whatever music might get played there, every place on earth emits a set of frequencies that is completely unique. For Joseph Kamaru, these identities are as distinct as skylines. “Soundscapes reveal a lot about how people think and behave,” he recently told Resident Advisor. He notices them when he goes somewhere new and explores them in his music. Often, they make him think of his home city, Nairobi. Kamaru moved to Berlin in 2020. Since then, he’s recorded over a dozen records that position him as a master of esoteric sound: a blend of ambient, drone, noise, and field recordings, defined by tactile sound design and an emotional palette that runs from haunting to serene. In 2022, he composed what would become As Nature, a live show inspired, as he put it in an email, by “the electromagnetic sounds and hidden noises in Nairobi that are so present that the inhabitants of the city become connected with them.” He played it again and again at experimental events across Europe, tweaking it until he formed an intense bond with the music. “I became it,” he says. Natur, which arrives on the UK label Touch, is the album version of that performance. In its attempt to capture ineffable qualities of his home city, it is also a personal record. It is, like much of Kamaru’s music, subtly political as well, shifting the focus to an East African city in an art form dominated by Western bias. More than anything, though, it shows his unique way of hearing the world around him in extraordinary detail, and shaping those impressions into a surreal musical work. A single, 52-minute piece, Natur bobs and weaves through crackling noise and balmy ambience. For Kamaru, the sound of Nairobi at night is all about electricity, from the hiss of open transformers to electrosmog—sounds inaudible to the naked ear but captured by Kamaru’s electromagnetic microphones—all set against a darkness deep enough to be broken by low-lit iPhone screens. In its calmer sections, Natur serves up whispers, birdsong, footfalls and muffled crowds, humid drones and barely-there melodic loops. In its more chaotic sections, frequencies wail, whoosh, and crash. Above all, they buzz. At times the album feels like a gallery of the countless distinct forms electrical buzzing can take. Ambient as much of it is, the result is the opposite of background music. Natur is a voltaic odyssey, a ghost train rumbling, twisting and floating through this aural rendering of Nairobi at night. Kamaru has written about what he calls “activated listening,” a closely intentional form of listening that Natur demands of its listeners from its opening section, a swelling wave of electrical currents that crests just before it short-circuits. Perhaps because it took shape as a live performance, this is a dynamic, ever-evolving composition, one that moves through a sequence of scenes as distinct as they are abstract. Take the passage about 15 minutes in, when a barrage of white-hot frequencies mercifully gives way to a haze of soothing, natural sounds. Kamaru follows this pattern for much of the record’s first half, swerving through a thicket of noise, then slipping, at just the right moment, into a stretch of relative serenity. After a while, the two modes blur together into something droning and hypnotic. Every moment along this drifting path is bursting with vivid detail. Layered together or presented in turn, Kamaru’s sounds are carefully sculpted and lovingly displayed, artifacts of the invisible world his work explores. It’s usually hard to tell field recordings—presented as-is or embellished in the studio—apart from sounds entirely of his creation. Still, the record demonstrates something Kamaru senses more easily than the rest of us, which is the richness and drama of everyday sounds. Natur helps us hear what he hears.

Tucker Zimmerman,Dance of Love,7.4,Folk/Country,"Dance of Love, the eleventh album from Tucker Zimmerman, wouldn’t exist without the advocacy of Big Thief. The neo-folk group coaxed the reclusive singer-songwriter out of his seclusion in Belgium, the country he’s called home for over 40 years, to join them in a cabin in New England to write and record Dance of Love, the album that will introduce the 83-year-old musician to the largest audience he has ever known. Arriving 55 years after his debut, Dance of Love is also effectively Zimmerman’s first album to receive an initial release in his native America. Raised on beatnik poetry in the 1950s, he spent the 1960s wandering on the fringes of the folk and blues revivals, landing a co-writing credit with blues harpist Paul Butterfield on his 1967 LP The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw with a song called “Droppin’ Out.” Zimmerman took his own advice, departing America for Europe, and studied music in Rome on a Fulbright scholarship before heading to London to sing folk music. A stroke of luck brought him into contact with Tony Visconti, a fledgling record producer fresh off his first collaborations with Marc Bolan’s Tyrannosaurus Rex. The pair made his debut, Ten Songs, an earnest and sober collection that hinted at Visconti’s majestic orchestrations but not the homespun style Zimmerman later cultivated. Ten Songs did find one prominent champion in David Bowie, a friend and lifelong collaborator of Visconti’s. Bowie touted the album in a list of “25 albums that could change your reputation” for a 2003 issue of Vanity Fair. There is so little writing on Zimmerman that Bowie’s 107-word blurb is often cited as descriptions of the singer/songwriter’s music, particularly the assessments that “the guy’s way too qualified for folk” and “I always found this album of stern, angry compositions enthralling.” It’s possible to hear what Bowie heard on Ten Songs: earnest and internally adventurous, its yearning poetic bent is saved from austerity by Visconti’s imaginative production. With its trippy echoes, sincere strums, and occasional fuzz freakouts, it’s a period artifact, the kind of record that feels perched on the precipice of discovery. Zimmerman didn’t follow any of the possible avenues outside of Ten Songs. Faced with an uncertain future—dodging the draft, he was intent on not returning to America—he chose to retreat with his wife Marie Claire to her homeland of Belgium, where they established a creative enclave filled with art. Although he continued to compose music, Zimmerman walked away from recording in the early 1980s, not long after he released Square Dance, the 1980 LP Big Thief’s Adrianne Lenker happened to hear when getting a tattoo not so long ago. Entranced by its intimacy, Lenker played Square Dance for her bandmate Buck Meek, who also became a fan. The pair attempted to enlist Zimmerman as an opening act for Big Thief’s European tour of 2022, a plan that evolved into Zimmerman and Marie Claire agreeing to join Big Thief for two weeks in a New England cabin where they recorded Dance of Love. Dance of Love reflects its intimate origins; it sounds as if a bunch of musicians were captured playing in a living room on a Sunday afternoon. Big Thief’s gentle sway warms and illuminates Zimmerman’s songs, adding spectral space to the meditative “The Season” and bringing a rustic ramble to “Old Folks of Farmersville.” The atmosphere may be subdued but the collective, often aided by guests Twain (aka Mat Davidson) and Iji (aka Zach Burba), don’t quite settle into coziness. Whenever Zimmerman brings out a blues shuffle, Big Thief emphasizes the backbeat, giving “The Idiot’s Maze” a tangible swing and even lending a measure of grit to “Nobody Knows.” Lenker’s tender, quivering singing provides a striking complement to his weathered, not worn, voice. Countering each other’s lines as often as harmonizing, the pair are an imperfect yet comfortable fit; their imperfections lend a sense of grace to the gentle lilt of “Lorelei” and a keening longing to “Burial at Sea.” Lenker and Zimmerman aren’t the only voices on Dance of Love. Marie Claire sings the verses on “Leave It On the Porch Outside,” answered by the rest of the group on the ragged chorus. Her presence underscores the communal cheer at the heart of the album and also highlights the humor and humanity that run through these ten songs. Unlike Zimmerman’s previous Ten Songs, these tunes can’t be characterized as “stern, angry.” They’re warm, welcoming, and forgiving, a testament to how Zimmerman settled into his skin when he found a home far from the spotlight. Even so, no knowledge of his long, shadowy history is needed for Dance of Love to work its charms: Its understated joy and gratitude are palpable.

Osees,Sorcs 80,7.3,Rock,"If you zoned out of John Dwyer’s mutant garage-scuzz outfit somewhere around the time they evolved from Thee Oh Sees into Osees, you might take SORCS 80 for the work of a different band. All sampled squalor and lo-tech distortion, SORCS 80 thrashes and pulses without the aid of a single guitar, the product of Dwyer’s decision to abandon six strings for electronics. Dwyer specializes in these kinds of abrupt turns: He sheds styles faster than he changes band names, splicing prog and punk without considering whether his monster can survive. As combative as it gets, SORCS 80 represents a settling of sorts for Osees—a place where the lacerating punk of A Foul Form and the pugnacious synth-pop of Intercepted Message intertwine. Taking inspiration from the nervy post-punk pulse of Intercepted Message, Dwyer decided to create SORCS 80 using samplers, approaching the electronics with the finesse of a caveman. Alongside Osees keyboardist Tom Dolas, he hotwired four-track demos through Roland SPD-SX sampling pads, which the pair then triggered with drumsticks. Neither musician plays their signature instrument: Their work comes through the samplers in shards glued together by bassist Tim Hellman and decorated by saxophonists CansFis Foote and Brad Caulkins. Those saxophones are intended to recall the shambolic soul of Dexys Midnight Runners, another chief inspiration for Dwyer here. If you squint, it’s possible to discern echoes of Searching for the Young Soul Rebels on “Earthling,” where he’s buoyed by nagging horns as he bellows from his gut like Kevin Rowland. Soul isn’t the only style the saxophones stir up: On “Drug City,” the sax conjures the ghost of James Chance, landing squarely between no wave and new wave. What’s fascinating about SORCS 80 is that it feels vaguely rootless—some sounds are familiar but the form is not. That isn’t to say Dwyer has chucked out hooks or melodies the way he did his guitar. SORCS 80 contains some of his sharpest recent songwriting—the tunes just happen to get transformed by the Osees’ execution. “Termination Officer” shoves its glammed-up chorus through a digital shredder; “Cochon d’Argent” floods with synth burbles and hyperactive beats. Sometimes, the dense electronic fog lifts: “Lear’s Ears” has enough air in its rhythms to suggest funk, a trick replicated on “Also the Gorilla…,” which pairs the album’s nimblest groove with one of its catchiest tunes. Hooks or even individual songs are hardly the point, though. SORCS 80 is an immersive listen. Hearing the Osees wrestle with their equipment, forcing the instruments—and themselves—to behave in ways they are not accustomed is a visceral experience. Bashing away at samplers as if they’re drums, the band sounds like it’s breaking out of the cave and into the modern world.

Childish Gambino,Bando Stone and the New World,5.8,Rap,"When I was 14, I was introduced to Childish Gambino through his 2010 mixtapes I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just a Rapper 2. This was when he was a sitcom star first and a rapper second, rapping with a glut of pop culture references, getting off punchline after punchline in a congested voice that made him sound like Urkel doing Da Drought 3. I liked them because they were satire, or maybe not, and maybe that was the point. If anything, the mixtapes were endearingly corny, nerdy, and goofy—he played with a rap character he was forming and hinted at the racial insecurities that would make 2011’s Camp a pop-rap disaster. All these years later, Childish Gambino is merely a side project of Donald Glover, who has worked tirelessly to shift the perception of himself from nerdy, goofy, and insecure Black artist to a cool, layered, and serious Black artist. I think of his 2018 New Yorker profile in which he said, “I learn fast—I figured out the algorithm,” and described his “superpower” as getting people to believe whatever he wanted them to about him if he tried hard enough. He did try and it worked. “Awaken, My Love!” from 2016 was essentially his Parliament-meets-Maxwell funk project. It’s nowhere near as soulful or groovy as he wanted it to be (I’ll give it up for “Riot,” though), but it did infuse his music with the stamp of Blackness he was thirsty for. Then there was the song and video for “This Is America,” more vague and less radical than its reputation, but it instantly gave his songs the aura of importance. And, oh yeah, there’s this television show he created called Atlanta, one of the best shows of the 21st century, the thing that makes good on his desire to make exceptional Black art. Through dark comedy and the hyperlocal lens of his hometown, the show blurs the lines between persona and reality, a thought he was veering toward on the 2013 project Because the Internet. And yet the greatest achievement of Atlanta is much more straightforward: It was funny as hell. There’s not much of a sense of humor on Bando Stone and the New World, billed as Donald Glover’s final album as Childish Gambino. The reason he gave The New York Times? “It’s not fulfilling. And I just felt like I didn’t need to build in this way anymore.” You can feel that in how he seems burdened with the pressure of living up to the perception he has molded for himself. It’s a strained album that so badly wants to end the Childish Gambino experiment with a bang, that wants to be a middle finger to everyone who ever thought he didn’t have the range to pull off whatever he set his sights on, that wants to be the kind of vulnerable record that lasts because a new generation of teenagers see themselves in his music. That’s fine and all. Atlanta had similar ambitions baked in. But also, the best episodes featured something you had never seen before in your life, and it was exciting to watch Donald and his writers’ room subvert the expectations of TV. Meanwhile, Bando Stone and the New World is a familiar slog, and the swings feel algorithmic rather than experimental. Think of all of the albums over the last decade or so that have shaped the identities of teenagers, or at least teenagers who buy records off the end-caps at Urban Outfitters: Bando Stone extracts a little bit of that sauce while sounding nowhere near as compelling as the originals. Yeezus is one, of course, not a big surprise considering that Gambino has always worshiped the showmanship, contradictions, and music of Kanye. Here, his throbbing, glitchy, pitch-shifting intro “H3@RT$ W3RE M3@NT T0 F7¥” with a chant of “Everybody Satan and I’m G-O-D” aims for the provocativeness of Ye’s 2013 heat check, but it’s more like one of the joyless, angry blasts of noise you’ll find on Donda. Then, like some of SZA’s SOS, he does the pop-punk nostalgia thing on “Running Around,” but instead of raging like she did, it’s more unbearably cutesy in the vein of Teezo Touchdown. I can’t forget “Got to Be,” a chaotic sample-heavy mashup that brings to mind the mayhem of JPEGMAFIA, though his crate digging would be more adventurous than weaving together the Prodigy and Uncle Luke. Of the spiritual raids going on here, the most effective is Frank Ocean’s style of R&B. That could be because the album is covered with the fingerprints of Michael Uzowuru, a megastar whisperer who once loomed around the Odd Future camp and was behind a few of Frank’s most memorable songs, including “Chanel” and “Nights.” Uzowuru has production credits on the seven-minute “No Excuses” (along with Glover and his longtime collaborator Ludwig Göransson) and it has this slow-mo jazziness that feels like lightweight Fela Kuti that meshes well with Gambino’s sweet, cloudy Blonde-esque croons. He pulls it off well enough—I’ve liked his voice since the 106 & Park–era R&B hums he hit at the end of his Sway freestyle in 2013. I’d say the same for “Steps Beach” (co-produced by Steve Lacy), which is fuzzy lyrically but his swooning falsetto is incredibly romantic. His singing goes off the rails when he steps outside of this zone, specifically the theatrical “Lithonia.” The album is supposed to be a soundtrack for a film that he hasn’t released yet, so maybe “Lithonia” will make more sense inside a different narrative arc, though that won’t change that his full-throated belts make him sound like Troy Bolton. Gambino doesn’t even sound like he’s having that much fun trying on all these new hats; the main point just seems to be that range = greatness. A few moments say otherwise, like the high-pitched flexing mode Amaarae and Flo Milli put him onto on “Talk My Shit” or the intergalactic vibe out with Yeat on “Cruisin’.” He does have some heavier thoughts bubbling, such as fatherhood and aging on “Dadvocate” and “Can You Feel Me.” Both are incredibly earnest moments from an artist whose earnestness is always up for debate. But maybe that’s the problem. It’s hard to grasp who Childish Gambino is supposed to be. So even when he’s genuine, I have a little bit of skepticism on my mind. That’s always what kept me at a distance from Gambino’s music, constantly wondering What does he want to get out of this? The only thing that stops me from doing that is when the project is just so great that I forget about that question entirely, like Atlanta was and how Bando Stone and the New World isn’t. Still, there is one song from the album I’ve been stuck on: “Yoshinoya,” one of the few straight-up rap tracks. It has some of that goofball cheesiness that marked the I Am Just a Rapper series. In the second verse he mentions his Chick-fil-A order, calls out the “old heads” who clown his “short shorts and PRO-Keds”, and criticizes cosplaying rappers. He doesn’t usually write verses that silly anymore, but it feels right. Because even for how radically his music has morphed over the years, the blustering smart-ass still feels like the closest I ever got to knowing Childish Gambino.",0,"July 23, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/childish-gambino-bando-stone-and-the-new-world/
Jack White,No Name,7.6,Rock,"Somewhere between his increasingly fussy solo albums, and certainly by the time he started policing audiences’ cell phones, it became clear that Jack White was not the uninhibited nonconformist he played so convincingly with the White Stripes. Since that duo disbanded in 2011, White has systematically sucked almost all the fun from his image, revealing that this avatar of effortless cool was actually bound by a complicated code of unwritten rules he was more than happy to lecture music publications about. It’s been a heel turn akin to watching the coolest senior in your high school return as the district’s biggest stickler of a substitute teacher. What a difference one record can make. Of all the considerable feats pulled by White’s raucous, ripping, unrelenting sixth solo album, No Name, perhaps the most remarkable is how cleanly it wipes the slate after a decade-plus of traditionalist scolding, divisive experiments, and creative misfires. No Name reconnects White with the primal impulses that made the Stripes so undeniable. It’s a comeback that instantly announces itself as a contender for White’s best solo record: 42 minutes of amp-busting blues punk that reveals the old Jack White was behind the curtain all along, hungry and undiminished, waiting for the right moment to make his reentrance. Thanks to savvy guerilla marketing, No Name arrives with its lore prewritten. It was surprise-released July 19 at White’s Third Man Records shops, where uncredited, white-sleeved pressings were slipped into the bags of unsuspecting customers. This wasn’t like the time White hid 7""s inside of reupholstered furniture, though. He wanted the world to hear and discover this record, and Third Man’s social accounts encouraged fans to “rip it” and share. The project’s raw immediacy initially suggested it might be throwaway, a palette cleanser before White resumed his usual studio tinkering, but its triple-octane riffage and seething, sticky hooks pointed to something more lasting and substantial. Even the last couple of White Stripes albums weren’t this stacked. The all killer, no filler ethos is a far cry from Fear of the Dawn, the absolutely gonzo solo record White released in 2022. Where that record invited listeners to marvel at its virtuosity and gawk at its sadistically counterintuitive creative choices, No Name leans into his most intuitive, meat-and-potato impulses. Opener “Old Scratch Blues” thrashes with the gravity of Led Zeppelin’s most titanic riffs, while “That’s How I’m Feeling” plays like a belated stab at one last great, aughts-style rock revival single. “Bombing Out” may be the most convincing two and half minutes of scuzzy hardcore you’ll hear from a 49-year-old this year. White’s churlish demeanor belies the radical empathy of his worldview. On “It’s Rough on Rats (If You’re Asking),” he asks for consideration of the have-nots (“As bad as we got it/It sure must be rough on rats”). On “Archbishop Harold Holmes,” he sermonizes over itchy, AC/DC-caliber guitar licks that “hate is trying to take someone else’s love for yourself/But I’m here to tell you that love is trying to help someone else.” With its pit-starting thrash, “Bless Myself” similarly leans into White’s screaming-pastor shtick, preaching the virtues of divorcing spirituality from organized religion: “‘God on command/God on demand’/If God’s too busy I’ll bless myself!” Of course, the lyrics never matter as much as the authority with which he sneers, spits, and barks. It’s amazing how dialing up the conviction can turn “uh oh, Jack White is rapping” into “fuck yeah, Jack White is rapping.” In a certain light, a back-to-basics project like this could seem like a retreat, an easy win for an artist who hasn’t scored in a while. Yet there’s real risk in releasing an album that so brazenly invites comparison to White’s best work, especially amid the hardening conventional wisdom about the irreplaceability of Meg White. With No Name, White resets the narrative: If he fell off, it was on his own terms. Now he’s back and in total mastery of a domain no other act claimed in his absence. Maybe he really can turn it on like a light switch. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

J.U.S,3rd Shift,8.2,Rap,"Detroit and the Bay Area are two rap meccas that are forever intertwined. Some theorize the bond goes back to the early days of the Great Migration when a few automobile plants moved from Detroit to Oakland; others claim the ties were built through generations of hustling. Payroll Giovanni, a modern-day icon of Detroit rap, considered the synchronicity to have fully bloomed in hip-hop when influential local crew the Street Lord’z were collaborating with Bay Area stars like E-40, Spice 1, and Too $hort in the late ’90s and early 2000s. For his part, Too $hort said, “Detroit, it’s like Oakland/It’s a Black thing and I’m a Black man.” (Hey, sometimes it’s really that simple.) If Too $hort’s Detroit shoutout was the proposal, then the Street Lord’z’s 1999 cross-pollinated debut mixtape was the wedding day. That’s all to explain why Detroit’s J.U.S and Oakland’s Squadda B sound as if they share the same brain right out the gate on their first joint album, 3rd Shift. On the mic is J.U.S, a longtime engineer and producer with Bruiser Brigade, the Danny Brown–led crew of elder-millennial shit-talkers. In the last few years, he’s turned his attention to slick-tongued, autobiographical rhymes. Behind the boards is Squadda, formerly one-half of rap duo Main Attrakionz, who dropped one of the great mixtapes of the early 2010s with 808s & Dark Grapes II. Together, on 3rd Shift, they’re a loose-lipped, hi-hat-happy riot. J.U.S’ storytelling is personal and funny as hell: a lifetime of balancing Detroit player status and more ordinary responsibilities has him worn down. “I’m on the road doin’ shows I don’t miss my bitch/She be hatin’, say I’m old, I should fuckin’ quit,” he raps on “Da Best Out,” sounding as weathered as Lethal Weapon’s Roger Murtaugh. Squadda underlines the mood with a stringy beat that could appear in a spaghetti western, a genre full of aging gunslingers clinging to their dreams. Squadda’s instrumentals are miraculously suffocating and untrendy: He sounds like he’s been disconnected from the internet for half a decade, which makes the beats feel fresh and unpredictable. No surprise with Bruiser Brigade: The clique has created a world rooted in regional scenes—Detroit, specifically—while working at their own unconcerned pace. J.U.S pulls that off on 3rd Shift, leaning into the hallmarks of his rapping-ass city: Sticky one-liners and imagery that is so outlandish that it has to be rooted in some sort of truth. I could imagine his Cash Money bars on “Nascar” fitting in with the luxurious flexes of Peezy and Babyface Ray; I could hear his smoothly rapped verse on “We Outside”—with mentions of his chicken wing order and gator shoes—on a posse cut with the sharp-witted punchline kings of Flint. The shift is from Detroit hustler talking like a small-time kingpin to Detroit hustler sounding stressed out in the need of a vacation, raps where you can tell he has lived a hundred lives and has multiple stories to tell about each one. On “Cheese Cheese Cheese,” his experience casts a gloomier mood as his struggles and insecurities pile up. On “6K” he approaches the never-ending grind with a relentless sense of humor: “I got mortgage, I got habits, I got freaks I owe a few.” Everyday headaches are still the greatest source of hip-hop comedy. Through all the stressors and wisecracks, his vivid Detroit chronicles just keep coming, complete with all the scenes and props: True Religion jeans, Air Force Ones, Cartier frames, and American-made cars. There’s not a lot of frills to his raps, but Squadda’s beats are always pulling him in different directions, rarely letting him get too comfortable. The energy cranks up to near Enrgy Beats levels on “No Love” and that pushes J.U.S to raise the wattage on his flow; the out-of-nowhere ghettotech bounce of “I Know U Tired” sparks an impassioned J.U.S verse that gives off the temporary high of clocking out of work on a Friday: “I try not eat swine but it’s good than a mother/I try not to do lines but they be callin’ a brother,” he goes. At times, it feels as if Squadda is cooking up beats just to see if he can trip up J.U.S. The buzzing one on “Somethin Else” sounds like it’s self-destructing and yet, J.U.S calmly rips it with a few drug-dealing analogies that could have been ghostwritten for Pusha T. The hypnotic two-stepper “Dont Do Drugs” feels like it’s pulsing in reverse, and J.U.S fools around with it, creating a sort of warped and tongue-in-cheek PSA. What makes 3rd Shift go is that it seems like a completely organic fusion, J.U.S and Squadda figuring out they’re on the same wavelength in real time. I shouldn’t be surprised, it’s a Detroit rapper and an Oakland producer after all, a connection so natural it has to be in the blood.",1,"August 15, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jus-3rd-shift/
Linda Thompson,Proxy Music,7.5,Rock,"Linda Thompson is best known as a singer and interpreter of someone else’s songs. A specific someone else: Richard Thompson, her ex-husband, with whom she made a few of the greatest British folk-rock albums ever as a duo in the 1970s and early ’80s, lending dignified poise to his tales of suffering and strife. Linda made one album after they broke up, then began struggling with a condition called spasmodic dysphonia, which causes involuntary contractions of the larynx that can make it difficult to sing or speak. She focused on family life and released no new music until the early 2000s, when treatment with Botox relaxed her vocal cords enough for her to make a careful comeback. The three albums she’s released since then are remarkable not only for the renewed power of her voice, but also for her emergence as a songwriter, a craft she honed when it seemed like she might never sing again. Thompson’s dysphonia has since worsened. Proxy Music, as its title cheekily suggests, is a collection of songs she wrote for other people to sing, inverting the composer-performer dynamic of her best-known work. With a few exceptions, the music, largely co-written with her and Richard’s son Teddy Thompson, could fit onto any of those classic ’70s records, with stately acoustic instrumentation and melodies that wind patiently without flashy pop hooks. Her sensibility as a lyricist is informed by the folk tradition, and she writes often about the sort of heartbreak and regret that also characterized her songs with Richard. But she’s also funny—sharper and daffier than she ever got to be as her ex’s melancholy mouthpiece. In “Or Nothing at All,” a piano ballad about unrequited affection performed tenderly by Martha Wainwright, Thompson describes true love’s deliverance not in terms of high passion, but absurd clinical precision: “A hundred men in their white coats/Would check you with their stethoscopes/And hand you straight to me.” “Shores of America,” sung by Dori Freeman from the perspective of a pioneer woman leaving a lousy partner behind in the old world, contains a zinger so good it’s hard to believe no one’s gotten to it before: “And if it’s true/That only the good die young/Lucky old you/’Cause you’ll be around until kingdom come.” Perhaps inspired by the unusual rotating-singer format or her years spent inflecting someone else’s words and melodies with her own personality, Thompson is playful and probing with notions of authorship and authenticity of voice that many other songwriters take for granted. She is especially attuned to the gradations of difference in perspective between a song’s writer, its singer, and the constructed character of its narrator. Proxy Music opens with “The Solitary Traveler,” an emotionally complex waltz whose lyrics, about a “wicked” woman who has lost her voice and the love of her child’s father, seem drawn from Thompson’s biography. But they also gesture in the direction of a folk-song stock role she was occasionally asked to play earlier in her career: the fallen woman, undone by her own bad choices, an object of both pity and scorn. By the end of the song, Thompson has turned this misogynistic archetype on its head. “I’m alone now, you’d think I’d be sad,” sings Kami Thompson, Linda and Richard’s daughter, brassy and assured. “No voice, no son, no man to be had/You’re wrong as can be boys, I’m solvent and free boys/All my troubles are gone.” “John Grant,” delivered by former Czars frontman John Grant, has a narrator whose heart has been stolen by a man named John Grant. It is both a Being John Malkovich-style metafictional hall of mirrors and a sweet portrait of the mutual quirks that develop in long relationships. “A moment on the lips/A lifetime on the hips” is how Thompson recounts the couple’s shared love of sweets. Later, we learn that they’re tree-huggers, an identity they take literally. “It chafes the arms a bit,” Grant sings with a sort of auditory suppressed smile, “And we don’t know if they’re into it.” He also contributes some pleasantly noodly electronic keyboard lines, sounding a bit like Jerry Garcia when he used MIDI to turn his guitar into a synth in the late ’80s and ’90s. It’s a strange incursion on an album otherwise committed to rustic instrumental textures, but a welcome one, heightening the uncanny aspect of the song’s premise. Proxy Music’s other experiments with relatively contemporary accents aren’t always as successful. The reverb-enhanced stomps, shouts, and claps of “That’s the Way the Polka Goes” serve to make its asymmetrical rhythm seem much more generic than it actually is, bringing an otherwise fine song dangerously close to Lumineers territory. “Three Shaky Ships” also has too much reverb, its cathedral-sized echoes and Rachel Unthank’s quietly portentous delivery evoking another mid-2010s musical cliche: It sounds like one of those spooky covers of famous pop songs you used to hear all the time in trailers for blockbuster movies. The album’s stunning closer is “Those Damn Roches,” a tribute to the titular singing sisters and various other famous musical clans, with lead vocals from Teddy Thompson. The delicate arcs of lead guitar sound a lot like Richard’s own, which may not be coincidental. The guitarist is Zak Hobbs, Richard and Linda’s grandson, son of their eldest daughter, Muna. Richard himself, who has contributed in various ways to all but one of Linda’s post-comeback albums, sings backup. (He also plays guitar on “I Used to Be So Pretty” and co-wrote “Three Shaky Ships.”) Inevitably, the subject turns to their own family in the final verse. “Faraway Thompsons tug at my heart/Can’t get along ’cept when we’re apart,” Teddy sings. “Is it life, or is it art?/One and the same.” Life and art have long been entwined with unusual intensity for Thompson. Shoot Out the Lights, her final album as a duo with Richard, was filled with songs about bitterly dissolving relationships, many of them apparently written while things were still happy between them, and released just as their real-life breakup was bringing their collaboration to an end. Proxy Music entwines them again. Turning Linda’s absence as a singer into a flickering subject of the music, rather than just an unfortunate circumstance of its creation, it is a strange and sometimes brilliant album—one that only Linda Thompson could have made, whether or not you can hear her singing.

Crumb,AMAMA,8.1,Rock,"Midway through Crumb’s new album, there’s a transitory, 49-second track called “Nightly News.” It’s groggy-sounding, a hazy sampler of cable-news synths and this-just-in swells; you get the sense that you’ve just woken up on the couch, and the TV is taunting you with whatever happened this time. Millions of cockroaches accidentally released from nearby research facility? Serial slasher last seen purchasing potato chips at local mini-mart? Nothing, it turns out: The song ends before revealing what the news actually is. It feels particularly apt for the New York band, who’ve spent the past near-decade churning out hypnotic epics with a sinister edge. In 2019, frontwoman Lila Ramani told Pitchfork that she wouldn’t “chill” to her group’s output. Dreamy as it is, their music is a wake-up call. Crumb aren’t the types to get eight hours of sleep. Their first two albums, 2019’s Jinx and 2021’s Ice Melt, seemed to revel in the space between 2 a.m. and daylight—not only because of their shared sound, a slightly unnerving take on psychedelia, but also the ideas that informed that sound, the sorts of things you have to dream up. If you asked them about Ice Melt’s underwater-y vocal mixes, they wouldn’t tell you about Ableton effects or post-session knob adjustments; they’d tell you how they put condoms on microphones and dunked them in buckets of water. Ramani sang of transient thoughts, fleeting curiosities about strawberry seeds (“BNR”) or dates with dark spirits (“Jinx”). AMAMA, the band’s third album, gets more playful and candid than ever, without sacrificing their signature red-eyed experimentation. It’s a sleeker, riskier, and more rewarding iteration of Crumb’s approach: proof that as their footprint has expanded, their palette has, too. Crumb take a microscope to foggy memories, gathering the ephemera of years spent staring through windows. They have roots in the New York scene—Ramani is an alum of Brooklyn ensemble Standing on the Corner; bassist Jesse Brotter appears on early tracks by MIKE—but their inventive jazz-psych invokes a wider set of peers, including Toronto’s BADBADNOTGOOD and Melbourne’s Hiatus Kaiyote. On “The Bug,” a hypnotic paean to caught flies and caught feelings, Ramani’s poetry is undergirded by a winding rhythm section that crawls like an insect. “Side by Side,” like the best Crumb songs, melds romance with vague mourning; when Ramani sings of “trying to run away” and the descending chord progression gives way to a feverish instrumental break, you get the sense that you’re running, too, but toward something—a seismic, supernatural encounter. Crumb’s music supplies a cinematic score for Ramani’s off-kilter scripts, slow-burn psychological thrillers that make you look over your shoulder, then at the world around you. When Crumb are in the director’s chair, humdrum reality is a spectacle that co-stars everybody. Ramani has a knack for ending songs on unfinished sentences, a quirk that presents serpentine tracks as verbal ouroboroi. In “AMAMA”’s enchanting denouement, damning repetitions of “But you coulda never known my name” dissolve into a less-damning “But you coulda,” the “coulda” hanging like an open hand. On “Crushxd,” the band pays tribute to a turtle flattened by its tour van—“Forgive me for this sin, killing a living thing, you were as small as a pin”—and outdoes the typical funeral dirge with circular, foot-tapping bass-keyboard interplay. In the final minute, swirling pitch shifts carry the track into a trance and “I’ll never see you here again” melts into a naked “Never see you”: both a farewell and a release of guilt. Crumb was conceived, in the mid-2010s, as a means of fully realizing songs Ramani had written years prior. They’ve come a long way since. The music doesn’t sound like an appendage or a backdrop anymore: It meanders where it used to lounge, screams where it used to whisper. Midway through “(Alone in) Brussels,” where the narrative is as winding as the instrumentation, a trip-hop break bathes Ramani’s high-pitched singsong in reverb and flanging, an amorphous deluge of liquid vowels, streaky keys, and bass notes that stagger like size-18 shoes. As a guitarist, Ramani rarely solos loudly; she’s more content using the strings as stilts, surveying the song with gangly, spiderish strides. At several moments, as on “Genie,” the words stop, and the guitar emerges as another voice, speaking a strange tongue synonymous with whatever she was saying before. AMAMA was produced by Johnscott Sanford and Foxygen’s Jonathan Rado (the latter also oversaw the recording of Ice Melt). If Crumb’s first two full-lengths squeezed worlds into safety-sized containers, this record is as authoritative as they’ve ever sounded. It sprawls in the vein of psych-pop genre-benders King Krule and Toro y Moi, but also manages to feel singular, a standalone statement of their ever-evolving identity. Like the best experimentalists, Crumb are their most potent when disparate elements interlock: a lucid dream you remember scene by scene, fragment by fragment.

Camera Obscura,"Look to the East, Look to the West",8.0,Rock,"The industrialization of nostalgia has grown so tedious that the comeback of an old favorite can elicit as much malaise as excitement these days. But news of Camera Obscura’s impending return stirred something hot and fluttery even in cycle-hardened indie-rock hearts. Stereogum “literally squealed,” as did I, as did probably anyone who followed the most loveable band in twee from around 2000 to 2015, a run cut short by the untimely death of keyboardist Carey Lander. How else could we express our feelings about music that, even at its saddest, had brought such unique delight—for reasons that, given its unpretentious style, were so hard to put into words? It took years to fathom someone sitting in for Lander, in which time Campbell also had a child. But reuniting in 2019 at the behest of Belle and Sebastian was a most fitting rebirth: In 2001, Stuart Murdoch had produced Camera Obscura’s debut, Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi. Indie fans were already gaga for one Glaswegian band with shy boy-girl vocals, old-fashioned pop underpinnings, and zesty, testy lyrics, and they were thrilled to get another one right from the source. Underachievers Please Try Harder, from 2003, perfected their style—plainspoken, sardonic, deliciously heartbroken; bookish rather than self-consciously literary; and marked by subtle strains of postwar Americana, which flourished on 2006’s Let’s Get Out of This Country, a clear turning point. John Henderson, who sang a lot on the first two records, left the band, and Campbell took center stage. Over two more albums, her lilting, aching songs carried the band’s relatability over into a color-drenched land of high fidelity, where it flushed with big studio strings and horns, embracing bubblegum rock, orchestral pop, beach music, and, especially, country and western from the altars of Patsy, Tammy, and Dolly. There were many reasons to be optimistic about Look to the East, Look to the West, the Scottish band’s first album in 11 years. They had gone out in top form on 2013’s Desire Lines, which I slightly underrated then but grew to adore. Key creators of their ferny, silvery sound were still in place—including McKeeve, bassist Gavin Dunbar, and drummer Lee Thomson—and Lander’s former role was ably taken up by Donna Maciocia. But the emotional charge in anticipation of the new album came from the fact that their story had been left unfinished so suddenly and cruelly. This wasn’t a comeback; it was catharsis, and the only question was whether or not time had faded Tracyanne Campbell's gifts: her rumpled-classic songwriting, unerring instinct for melodic embellishment, and the long green meadows of her voice. The record’s opening moments seem designed to allay those concerns straightaway. On “Liberty Print,” Campbell unleashes a tiered, fountaining run and then starts stringing out her fluted phrases like soft pearls. Wafting on a bed of sparkling doo-wop, they sound instantly familiar and washed in fond associations, but the hissing drum machine is something new, and the band finds a similar balance of good memories and fresh energies on each song. Guitar leads and bass-led grooves are more prominent, and each member seems to have more space to breathe and shine. The worst you could say about any prior Camera Obscura album was that it had highs so blinding they threw a slight shade on other great tunes—the “French Navy” conundrum. But their latest is their most consistent yet, and it stands among their best. Look to the East, Look to the West, which reunites the band with two-time producer Jari Haapalainen, clears away the orchestral elements to make room for both more electronic textures—drum machines, quirky or period guitar effects—and a deeper country palette of piano, pedal steel, and starry Hammond organ. Sometimes things are as simple as the lead single, “Big Love,” a bounding, winsome slice of California country rock, but “Only a Dream” swaps the band’s usual guitar reverb for a tremolo delay that ripples with concentric rings, recalling the spacey gardens of the similarly named Cranberries song. A pair of stunners called “Sleepwalking” and “Sugar Almond,” the latter written to Lander, make you wonder why Campbell doesn’t do solo piano ballads more often, with such an ideally structured but expressive voice for it. “Denon” seems to be concocted from the baroque pop of Pet Sounds and the Christine McVie side of Fleetwood Mac, that agile, tripping-along sense of melody. It evinces—alongside “We’re Gonna Make It in a Man’s World,” cowritten with Maciocia—what it’s tempting to call a newfound sense of confidence: “Hey, it’s all right if you find me trite,” Campbell sings. “The lines on my face are clear and in sight.” But really, though it might fly under the radar because of all the charming postures and mooning over sailors, she’s always talked this way. The chorus of the first song on her first record laid it down: “I know where I stand/I don’t need you to hold my hand.” That sense of no-nonsense centeredness amid the painful confusion of life and love has always been Camera Obscura’s heart, and it still beats here. Campbell is a distinctive lyricist in the way she goes wandering through effective cliches, striking  images, slices of life, and funny demotic phrases, and just as casually turns up stand-alone lines that you never forget along the way. My favorite ever is “Now my door has swollen from the rain,” from “Books Written for Girls.” The line that stands out here is in “Baby Huey (Hard Times),” one of the best and most adventurous new looks, a stretchy electro-pop taffy in the vein of the Blow’s classic “True Affection.” Over a gently switching acoustic guitar, Campbell sings, “The chaos of summer has died,” seeming to enfold everything that has been irrevocably lost while awakening to everything still to be found, in the autumn and winter of life, when the proportions of things grow clearer. Look to the East, Look to the West reminds us of better times while making it possible to believe the best is yet to come. Correction: An earlier version misidentified Kenny McKeeve as the principal singer on the band’s first two records. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Brijean,Macro,7.5,Electronic,"A solid groove can be a gateway to the sublime. When the rhythm section locks in just right, it triggers a profound physiological response: As your hips move and head bobs, cortisol levels drop, replaced with a blissful rush of dopamine. Time may start to lose its shape, marked only by the throb of a kick or tick of a hi-hat. Songs throughout the ages have spoken to the ecstasy of getting lost in music, celebrating the ways that dancing can make one’s troubles vanish and wipe the emotional slate clean. Brijean Murphy understands this transformative power. She’s long been an in-demand live and session percussionist, bolstering the pulse of artists like Mitski, Toro y Moi, Poolside, and U.S. Girls. After years of playing for hire, Murphy realized that the freelance life was losing its sustainability. With the encouragement of friends and her partner, multi-instrumentalist and producer Doug Stuart, she began recording her own songs. Since 2018, the duo of Murphy and Stuart (operating under Murphy’s first name, à la Sade), has been making warm, lightly psychedelic dance music that weaves together bits of tropicália, Latin jazz, house, disco, and dream pop, placing emphasis on Murphy’s command of undulating rhythms. Macro, their fourth and most ambitious album, is a seductive invitation to boogie on the astral plane. Brijean’s debut, 2018’s Walkie Talkie, was set deep in the tropics, but they’ve never stayed in one place for long. On each successive release the duo has sharpened its pop instincts, adding instruments and collaborators, and widening its scope beyond easy genre tags. Macro’s swooning arrangements bloom and bend, revealing a band comfortable with experimenting within the boundaries of a certain sound. The Vancouver bounce of “Counting Sheep” morphs into stoned lounge music with the addition of a syncopated triangle. A sound collage briefly interrupts the ’60s mod swing of “Bang Bang Boom,” setting up the swirling psych of the song’s jammy coda. They’ve maintained a mimosa-and-CBD-gummy chill that gently nods at the sun-drunk, day-glo jams Murphy’s collaborators in Poolside make, but Brijean’s work has more depth. Even at their most billowing, these songs maintain a slight edge, an understanding that it’s easier to get to a place of cathartic release when your muscles are already tense. Twenty-five seconds into “Euphoric Avenue,” Murphy coos a sincere concern: “All I know is time moves much too fast.” Lightly picked guitar, synthesized strings, and ringing chimes run together as her words descend, leaving a vapor trail of reverb in their wake. Such a definitive, almost anxious phrase seems at odds with the pleasant instrumental fog that surrounds it, but as soon as Murphy intones the word “fast,” a waltzing bossa nova drum beat snaps to life, bongos rippling behind it. On “Breathe,” a plea for slowing down, Murphy asserts that she wants “to do more things that don’t take currency.” Her silvery voice uncurls over the lush but jittery breakbeat soundscape; the song is governed by an existential tug between ecstatic abandon and the looming dread of waking up the same as you ever were. “Workin’ On It,” Macro’s first single and arguable centerpiece, is giddy, iridescent roller disco. The classic hallmarks are there: Stuart plays a walking bassline, open hi-hats accent the upbeats, and tension builds to the occasional, emphatic “woo!” You’d expect a song like this to be titled “Work It Out” or some similarly sweaty encouragement. But strange touches like Murphy’s dry, upfront vocals and the textured delay radiating from the title phrase, give the song a more interior feeling. When Murphy sings about her desire for “depth and complexity,” the infectious groove feels like an invitation to get lost in self-discovery. You’re made to feel it all; your shaking legs, beating heart, and swimming thoughts are all part of the same dance. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Bill Callahan,Resuscitate!,7.8,Rock,"One of the words that Bill Callahan uses most frequently on Resuscitate!, a live album recorded in March 2023, is “dreams.” We’re coming in and out of them on “First Bird.” They’re places of transmogrification, danger, and in fact the ultimate reality on “Coyotes.” “Dream, baby, dream,” Callahan seems to ad lib on “Natural Information,” a song about pushing his infant daughter down the street, now reinforced with the greatest lesson this wised-up dad could ever teach her. It’s 11 years since Callahan released his 15th album, Dream River, a record he intended to be the last thing the listener heard at night, guiding them tenderly to their sleep state. Since then, marriage, fatherhood, and a new embrace of expansive thinking have taken the 58-year-old songwriter to a whole other metaphysical plane. I often think of beautiful coincidences as being like an eclipse—two celestial bodies lining up for just a second that you’re lucky enough to catch—and Callahan has become a stargazer for those moments in his writing, especially as he observes the habits of his young family; his melodies, too, have become more open, transcendent, reaching for something beyond. That night at Chicago’s Thalia Hall, Callahan and his band attained a sort of dream state, sounding generative and otherworldly. “The date was mid-point in the tour,” Callahan writes in the accompanying notes, “so I knew we’d be as hot as we were going to get. Not too green, not too brown.” (He also notes that he tries to work only with venues, such as Thalia Hall, outside the Live Nation/Ticketmaster nexus, and maybe that freedom wriggles in.) In opening song “First Bird” alone, Callahan, guitarist Matt Kinsey, tenor sax player Dustin Laurenzi, and drummer Jim White voyage further than most bands ever do in a whole set. It starts off sounding like a mysterious night on the plains, full of skittish life forms, prowling bass, flashes of woodwind. As Callahan grows more fervent, the instruments vibrate with anticipation, and then come to tumble in and out of sync with their leader’s mercurial, deeply felt phrasing. It peaks with Callahan cawing “Tall! Tall! Tall!,” as if he were that titular first bird; after six minutes, the squalling guitar propels a full-band tumbledown climax. Even though parts of this ensemble have been playing together for a long time—and any group with White as its center has magic on its side—the telepathy between them is astonishing. I saw Callahan in London at the outset of this run, in November 2022, and as a veteran fan, it was perhaps my least favorite show of his that I’ve seen. The setlist dwelled largely on his post-pandemic records, as this night in Chicago did, with scant exceptions. I love YTI⅃AƎЯ and Gold Record as much as the next person who loves joy, but why forsake your sweet Smog children! The playing was so digressive—the version of “Coyotes” on Resuscitate! lasts nearly 13 minutes, and many others run to around seven minutes—that I rued what felt like indulgence standing in the way of the old classics. Yet it doesn’t feel that way on this album, and not simply because Callahan has trimmed the 15-song setlist at Thalia Hall that night to a tidier 10. The quality of the recording captures the glorious tumult in the band’s interplay, making it visceral and elemental: how Laurenzi’s sax shifts from arid to buttery on “Coyotes”; how the rhythm section is held back on “Drover,” as if by the song’s shepherd, then allowed to burst free. In Callahan’s notes, he described Chicago as “America’s heart,” and you can hear this band connecting its ’90s post-rock scene and contemporary jazz tendrils in their playing: “Naked Souls,” a lament about people grown dead inside, becomes a kind of spiritual, Callahan backed by the deep vocals of Pascal Kerong’A, and Natural Information Society’s Joshua Abrams and Lisa Alvarado join for “Natural Information” (surely named in tribute to their verdant jazz group), a puckish incantation that melts into a happy drone and softly nudging horns. Something else that keeps any potential sprawl in check is the sense that Callahan has had an awakening he fervently needs to transmit, as the name of this record suggests. He has a standup’s sense of timing, and with the combination of a knowing pause and his wise, wry voice, it’s not hard for him to get a laugh out of a little aside like “if I believed in souls—and such—and judgment day” on “Keep Some Steady Friends Around” (the only Smog/pre-2011 song played). On the waltzing “Pigeons,” in which he plays a chauffeur extolling the merits of marriage, he savors and deepens every syllable of “plenipotentiary,” almost as if he’s a little bashful at his enthusiasm, or maybe just doing his best Sam Elliott impression. But often his pauses seem less like someone priming for a laugh than a receiver waiting for the feeling to strike him: “Dreams are thoughts in lo-tus!” he exclaims on “First Bird,” as if the image has just blossomed in his mind’s eye. Most revivifying are the moments where this man, usually still as a lake, becomes roiled by feeling: “I’m your loverloverloverloverloverloverloverloverloverlover man!” he exalts on “Coyotes,” breathless with ecstasy. On the recorded version of “Partition,” his instruction to “Microdose!/Change your clothes!/Do what you got to do/To see the picture” is a vivid suggestion. But here, it sounds like a racing insurrection against stasis: Callahan at his most cataclysmic, Kinsey stabbing at his fretboard, the band in a sort of junkyard tailspin that even encompasses a brief broken funk interlude. Like all the wildest dreams, you sense they couldn’t recreate this glorious mess if they tried—but its suggestion to venture beyond knowledge, and to trust what you find there, is eye-opening.

Sabrina Carpenter,Short n’ Sweet,8.0,Pop/R&B,"Across the long history of music, love has been likened to every drug under the sun. But on this summer’s intoxicating breakout hit, Sabrina Carpenter claims to be so irresistible that it pushes her lovers to the edge of insomnia. “Is it that sweet? I guess so,” she coos on “Espresso,” eyelash extensions fluttering innocently. “Say you can’t sleep, baby I know, that’s that me espresso.” Her allure is so piping hot that it melts grammar down into something deliciously dumb and maybe genius. Atop a breezy nu-disco beat, Carpenter delivers nonsensical, syntax-shredding lines—“Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya”…“I know I Mountain Dew it for ya”—with the “yoo-hoo” cheek of a Gen Z Betty Boop. “Espresso” and its even more successful follow-up single, “Please Please Please,” launched the 25-year-old Carpenter into a new echelon of pop stardom. It's been a long time coming. She spent her teenage years acting in a spin-off of the sitcom Boy Meets World and she released her first four records under the Disney umbrella. Like many before her, she eventually ditched the mouse ears to drop her first “big girl” album, 2022’s Emails I Can’t Send. So here we are at Carpenter’s sixth album, Short n’ Sweet, a tee-hee title for a 36-minute album by a singer who stands just under five feet tall. In a pop landscape recently plagued by self-seriousness and a tiresome obsession with authenticity, Short n’ Sweet is a refreshing glass of escapism. Rest assured, Carpenter didn’t bunny hop over a vulnerable phase—Emails touched on a number of personal experiences including breakups, parental infidelity, and the fallout from a love triangle involving a certain “driver’s license.” But on Short n’ Sweet, Carpenter is here for a good time. As she establishes on the opening track, “Taste”: “Singin’ ’bout it don’t mean I care.” Across 12 tracks, Carpenter plays with some familiar pop guises. There’s sparkly pop-rock (the semi-sapphic “Taste”), Dolly-indebted twang (“Slim Pickins,” “Sharpest Tool”), and at least one throwback R&B steamer (“Good Graces”). Though “Coincidence”’s singalong vibes step a little too close to the folk-pop campfire, Carpenter largely pulls off these stylistic crossovers thanks to a big-ass voice that she wields with ease. It also helps that she’s backed by a who’s-who of pop songwriters and producers. Short n’ Sweet’s primary co-writer is Amy Allen, who has many hits under her belt including four No. 1 songs this year. Other familiar names include Julia Michaels, One Direction mastermind John Ryan, and Ian Kirkpatrick. Jack Antonoff is here too—his sparkly synths are unmistakable on the dazzling “Please Please Please.” If the sound of Short n’ Sweet is occasionally fuzzy, its sense of humor is diamond-sharp. Carpenter stays busy finding novel ways to reference premature ejaculation and pervert therapy speak (“You’re holding space for her tongue in your mouth” is a particularly memorable one.) Short n’ Sweet’s casually goofy sex positivity is essential to its charm. On “Bed Chem,” she lays the innuendo on thick while winking at her romance with a certain Irish actor. “Come right on me, I mean camaraderie,” she deadpans over sexy honeymoon synths. But the standout “Juno” takes it further. Atop a roller rink gloss, Carpenter reimagines the teen pregnancy plot of the 2007 indie film as seductive shorthand: “I might let you make me Juno.” In case that reference went over any heads, she then steps out from behind the double entendres and sings: “I’m so fuckin’ horny!” Unfortunately it’s dry out there, and Carpenter spends most of Short n’ Sweet reporting from the miserable front lines of modern dating. That boy who didn't know the difference between “there,” “their,” and “they are”? At least he makes for a good laugh. And who can blame a girl for getting her kicks where she can? Sometimes you have to sit on a face to shut a guy up! Carpenter doesn’t pretend like her own dating history isn’t full of himbos—if Short n’ Sweet had a subtitle it might be: Men Are Stupid…But So Am I. “I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste,” she sings on “Please Please Please” before calling this judgment into question: “It’s funny and it’s ironic that only I feel that way.” But the rare moments when Carpenter’s “give a fucks” return from vacation, if you will, are compelling. On the downcast ballad “Dumb & Poetic,” she excoriates a familiar type of guy who thinks that a meditation practice absolves him from fuckboy tendencies (Leonard Cohen also catches another stray—please let this man rest). But on the album’s penultimate track, “Lie to Girls,” Carpenter emerges from a relationship having learned a hard truth, that emotional abuse can be self-perpetuated. “You don’t have to lie to girls/If they like you, they’ll just lie to themselves,” she sings. “Like you, they’ll just lie to themselves.” Anyone is capable of breaking a heart and sometimes, you’re cruelest with your own. But Carpenter has a simple request: If you’re gonna break hers, please, do it gently. A good dick joke can’t hurt either. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Paris Paloma,Cacophony,6.8,Pop/R&B,"In 2022, fledgling Derbyshire musician Paris Paloma entered a professional studio for the first time and recorded “Labour,” a big, theatrical statement about the contradictory expectations placed on women in heterosexual relationships. In a clip that went viral on TikTok, simmering frustration with gender roles boils over: “All day, every day/Therapist, mother, maid/Nymph then a virgin/Nurse then a servant.” Paloma’s full-length debut, Cacophony, bears the fruits of years of “Labour,” expanding on that song’s feminist themes through lush alt-pop and endless vocal layering. In virtually every interview, Paloma names Florence and the Machine and Hozier as formative influences; add an album structure loosely inspired by the hero’s journey, and Cacophony sounds too ambitious to pull off. But with a surprising depth in writing and production, the album often hits its lofty goals. Paloma and producer Justin Glasco were already at work well before “Labour” blew up, and from the opening song, it’s clear this record wasn’t made with TikTok metrics in mind. “My Mind (Now)” starts with a nearly incomprehensible a capella verse before Paloma gasps for air and all hell breaks loose: chiptune synths, menacing synth bass, and Paul Frith’s dramatic trumpet fanfares. Paloma’s formidable voice, controlled but expressive, is the calm in the storm. The rest of Cacophony isn’t as cacophonous, but even the quieter tracks are packed full of dense vocal production—the auto-panned backing vocals on Paloma’s self-produced “Pleaser” and the formant-shifted counterpoint on “Bones on the Beach” add to the sense of restless unease. Though she’s not the first person to tackle this subject matter, Paloma roots it in earthy imagery and personal anecdote. Highlight “Boys, Bugs, and Men” traces the logical conclusion of “boys will be boys”-style apologia from little kids squashing insects to grown men enacting violence with impunity: “I see hunger/Looking for a sign/That any of your destruction had me suffering inside/It fills you with light/To take away mine.” On “Last Woman on Earth,” the record’s darkest point, Paloma fears even death won’t provide release. Alluding to Hugh Hefner’s interment next to Marilyn Monroe, she asks that her body be fed to animals instead—a morbid but understandable request in the year of the man-or-bear debate. “His Land” is the one time she overreaches: Atop ’90s new age piano and schmaltzy strings, overstuffed lines like “The lake that he gatekeeps/Yet I know not what for” wind up a misguided mix of modern and antiquated syntax. Amid the righteous anger, Paloma finds room for more lighthearted moments. She’s surprisingly tongue-in-cheek on “Drywall” as she flips the stereotype of the overly emotional woman back on a volatile man who’s putting holes in the walls (“Eggshell temperament/No emotional regulation/Hysterical baby”). Two tracks before “Last Woman on Earth,” “Triassic Love Song” is an unexpectedly sweet paleontology ballad about the Triassic Cuddle, a prehistoric fossil in which a protomammal and an amphibian intertwine. Even “Boys, Bugs, and Men” disguises its social commentary in breezy pop. The battle of light and dark reaches its apotheosis on “Bones on the Beach,” concluding with the record’s simplest and most powerful line: “Death won’t bring what you think it will.” Individually, these songs are clever, moving snapshots that often equal Paloma’s musical inspirations. Taken as a whole, though, Cacophony leans too heavily on an us-vs.-them mentality. A pair of songs about camaraderie among women (“Knitting Song” and “As Good a Reason”), while lovely, threaten to oversimplify the album’s narrative into evil men and pure women. The problem with blowing everything up to mythological proportions is that there isn’t room for gray areas. No record can single-handedly untangle centuries of patriarchal oppression; Cacophony still makes a valiant attempt. Even as she develops her voice, Paloma is able to think deeply about gender without moralizing or condescending to her audience. She taps into genuine, conflicted feelings about womanhood that are, for better or worse, timeless.",0,"August 30, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/paris-paloma-cacophony/
The Get Up Kids,Something to Write Home About (25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition),7.6,Rock,"A truly great opening line is rare; the best stick around long after you’ve forgotten the finer details of whatever follows. “In 1984, I was hospitalized for approaching perfection.” “Desperate for changing, starving for truth.” “It’s Britney, bitch.” It’s rarer still to find it from a band whose most successful songs until that point rhymed “you” with, well, “you.” But in 1999, the Get Up Kids were on a mission to break out of their isolated scene in Kansas City. Their second album opens with a pick slide, and then another for good measure, before vocalist Matt Pryor asks a question with the bewilderment of a man in the twilight of his teens: “What became of everyone I used to know?” It’s hard to imagine that album, Something to Write Home About, without its explosive introduction. In an instant, it defines the ethos of so many third-wave emo bands that would form in its wake: adolescent drama stoked into a theatrical wildfire, with layered guitars and Pryor’s pinched, melodic howl as its kindling. But early demos of that song, the electric barnstormer “Holiday,” reveal a shocking alternate universe where the album opens differently: “See you every year and yet we don't embrace.” (There’s also only one pick slide. Yeesh!) On a new reissue of the band’s breakout record, which includes a remaster of the original tracklist as well as a dozen demos from the time of its recording, the Get Up Kids take a roundabout path to pop, achieving emo greatness through careful revision. From their inception, the Get Up Kids were unabashedly ambitious. Pryor had already fronted two failed bands and wasn’t going to risk missing on his third shot at success. Today, an artist might attempt to start a viral TikTok dance to promote their music, but it was 1996, so the Get Up Kids did the only thing they could: They sent demo cassettes to every rock label listed in the pages of Billboard’s Musician’s Guide to Touring and Promotion. The label that responded to their cold submission, Doghouse, might have later inspired one of the blunter anti-label screeds of that decade, but hey, a deal’s a deal. By the following year, the band opened for emo forebears like Braid and Jimmy Eat World and released their full-length debut, Four Minute Mile, recorded (for $4,000, by Shellac bassist Bob Weston) in one weekend so that drummer Ryan Pope wouldn’t miss school. Even if that album had the rawness you might expect from an Electrical Audio disciple—full of tape hiss and unedited live takes, a record that guitarist Jim Suptic would later describe as “a missed opportunity”—the band’s maudlin anxieties and sugary hooks couldn’t help but emerge from the wreckage. After their contract with Doghouse lapsed, they fielded offers from Sub Pop, Geffen, and “probably every major label you can name,” as Ryan put it at the time, and landed on relative newcomer Vagrant. With their own Heroes & Villains imprint and a month of studio time in Los Angeles with producer Chad Blinman on the books, they started piecing together their follow-up. The 1999 album’s original recordings, remastered for this reissue, still sound both singular and prophetic for the shape of emo to come. Pryor’s lyrics embody the way teenage relationships can feel huge and trivial at once: Summer didn’t just pass them by—on “Close to Home” it “swallowed us whole.” On “Long Goodnight,” he writes like an endearingly overeager AP English student in one line (”Lest I forget”) before insisting, “I’m not bitter, anyway,” in the next. The album takes its palm-muted riffs as seriously as its delicate piano ballads. “I’m a Loner, Dottie, a Rebel” imagines a world where multiple time signatures and headbanging breakdowns coexist symbiotically, the former doubling the intensity of the latter. Something to Write Home About framed the everyday problems of entering adulthood with the intensity of Victorian drama, performed with the zeal of a band who wasn’t going to miss another opportunity in the studio. The demos included in the reissue offer hints of other paths the group could have taken. The band was already well on its way to the poppier side of KROQ’s rotation when James Dewees, a drummer for Kansas City metalcore outfit Coalesce, joined as the band’s keyboardist in 1998. Their final EP on Doghouse, Red Letter Day, had ended with what sounds in retrospect like a hint of things to come: On “Mass Pike,” Dewees taps out a clinking melody on the piano while a drum machine whirrs to life in the background. Whether or not they knew they were adding an Amadeus-loving pianist when they brought him on (Dewees had come to their attention for throwing a drum kit into the audience), the Get Up Kids’ second album would be indelibly marked by his chirping synths and piano runs. His impact—not only on the band’s sound, but on the sound of emo descendents like the Anniversary and Motion City Soundtrack—is starkly revealed in its absence: An early full-band demo of “Ten Minutes” included in the reissue sounds hollow without Dewees’ grounding melodies. Absent its opening piano, a 4-track recording of “The Company Dime” is charmingly humble but thin, just layers of guitar and Pryor’s voice, worlds away from the expansive version that ended up on the album. Elsewhere, the demos reveal iterations of the band’s writing process: The original demo for “Valentine” stumbles through what Pryor called a “twangy” guitar riff before getting to the lamentations in its verses. For the final version, the band chose an intro that, with a close listen, recalls the Red Letter Day cut “Anne Arbour”: a bluesy step down the piano’s scale, backed by the drum of a military march. These demos unfurl the band’s parallel histories: For diehard fans, they reveal the unsteady process that yielded triumphant choruses, the false turns that could have cost them their shot at the big leagues. For those who, like so many critics, saw each refinement of their sound as a rebuke of punk values, it traces the dark path towards a brighter sound, one that would finally betray the band on its sluggish and melodramatic 2002 follow-up, On a Wire. On its 25th anniversary, Something to Write Home About leaves a mixed legacy. It ushered in a cohort of even younger and brattier bands who would go on to define emo’s next decade—you can thank the Get Up Kids for the new-wave headaches of Hellogoodbye. At the same time, it’s a high-water mark for the band and the genre, a collection of surprisingly potent vignettes of Midwestern quarter-life ennui performed by a group of deceptively seasoned musicians. Upon its release, the record was criticized for sounding too commercial—but if you heard an early demo of Jimmy Eat World’s Clarity as you were getting ready to record your next album, wouldn’t you try to step up your game too? On “Action & Action,” Pryor might be talking about their own ambitions when he sings, “Overexposure is the key,” and then, “I finally found/The right formula.” These demos, where the band tweaks a riff here or a moves verse there, reveal the magic in their punk-to-pop alchemy.

Art Ensemble of Chicago,Nice Guys,9.5,Experimental / Jazz,"On May 8, 1965, a group of musicians gathered at a house on the South Side of Chicago. They’d been summoned there, via postcards mailed out by four local peers, to discuss the founding of a new collective, devoted to generating fresh opportunities for artists engaged in what they called, simply, “creative music.” At one point during the meeting, a saxophonist named Gene Easton summed up the frustrations shared by many in attendance. “We’re locked up in a system,” he said, “and if you don’t express in the system that is known, you’re ostracized.” “But,” he added, “there are far better systems.” By this time, some prominent musicians had famously bucked mainstream jazz conventions, pursuing revolutions either subtle or splashy (see Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue and Ornette Coleman’s The Shape of Jazz to Come, respectively). But change in jazz still came with controversy: John Coltrane, for example, was alienating some critics and peers with an increasingly abstract style. For an average working jazz musician, especially outside the hotbed of New York, who wanted to keep gigging while also aspiring to engage with vanguard sounds—let alone one, who like some present at that 1965 South Side meeting, was wary of pledging allegiance to jazz, or any other style—it’s easy to see why open expression still felt risky. When Easton spoke of feeling “locked up,” he was talking in musical terms. But his desire to transcend creative restriction signified a higher purpose for the nascent Chicago collective, one that would open up new avenues for Black musicians seeking to thrive beyond category or genre. The group, which would soon dub itself the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, or AACM, would go on to have an immeasurable impact on the course of jazz, experimental music, contemporary classical, and other proudly unclassifiable styles, from the mid-’60s up through the present. A short list of the major artists to emerge from the AACM includes two Pulitzer Prize honorees (2016 winner Henry Threadgill and 2013 finalist Wadada Leo Smith), various NEA Jazz Masters (including Muhal Richard Abrams, the group’s co-founder and longtime musical and intellectual anchor, as well as Anthony Braxton, Amina Claudine Myers and Threadgill) and younger luminaries such as Nicole Mitchell, guitarist Jeff Parker, and cellist Tomeka Reid. But of all the musicians ever to carry the flag for the organization’s better system, perhaps none embodied its core principles of limitless aesthetics, self-determination, and solidarity among individuals more aptly than Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, Malachi Favors, and Lester Bowie, early members who eventually joined forces as the Art Ensemble of Chicago. If the AACM is a galaxy, worthy of a lifetime of study—and to anyone looking for a star map, A Power Stronger Than Itself, trombonist-composer and longtime member George Lewis’s 2008 critical history, the source for the meeting excerpt quoted above, is essential—the Art Ensemble are at least a planet, or more accurately a solar system, given their wealth of satellite projects. Their discography, spanning over 40 albums for more than 15 labels across 50-plus years, can be tough to penetrate. Early recordings from before the group settled on its collective identity—such as Sound, a stunningly assured 1966 album released under Mitchell’s name—are key, as are the wealth of LPs the band made in France after temporarily relocating there in 1969. Another high point: Fanfare for the Warriors, a 1973 Atlantic set that reunited the members with their mentor Abrams. But the Art Ensemble reached an apex during their roughly six-year initial association with ECM, the German label whose pristine sonics and diverse roster helped to define the sound of ’70s jazz, which kicked off with an album that’s both staunchly uncompromising and about as inviting as avant-garde music gets, bearing the unassuming title Nice Guys. In some ways, the record feels like a manifesto, setting forth the cornerstones of the group’s musical and conceptual agenda. The back cover features a photo of the quintet set up in Ludwigsburg, Germany’s Tonstudio Bauer, facing one another, with their gear sprawling across the room. We see each musician with his primary instrument—saxophones for Mitchell and Jarman, trumpet for Bowie, bass for Favors and drums for Don Moye, who had joined as a full-time member in 1970—but also visible are mallet keyboards in the center of the room, and, next to Favors, a table full of what the group called “little instruments,” gongs, tambourines, shakers and assorted horns that each member wielded at various times. In the bottom right are two key bits of text, spelling out both the group’s proud hometown affiliation—“The Art Ensemble of Chicago is an AACM group”—and its mission statement: “Great Black Music—Ancient to the Future.” That regal phrase, coined by Bowie and Favors in the late ’60s as a motto for the AACM as a whole and later augmented by Favors, contained multitudes. First, it was a gesture of self-worth. “We want to avoid the stigma of jazz,” Bowie said of the term in an interview quoted in Paul Steinbeck’s valuable 2017 Art Ensemble biography Message to Our Folks. “When you say ‘jazz,’ it means, ‘uh-oh’: You’re the lowest paid guys on the concert, you have the worst hotel, you’re the least respected. The name ‘Great Black Music’ generates more respect.” Second, it was a statement on aesthetics. The group’s members had all come up through a rich array of musical traditions: Favors and Mitchell in their family’s churches and at clubs around Bronzeville, the vibrant South Side neighborhood that served as the center of Black cultural life in Chicago during the Great Migration; Jarman soaking up gospel and jazz at home and studying at Chicago’s DuSable High with legendary music educator Captain Walter Dyett; and Bowie learning from his father, a renowned band director, growing up in St. Louis. They embraced the current jazz vanguard, especially the work of Ornette Coleman, but for them an engagement with the new didn’t entail a rejection of what came before, or what they still heard around them. Their 1969 album Message to Our Folks featured interpretations of the gospel staple “Old Time Religion” and the Charlie Parker bebop standard “Dexterity” as well as the overtly James Brown-esque “Rock Out.” During the same era, the group also collaborated on an avant-garde funk tune with Fontella Bass, the hit-making R&B singer behind “Rescue Me” and Bowie’s then-wife. “Rhythm & blues; rock and roll; spirituals; swing; Dixie; reggae; bebop; funk—all these things are available to us as practitioners of Great Black Music,” Jarman later said in an interview with the writer Martin Johnson. Moreover, the musicians found the rapidly crystallizing aesthetics of East Coast free jazz, which often favored a roiling intensity, to be limiting. Released in a period where John Coltrane and his New York disciples like Albert Ayler and Pharoah Sanders were pushing toward fiery, ecstatic maximalism, Mitchell’s Sound LP provided a subtle yet firm counterpoint, making potent use of negative space and contrasting austere improvising with a playful, almost vaudevillian spirit. “Chicago developed a school that was totally different from the New York school,” Mitchell said in an interview with George Lewis. “The main difference was that we would stop,” Bowie answered when Lewis asked him about this distinction. “We had rests. We had whole notes. We were dealing with some melodies.” The Art Ensemble also had its own striking visual identity, on full display across Nice Guys. On the inside sleeve, we see each of the musicians preparing for a performance, which for some of the members involved, as Moye once put it, “colorful, African, Third World type of projections,” manifesting in face paint and eye-catching outfits. In the drummer’s words, these visual elements activated a stage-ready mindset, helping him to “evolve up to a high enough level to deal with the music.” (Likewise, in the mid-‘70s, Moye adopted the name Famoudou from a Guinean drummer he admired, while Favors took the surname Maghostus in tribute to both an Egyptian deity and a pharaoh.) But on the front, these five world-renowned musical iconoclasts are simply chilling out with some coffee, conversation, and a newspaper. From the ceremonial to the casual, all modes were welcome at the Art Ensemble’s table. Musically, the album’s 44 beautifully eclectic minutes sent a similarly inclusive message. On Bowie-penned opener “Ja” the group demonstrates with enchanting ease how comfortable they were swirling together their many influences and strategies. Starting with a restless blur of sound, the musicians settle into a pensive theme that could almost be a Nino Rota soundtrack excerpt. Whimsical whistles and touches of sound-effect percussion add an aura of playful surreality. Then, around two and a half minutes in, the scene changes dramatically as a quick Moye fill leads the band into a loping reggae groove. Joseph Jarman enters on lead vocal, adopting a Jamaican accent as he sings the “story of a man I know, coming from St. Louis,” who—as Bowie had actually done for around a year in the mid-’70s—settles in rural Portland Parish, Jamaica, but has to leave to follow his path as a global ambassador of Great Black Music. Favors and Moye dig deep into the song’s swaying rhythm, as Jarman and Mitchell’s saxophones form a rich backdrop, and Bowie alternates between big brassy blasts and softer variations on the melody. There’s virtuosity at work here, sure, but the overall effect here is like attending an easygoing beach party. If “Ja” showcases the Art Ensemble’s reverent but slyly radical approach to genre, “Folkus,” a lengthy piece by Moye, demonstrates how adept they were at dealing with pure sound. It builds slowly from a spare invocation to a kind of aural traffic jam, where Bowie’s trumpet and various horns converse in overlapping cries and honks. Then comes an eerie percussion interlude centered around vibes, gongs, chimes, mallet-struck drums and eventually what sounds like distorted, amplified voice. Near the end, the group shifts gears, becoming a tightly orchestrated drum choir, playing an interlocking rhythmic pattern. Despite its abstract, intuitive structure, the work feels entirely intentional, a document of five musicians working together to conjure a series of distinct moods. The vividness of the recording—by Martin Wieland, who also engineered dozens of other ECM classics, from Pat Metheny’s Bright Size Life to Don Cherry and Ed Blackwell’s El Corazón—brings you closer to the heart of the group’s world than on any other prior Art Ensemble document: You feel like you’re seated in the musicians’ midst as they enact a spellbinding sonic rite. Mitchell’s “Cyp” is another masterful abstract piece, where bursts of trumpet and daubs of saxophone ring out against stark silences. Jarman’s “597 - 59,” by contrast, is the album’s edgiest selection, moving from a tightly arranged multi-part theme to a vigorous, churning improv workout, the closest the record comes to the so-called New York school of free jazz. Mitchell’s title track too is something entirely different, a swinging, lushly arranged miniature, not worlds apart from early ’50s cool jazz, bookended by a melodica drone, chattering horns, and a lighthearted spoken proclamation: “They’rrre soooo niiiice.” On closer “Dreaming of the Master,” a simple bluesy riff penned by Jarman, we hear the group in classicist mode, offering up Great Black Music in the mode of their forebears, with Bowie’s trumpet solo—played partly with a mute and partly without—strongly evoking the Miles Davis of around 20 years prior. Jarman’s tenor leads the band through one more hurtling freeform sprint before they close with a sublimely chill recapitulation of the theme, emphasizing once more that the Art Ensemble could inhabit any of its chosen musical zones, from the most reverent to the most radical, with total authority. More than four decades on from Nice Guys, following the deaths of Bowie, Favors, and Jarman, the Art Ensemble still persists, as Mitchell and Moye have enlisted various younger artists, including the prominent poet and cross-genre experimentalist Moor Mother, as well as AACM members Nicole Mitchell, Tomeka Reid and bassist Junius Paul. Still, its lineage can be hard to trace. In recent years, as the music and aesthetics of John and Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders have been widely feted and emulated in a new wave of spiritual jazz, clear descendants of the Art Ensemble are far less common. (A few who have built on aspects of their legacy include the Moor Mother-fronted Irreversible Entanglements, who favor a broad stylistic range, ritualistic performance style and strong historical grounding; Reid, Nicole Mitchell and drummer Mike Reed’s collective Artifacts Trio, a band explicitly dedicated to celebrating the past and present of AACM; and the late jaimie branch, known for her challenging yet celebratory brand of avant-gardism.) Taken as a whole, Nice Guys clearly shows that there was indeed a better system to be found, one that could allow its members to liberate themselves from constrictive forms, embracing both experimentation and, yes, tradition on their own terms. Great Black Music was serious, the album argued, a ritual you had to equip yourself for, but it could also be one hell of a good time. Pull up a chair at our table, the combination of music and image seemed to say. After all, we’rrre soooo niiiice.",0,"August 11, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/art-ensemble-of-chicago-nice-guys/
Sexyy Red,In Sexyy We Trust,7.5,Rap,"If you were hoping that the filthy, horny, sex-fueled shenanigans of Sexyy Red would forever be stuck in the summer of 2023, I have bad news for you. She’s got another one with In Sexyy We Trust. Sure, last year’s Hood Hottest Princess (damn-near all bangers) can’t be replicated, as part of the appeal was getting caught off guard and going from Oh, that song where she goes “My bootyhole is brown” is funny to Hold up, did she just drop one of the great rap mixtapes of the year? basically overnight. It was such a polarizing sensation that I wouldn’t have been surprised if her follow-up scaled up too much, in a quest to prove that Hood Hottest Princess wasn’t a flash in the pan. But thankfully, Sexyy does not give a fuck. You’re gonna’ get homages to Gucci Mane and Chief Keef, graphic sex jokes and puns, and vulgar-ass quotables required to be shouted anytime you have a drop of alcohol in your system. About half of the tracks on In Sexyy We Trust should be summer anthems. “She’s Back” is a full-throttle DJ set cheat code; if it was up to me I would ban Rihanna’s “Birthday Cake” from being the soundtrack of the cake-cutting and replace it with Sexyy’s “It’s My Birthday.” The St. Louis native has a flair for these fun and rowdy songs that feel nostalgic for Southern and Midwest rap of the past without being pure pastiche. A good example of that is the lead single “Get It Sexyy,” where she howls a few Keef-inspired ad-libs and describes her physical attributes with more detail than an NFL draft scout, all in a hummable singsongy flow. Another is “Sexyy Love Money,” in which her verse starts off hot with an explosive, Waka Flocka-coded opening line (“Got my money up, bitch, I can’t act right”) and doesn’t let up. Her energy is cool yet so contagious that even a buzzkill guest appearance by Chicago drill newcomer VonOff1700 and a couple of punchline clunkers by her (“Higher than a motherfucker, eyes lookin’ like ching-chi”) don’t ruin the exquisite paycheck-hitting-your-bank-account-on-a-holiday-weekend vibe. Fame (going on tour with Drake, photo-ops with Lana Del Rey) hasn’t stopped Sexyy from saying whatever she wants. “Let’s go half on a baby, shoot the club up,” she raps casually on “Boss Me up,” as if she’s talking about splitting the bill at Applebee’s. On the cranked-up “Ova Bad” she blurts out the visual, “Drop and hit some splits, bitch, I wanna see that cameltoe.” Sometimes, though, the shock value can be a little try-hard. For one, the sexual moans on the chorus of “Outside,” the Brazilian funk-infused dud, are just annoying. Then, her duet with Lil Baby “Lick Me” wants to be freaky so bad, but they have such little chemistry that it’s more uncomfortable than sexy. But Sexyy Red’s worst chemistry is actually with Drake. Last year on Drake’s For All the Dogs, she stole the show with her New Orleans bounce-esque flow on “Rich Baby Daddy,” though he brought nothing to the table. Now on “U My Everything” he’s doing too much. It’s a silly, kind of sweet love song, her cracking melodies making it feel so earnest until Drake appears and instantly steamrolls the lovey-dovey mood by switching the soulful bounce to Metro Boomin’s A.I.-sampling (yawn) Drake-diss “BBL Drizzy.” It’s a troll-job, a way of signaling to Metro that he is unbothered. I do not care. Please, enough of this mid-life crisis rap beef, now it’s taking away the attention from Sexyy Red on a Sexyy Red mixtape, the worst thing you could do. Sexyy doesn’t need any of that fuss as long as she has her horndog bars and a thumping beat. Tay Keith’s instrumentals are nothing special, blending early 2010s ATL with modern Memphis bounce, but do a decent job of just giving her a blank, danceable canvas to run wild. And she does: From the stripped-down, trash-talking “Fake Jammin’” to the rattling “Awesome Jawsome,” where she comes up with countless different ways to get across that she’s getting head: “I’m on my period, it’s blood drippin’ down his face.” It would be kind of gross if it wasn’t funny, if she didn’t have so much personality, if I didn’t want to rap along. (OK, it still is kind of gross.) She’s no fad, she’s a rap star.",0,"June 3, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sexyy-red-in-sexyy-we-trust/
Tony Vaz,Pretty Side of the Ugly Life,7.6,Rock,"Nostalgia is a liar. As tempting as it may be to sink a half-hour scrolling through your saved photos or spend your morning commute trying to figure out what became of your sense of wonder, once the memory’s decayed it’s impossible to determine exactly what feeling it is you’re missing. On his solo debut, Pretty Side of the Ugly Life, Brooklyn singer-songwriter Tony Vaz documents this futile search for the missing piece, vicariously reliving his youth through classic rebel archetypes. Mixing elements of Midwest emo, alt-country, and early ’80s synth pop as if he’s rummaging through a theater wardrobe, Vaz plays the part of juvenile delinquent and itinerant beat poet. Though his mumbly, semi-spoken vocals and taste for lo-fi sound design are a constant, each track on Pretty Side feels like a distinct set piece that lasts for just one scene. The fidgety, fingerpicked electric guitar on “Your Purse or Your Life” and “Spin” evokes the headspace of a daydream going nowhere. In the vein of Joan of Arc, Vaz’s lengthy riffs hiccup and meander into parenthetical asides before resolving, acting as a harmonic mist amid country-fried pedal steel and flute. His presence on the mic enhances the feeling of unreality: Taking cues from Dean Blunt and jonatan leandoer96, he’s more voiceover artist than singer, half-snickering at himself as he chants, “You know we like that/Top down, new country with the seat back.” Multi-tracked backing vocal takes and guest appearances by Alena Spanger act as incidental background chatter, making the leftover space feel lived-in. When she and Vaz harmonize behind a dirt bike gang’s demand to fork over the bag, you can’t help but feel a little romantic about America’s infatuation with—and fear of—violent crime. “24 Hour Gang,” a bleary-eyed take on Technique-era New Order, grapples with the tension between Vaz’s real and imagined selves, interrupting his dreams of clubbing into the wee hours with a sober reminder that he needs to wake up early for an appointment the next day. As the reverie collapses, the song’s lean arrangement begins to unfurl into an elegant study in sophisti-pop cheese, dissolving shimmery synths and delayed saxophone into the atmosphere. Fun as fantasy may be, there’s comfort in knowing you can always return to the present. On “Field,” Vaz strips the arrangement down to just electric guitar, peeling back his songwriting’s escapist haze to reveal the disillusionment below. “Don’t feel right to be a regular guy,” he sings, admitting his struggle to stay present when much of his day consists of waiting in line and flitting between errands. Dreaminess in music is often equated with a state of bliss or crushing catharsis; Vaz’s dream pop features an undercurrent of emptiness, aware of the impending comedown. It’s a stolen moment zoned out in the checkout line—a figment of memory that materializes while stalled at a red light.",0,"October 4, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tony-vaz-pretty-side-of-the-ugly-life/
Sam Wilkes,iiyo iiyo iiyo,7.7,Jazz,"Sam Wilkes has tried on different identities in his career as an L.A. instrumental envelope-pusher: pop dabbler, on his 2018 debut, Wilkes; loop and beatmaker, on 2021’s Music for Saxofone and Bass Guitar, with frequent collaborator Sam Gendel; and instrumental iterator on 2021’s One Theme & Subsequent Iteration, among other releases. Wilkes is an explorer and a chameleon, reconfiguring his band from a cast of L.A. jazz and rock stalwarts for each successive project. Recorded live in 2022 at Kakegawa, Japan’s Festival de Frue and Tokyo club WWW X, iiyo iiyo iiyo is the culmination of these disparate efforts, the distillation of his years riffing, collaborating, and toying with jazz’s edges. When the festival booked Wilkes, a new configuration of session players took shape: a quintet featuring drummer Craig Weinrib (Henry Threadgill, Amen Dunes) and guitarist Dylan Day (Jenny Lewis, Jackson Browne), with whom Wilkes recently released a trio LP, along with keyboardist Chris Fishman (Pat Metheny, Louis Cole) and keyboardist/guitarist Thom Gill (KNOWER, Joseph Shabason), who represent what Wilkes calls a more “virtuosic, fast-paced” side of his music. This chimera of two groups seemed to spring from the ether, a misunderstanding no one actually suggested—Wilkes thought it was the festival’s idea, and they thought it was his—but was destined nonetheless. Its resulting sound, the product of one five-hour rehearsal, is similarly supernatural: plaintive, peripatetic, and full of wonder, journeyman’s jazz that’s as warm and saturated as a ’70s living room. “Descending (Frue),” the first of the record’s seven meandering songs (a different version featured on Wilkes’ 2018 debut), showcases Fishman’s nimble arpeggiated riffs on a Moog, a descent more like stepping into a conversation pit than anything perilously steep. Whether it’s the Los Angeles of it all or Wilkes’ experience composing music for the film Malcolm & Marie with Gendel, there’s a cinematic quality to the record that strengthens its trance-like grip. One can imagine the sweat beading on the players’ brows during the heightened end of “Rain & Snow,” or the eye contact that might help Weinrib and Wilkes lead the rest of the group through a slippery time change. Jazz is not a contact sport, necessarily, but here, it’s a collection of charged particles—you couldn’t splice together these sounds from a few stacked studio recordings. The songs are electrified by intimacy and time. “Rain & Snow” is the record’s most alchemical track, a locked-in groove that transcends even its own mighty parts. What begins as a shuffling plod builds steadily into wilder, more animal stuff as Wilkes’ sinuous basslines flit between Weinrib’s timekeeping, birdlike and vivacious. The song changes direction slyly, dipping briefly into a bossa nova rhythm before it cedes to a Bill Frisell-like guitar line around minute four. The trajectory takes the listener far beyond the expected planes of beauty and melody, even if those traits never quite disappear under the fug of synths and loops. The musicians follow their own invisible wavelength, the tempo dissolving briefly around minute seven only to reconstitute as the album’s funkiest, liveliest foot-tapping riff, held aloft on the duet between Wilkes’ bass and Day’s and Gill’s keyboard and guitar. Even “I Want to Be Loved,” the quintet’s baleful, Western take on a Dinah Washington standard, goes in unexpected and delightful directions—is that a faint whoop at the 30-second mark? Pedal steel like a desert dusk backlights a meandering electric guitar riff, kinetic against the steady rake of Weinrub’s brush on the snare. iiyo iiyo iiyo’s arrangements cast Wilkes’ songs in new constellations that balance the comfort of familiarity with the marvel of the unknown. Put one city’s most talented jazz heads in one room, on one stage, and what ensues is a continuous, origami-like folding and unfolding of forms—from the same old material, new and wondrous shapes.",0,"October 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sam-wilkes-iiyo-iiyo-iiyo/
The Smile,Cutouts,8.0,Rock,"I’ve never been in a beloved band with a near-immaculate discography, but I have to imagine that, at some point, the paralyzing pressure of making a new album—of knowing you risk bumming out fans and mucking up a perfect legacy—sucks some of the joy and spontaneity out of music-making. In other words: I get it, this whole Smile thing. Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood don’t want to spend four years obsessively laboring to complete a Radiohead album worthy of sitting next to A Moon Shaped Pool in your vinyl nook. They want to keep moving. Greenwood, the self-proclaimed “most impatient” member of Radiohead, once said he would prefer if “the records were 90 percent as good, but come out twice as often.” It’s in that spirit that the Smile, the little Radiohead spinoff that could, present their second album of 2024, cobbled together from the same sessions that produced Wall of Eyes but, like Amnesiac, too good to be dismissed as a bastard child. Compared with its predecessor, Cutouts is looser, funkier—a thrilling testament to the near-telepathic chemistry these three musicians have honed across two years of touring. The stage is where many of these songs first premiered: the pastoral brooder “Bodies Laughing” in May 2022, a mere day after the band wrote it, and “Colours Fly” the following month in Paris, where guest musician Robert Stillman—then playing sax, now on bass clarinet—triggered the song’s ascent into squealing free-jazz delirium. Greenwood’s omnivorous curiosity is a big theme here. “Colours Fly,” with its frantic Egyptian scales, reflects Greenwood’s recent immersion in Middle Eastern music, notably as a collaborator of Israeli musician Dudu Tassa, while the pillowy synth overture that opens the record, “Foreign Spies,” repurposes elements from Greenwood’s 2019 classical piece Horror vacui. Years ago, people snickered when Yorke formed a band with Flea, but the singer’s interest in counterbalancing his depressive tendencies with extremely sick grooves seems central to the Smile’s whole deal. He’s certainly found the guy for the job in Tom Skinner, a syncopation wizard behind the kit. Skinner anchors “Colours Fly” in an off-center 5/4 meter, underlines the burbling panic attack of “The Slip” with skittering hip-hop beats that resemble readymade sample packs, and gives us one of his most restlessly percolating grooves on the exhilarating “Eyes & Mouth,” another longtime live staple. Indeed, the only underwhelming tracks are those where Skinner is either sidelined (the aforementioned “Foreign Spies”) or reduced to thickets of auxiliary percussion (“Don’t Get Me Started”). Greenwood, meanwhile, remains committed to his life’s work of coming up with mangled guitar riffs that no human has ever played before. The YouTube guitar-tutorial guys are going to have fun with “Zero Sum,” a frenetic workout whose guitar shredding sounds a little like Buckethead auditioning for Lightning Bolt. A brass section augments the song’s jittery funk, while Yorke’s paranoid tech-world mutterings touch upon TED Talks, MasterClass, and repetitions of “Windows 95, Windows 95.” And Greenwood’s fretboard-strangling riff on “Eyes & Mouth” may sound like a second-cousin of “Thin Thing,” but sleuthing fans have traced it all the way back to Radiohead’s 2016 tour, when Greenwood played it during the cacophonic outro of “Talk Show Host.” (The Smile is nothing if not an adoption center for neglected Radiohead song sketches.) If Yorke is having the time of his life letting loose with the Smile, at least his lyrics remain consumed with dread. Cutouts touches on sociopolitical dread (“Foreign Spies”), late-capitalist dread (“Zero Sum”), climate-denial dread (“You're gonna bring the world down ’round your ears/While the temperature grows ugly,” he warns on “The Slip”), existential dread (“Instant Psalm”)—the works, basically. He may not deliver a regal epic on par with Wall of Eyes’ “Bending Hectic,” but Yorke still has the ability to pull a gorgeous piano ballad out of thin air like it’s nothing, and the lush, trembling “Tiptoe” is one for the ages. “We are just baggage with no label/You will find us in the rubble,” the singer croons in communion with the gentle swells of the London Contemporary Orchestra, offering a grim prophecy that could refer to any number of world-historical crises. We’re all going to be dirt in the ground soon enough. Might as well hurry up and make another record. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Dettinger,Intershop / Oasis,8.3,"Electronic Reviewed: May 9, 2024 Michael Mayer first encountered Olaf Dettinger in 1997, at a party in Bautzen, a small East German town halfway between Dresden and the Polish border. Dettinger played an opening set of battle-style Chicago hard house—a far cry from the mischievous minimal techno that Mayer had packed his crate with—and presented the visiting headliner with a demo tape of his productions. Mayer wasn’t wowed by the demo’s relatively straightforward club tracks, which paled in comparison to the squirrelly, idiosyncratic music that Mayer and his friends in Cologne—Wolfgang and Reinhard Voigt, Jürgen Paape, and Jorg Bürger, among others—were putting out via a tangled web of labels and an even more chaotic array of aliases, a network they’d established out of their hometown’s Delerium record store. The music wasn’t bad, Mayer told Dettinger, but he found the sound derivative and the choice of instruments—a standard array of Roland 303, 808, 909, and the like—predictable. Besides, he added, in Cologne they’d moved from drum machines to samplers, a shift that had opened up new possibilities in sound design. A few weeks later, another cassette turned up in Mayer’s mailbox. Dettinger hadn’t just gotten the memo; the new tape was so in line with the sounds coming out of Cologne that he might as well have been one of them. The boom-ticking beats were ruthlessly reduced, and they swam in a strange wash of filtered chords whose source was impossible to place. There was a clear affinity with the dub techno of Wolfgang Voigt’s Studio 1 project, but Dettinger’s peculiar mix of grungy sonics and crisp drums stood on its own. One song was particularly striking: It sampled the pastel swirl of “The Ghost Has No Name,” from the Cocteau Twins and Harold Budd’s 1986 album The Moon and the Melodies, provocatively mixing techno rhythms, ambient atmospheres, and pop melodies—precisely the blend at the heart of so much of the Cologne scene’s music. Mayer and his crew signed the tracks for their New Trance Atlantic label and ordered a test pressing. But before they could manufacture the EP, they made a fateful decision. The jumble of imprints had gotten out of hand. It was time to tie off the spiraling list of labels—New Trance Atlantic, Profan, Auftrieb, etc.—and bring all their projects under one roof: Kompakt. Following an inaugural EP from Jürgen Paape, a co-founder of the new enterprise, Dettinger’s Blond EP, originally slated as NTA017, became the second release on the new label, followed a few records later by Dettinger’s even more adventurous Puma. The two 12""s helped establish the fledgling outlet as the source of some of Germany’s most exciting dance music of the era. But Kompakt had yet another ace up their sleeves: Intershop, Dettinger’s debut album and the label’s inaugural full-length, which would follow Puma a month later, in May 1999. Newly remastered and reissued—and pressed on vinyl for the first time—Intershop captures Kompakt at a pivotal moment in its evolution, branching out from club 12""s into a new world of home-listening music. Dettinger had already flirted with ambient on the Cocteaus-sampling track on Blond; with Intershop (named after a state-run chain store in the former East Germany), he moved more decisively into an interzone between the dancefloor and cloud nine. (“We always loved ambient,” recalled Mayer of his reaction to the Intershop demo. “KLF’s Chill Out was a record where everyone inside Kompakt could sing every note. To include ambient into the world of Kompakt was just a logical step for us.”) The first track—untitled, like every single cut in Dettinger’s catalog—lays out the palette that set the album apart from its peers. His synthesizers have a blurry, liquid quality. The sub-bass is too low to register as anything other than a vague pressure welling up underneath. Sampled drum-machine hits flit backward and forward like windshield wipers. The gliding groove gives the impression of rolling ceaselessly ahead in slow motion; the tempo is an unhurried 100 beats per minute, though dub delay on the fogged-out snares and hi-hats adds a quickening sense of movement that keeps the groove from plodding. Where techno usually stomps, this aqueous opening salvo undulates. Across six more tracks, Intershop builds on that humble set of ideas in evocative and vividly tactile ways. Track two wreathes its chords in a halo of distortion that glows like hammered copper. Track three, a loping fusion of hip-hop and industrial dub, is shot through with what might be the rattle of a film projector, gravelly and unyielding. On track four, reversed drum hits and elliptical delay patterns combine to create a groove that seems to pull apart at the seams—a lumbering, intransigent cadence that goes to the heart of Dettinger’s unusual sense of rhythm. If his mysterious sound design—lo-fi, suggestive, always seeming to hide secrets beneath its mottled surface—ropes you in, the music’s emotional pull keeps you there. That’s particularly true of Intershop’s final two tracks. The penultimate cut is a loping dub sketch whose luminous melody flickers like a wraith in the woods; in the closing track, a handful of piano notes run through a delay chain that slips increasingly out of phase, swirling like water going down the drain. It is one of the simplest songs I’ve ever heard; on some days, I’m pretty sure it’s also the saddest. Six months after Intershop, Dettinger returned to the dancefloor with the bruising, bewilderingly left-footed Totentanz 12"", which lumbers like an elephant through a field of icicles. Then, with August 2000’s Oasis, he delivered his magnum opus. For many years, I’d considered Intershop to be his masterpiece, but with time, Oasis has come to rival its predecessor. The general approach is much the same as the first time out: The tempos are slow, the sounds dusty, the spaces between them yawning and empty. You can practically see the tumbleweeds bouncing through the music. But Oasis benefits from a more varied palette than Dettinger’s debut, and its crumbling sense of structure feels even stranger. The first track is made of little more than two chords that cycle each other warily, blasted and bit-crushed. It’s the kind of perfect loop that you could listen to for days, trying to decipher where it repeats and where it varies; after years of listening, I’m still not sure. The second track, on the other hand, is rendered in ultra-high fidelity, offsetting seismic dub bass with crystalline digital clicks. On track three he busts out shimmery guitars that sound much like the Cocteau Twins samples of Blond; track four’s toe-scuffing ambient techno sounds like it’s been cobbled together out of dust bunnies, sawdust, mica, and chalk. If Oasis doesn’t have anything that hits with the heartbreaking intensity of Intershop’s closing track, it’s more cohesive as an album. By turns sullen and ecstatic, it’s held together by its meditative air; every track feels like an experiment to see just how much can be removed. The closing track is the opposite of Intershop’s devastating finale: a trance-gated expression of pure, wordless bliss. Dettinger never released anything else under his surname; as far as I know, he never released anything else period. (According to Mayer, he worked in recording studios for a time, and eventually moved into the gaming industry.) But as far as posterity is concerned, he hardly needed to. Together, Intershop and Oasis invented a new vocabulary for ambient techno, creating the model for artists like the Field—Oasis’ closing track might as well be the starter from which the Field created his whole aesthetic—as well as Kompakt’s long-running Pop Ambient series. Dettinger’s influence stretches beyond the Kompakt label. You can hear it in the gravelly desolation of Actress’ grayscale fugues, the hobbling machine rhythms of Germany’s Workshop, the vinyl-hiss fantasia of Burial. Dettinger is the third inspiration cited in the liner notes to Panda Bear’s Person Pitch. “For us, he was the dude,” Noah Lennox once said of the German composer. Yet as influential as Dettinger’s albums have proven, few artists have struck quite the same balance of tumbledown rhythm, sandblasted texture, and bleeding-heart emotion. More than a quarter century later, his slim catalog feels increasingly unique: a fleeting collision of a moment, a creative vision, and a nascent scene, yielding a sound not to be repeated.

Masayoshi Fujita,Migratory,7.7,Experimental,"Birds possess a geographic intuition to make any cartographer weep. Year after year, migratory species travel thousands of miles, returning to the same nests with near-centimeter precision. Scientists believe our feathered friends are blessed with a specialized magnetoreceptor capable of reading Earth’s electromagnetic fields like a compass—fields so weak they couldn’t stick a magnet to your fridge. Masayoshi Fujita’s vibraphone is an equally uncanny organ, subtle and precise. Across Migratory his metallophone swells and swoops as if it too would like to ride the squalls and siroccos. Alternating between percussive spirals and languorous sound baths, Migratory refuses to flatten into ambient wallpaper, directing your ear to landmarks hundreds of miles underwing. “Desonata” twinkles and undulates like a softly expanding galaxy; “Pale Purple” plinks syncopated countermelodies against a wall of bowed dirges. These songs are deliberate but not meditative, more interested in depiction than reflection. Fujita guides listeners through lush and sparse terrain, equally likely to illustrate a placid lake or a sun-soaked field as a jagged mountain or arid badlands. Sometimes these landscapes can be shrouded, indistinct: “Distant Planet” traces a spare melody but feels almost too empty. At the other extreme, Moor Mother’s spoken-word performance on “Our Mother’s Lights” gilds the lily, stuffing one idea too many into the album’s most dynamic track; the texture of her ad-libs doesn’t quite make up for an anticlimactic stretch of free-associative writing. Despite the minor misfires, Migratory carves out its own contemplative niche, widening the scope of Fujita’s work through careful layering. Take “Higurashi,” featuring Hokkaido-via-London vocalist and composer Hatis Noit, which opens with a field recording of the titular cicadas. So closely does Noit’s tender vocal seem to mimic the rich tones of the vibraphone that, for the first two minutes, you nearly forget that Fujita hasn’t hit a note. When he finally enters, quiet as rustling leaves, it feels like a gentle exhale. Closer to earth, Mattias Hållsten teases out free reed disharmonies with the shō on three tracks including “Yodaka,” and Fujita’s father contributes saxophone. Fujita senior’s evocative brass undergirds Fujita junior’s headier ideas, stabilizing the fluttery “Blue Rock Thrush” and tethering “In a Sunny Meadow” via mournful topline. The collaborations widen Fujita’s palette, adding contrast and depth of field to his vibraphonic vistas. On one level, Migratory is a snapshot of Masayoshi Fujita’s own repatriation: After 13 years living in Berlin, the artist returned to his native Japan in 2020, living and recording amid the coastal hills of Kami-cho, Hyōgo. But on another, the album taps into an animal zugunruhe, that innate feeling telling us to spread our wings and go. Migratory balances this restlessness with an equanimous serenity unruffled by the gales, confident that Fujita’s scrupulous hand will catch the next updraft.

The Voidz,Like All Before You,5.5,Rock,"Julian Casablancas is searching. Since his last album with the Voidz, 2018’s Virtue, the Strokes frontman has been occupied with the deepest questions of our time: the limits of political philosophy, the ethics of artificial intelligence, and what school his two young sons should attend. In late 2020, the singer partnered with Rolling Stone for an interview series called S.O.S. — Earth Is a Mess, where he quizzed journalists, philosophers, and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang about democracy and freedom. Despite his attempts to earnestly engage his subjects on comparative economics and the psychology of Trump voters, the surrounding scenery and visual effects—public intellectual Noam Chomsky beamed in as a floating head rendered in a low-resolution color map, for example, with Casablancas washed in fuchsia and forest green—make the series nearly impossible to take seriously. On Like All Before You, his third album with the Voidz, Casablancas depicts his quest for a guru through the mediated sounds of chintzy synthesizers and vocoder vocals—the problem is, it seems even he can’t decide if he’s joking. The music of the Voidz exists on a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic dance floor. On Virtue, this came in the form of what Casablancas called “prison jazz,” which mostly translated to a persecution complex shouted over clipped guitar riffs and obnoxiously syncopated synths. On Like All Before You, Casablancas has moved past martyrdom (though not past self-aggrandizement, waxing nostalgic about his “lounge lizard” days on the Metallica-cover-band-esque “Prophecy of the Dragon”) and onto more metaphysical matters. He wants to find a leader to reveal to him some universal truth, though he can’t really decide who or what that is. On “Squarewave,” he looks to the transcendental meditation founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; on “Prophecy,” the Buddhist text Lotus Sutra might provide the skeleton key; by “Spectral Analysis,” he’s wooed by the doomed Heaven’s Gate cult. The brief references to and even quicker retreats from these heady concepts wear thin by halfway through the album’s tracklist, and that’s before he starts speaking in Latin on “When Will the Time of These Bastards End.” It’s hard to know how serious Casablancas’ political musings are—his lyrics about First Amendment rights and stolen votes—when those remarks follow a line like “I’m gonna blast her with my Stratocaster.” There are moments where his sheepish humor shines, like when he’s imagining the rush of recognizing a friend in a firing squad on “Flexorcist.” But taken as a whole, it sounds like spiritual whiplash. You’d be forgiven, though, for missing most of Casablancas’ quest for deeper meaning. Across the album, his voice is helplessly buried beneath vocal processing and mixed conspicuously low, as if to purposely obscure his lyrics. These effects aren’t new to the Voidz, but on Like All Before You, they dominate, obscuring any humanity in Casablancas’ vocals. Charitably, one could interpret this as a manifestation of Casablancas’ vision of a post-human society—one in which, as he sings on “All The Same,” “Every war is digital.” But these effects make the album a difficult listen, deflating the natural depth and world-weary crackle that made Casablancas’ voice so evocative on the Strokes’ most pared-back songs. At times, his retreat as a vocalist allows the rest of the Voidz to step into the spotlight, building out a pleasant post-punk groove on “All The Same” or digging into an interstellar disco freakout on “Flexorcist.” But those bright spots start to feel like consolations for sitting through a slog of unfettered stream-of-consciousness. It’s as if no one in the recording studio had the heart to tell Casablancas that his reference to Invictus in the sixth verse of “When Will the Time of These Bastards End” might be best left on the cutting room floor. On the relatively restrained “Perseverance-1C2S,” Casablancas hints at an alternative title for the Voidz’s third record. At the end of the first verse, he namechecks the band’s first two records—2014’s Tyranny and then Virtue—before listing a third noun: “Perseverance.” It’s an apt title for a band that seems to continue in the face of diminishing returns, ten years after a debut album that felt, at the time, like a one-off side project. But on Like All Before You, the gulf between the talent and versatility of the Voidz’s backing musicians and Casablancas’ increasingly harebrained theories is impossible to ignore. At least he didn’t try out the theses he spins in his lyrics on poor Noam Chomsky first. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Still House Plants,"If I don​’​t make it, I love u",8.5,Rock,"Whatever ineffable force makes music feel both contained and alive, Still House Plants have it. Their beautifully fractured sound seems made of nerve endings, like the band’s process is on view and we’re hearing the very moment of a Still House Plants song taking shape. The London trio of vocalist Jess Hickie-Kallenbach, guitarist Finlay Clark, and drummer David Kennedy, who met about a decade ago at the Glasgow School of Art, once said they practice only the starts and endings of their songs, which underscores how each one works: as a vessel for abandon. Is it telepathy that guides them? When Still House Plants made their U.S. debut in New York last spring, they often communicated among themselves with just their eyes. Elongated silences held between notes would put the audience on edge before everything crashed together at exquisitely incongruous angles. On stage as on record, the trio inhabits the free space of punk and the capaciousness of free improvisation at their own frequency. Like 2020’s Fast Edit, which established Still House Plants as one of the most exciting experimental rock bands around, If I don’t make it, I love u still eschews conventional song forms in favor of a kind of collective flickering, with rhythms that speed and slow by their own logic and carry the persistent charge of small epiphanies. But this is a bolder, clearer, preternaturally vivid iteration of their music; “I’ve been trying to get much stronger,” Hickie-Kallenbach sings on “MORE BOY,” a thesis. Kennedy brings the inquisitiveness of a free-jazz drummer while Clark uses their guitar to synthesize the glimmer of Midwest emo and ’90s slowcore with the choppy minimalism of no wave. Hickie-Kallenbach’s deep, soulful singing suggests Tirzah’s R&B rasp if it were more elastic and ecstatic. The band applies the tropes of electronic music (samples, breaks, loops) in the way they construct, or more accurately deconstruct, songs with only guitar, voice, and drums. A Still House Plants song is a three-way search forward. It’s always a high-wire act. The album is divided into 11 tracks, but it feels anchored more discernibly by specific moments within songs: notes and tones that make you think, What’s that? The answer might be some unknown glitter in the guitar, or some marvelous friction, like the sparks that punctuate “M M M” or the buzzsaw discord that cuts through “Silver grit passes thru my teeth” like a flash of shoegaze. The melted chords of “Pant” and wobbly edges of “3scr3w3” make me think fleetingly of Autechre (and it’s hard to imagine another band that could simultaneously conjure Autechre and American Football while speaking their own language entirely). On “MORE BOY,” when the drums pick up midway and Hickie-Kallenbach’s singing locks in, ascending over Clark’s chiming guitar, it’s chilling. The singer’s guttural vocals glitch, digging into a repeated phrase, as if she were sampling herself using only her voice. “MORE BOY” also proves Kennedy’s assertion in an interview with The Wire that withholding drum fills “helps in building up a continuous phrase that never finishes,” a liminal sound. Still House Plants play with an egalitarian ethos; no one instrument dictates how a song moves. “It’s natural to think that the voice sits at the front, the drums drive, and the guitar is like the bricks, but we move all that around quite a lot,” Hickie-Kallenbach recently told The Quietus. Clark said that “it’s important to remember [the guitar] is just metal and wood,” and “not to get too caught up in what a guitar is ‘supposed’ to do.” Perhaps this extends to the way Hickie-Kallenbach’s lyrics, which are often inscrutable, don’t seem to determine what a song is about—as she told The Wire, she distances herself from the mandate to “narrativize” as the vocalist. But when her words do ring clearly, If I don’t make it, I love u offers a unique mix of mystery and disclosure. “Deeply sensitive, deeply watchful, mostly head down,” Hickie-Kallenbach sings shyly on “no sleep deep risk,” putting a character inside the music’s abstractions; “I really like it my way.” On “M M M,” I’m pretty sure she croons, “I just want my friends to get me/I want most to support them,” between admissions that “I just want to be seen right” and “I wish I was called Makita,” the melisma of “called” lasting five full seconds. This heartfelt sentiment feels just as risky as the improvisatory bones of the music. It emphasizes the intimacy and vulnerability inherent in their cracked-open musical dialogue. The very title of the album is an emotional prism: If I don’t make it, I love u could be what you’d say to a friend when you’re not sure if you’ll make their birthday party, or it could be the most tragic text message ever composed. There are precedents for Still House Plants’ postmodern collage and fragmentation. This is the process-oriented essence of ’70s post-punk, prioritizing deconstructed sounds over impossible wholeness—a fractured aesthetic for our fractured, plural selves. Still House Plants have cited other ’90s and early-’00s math-rock and slowcore influences (like Bedhead, Life Without Buildings, and Red House Painters, who inspired their band name). Yet to fixate on the past feels at odds with the unfixed music. If Still House Plants truly evoke anything about those predecessors, it’s how firmly their vision feels of its time—not only in the fevered assembly and unraveling of their stylistic melange, but in the fusion of emotional candor, electronic technique, and conceptual art strategies. It speaks further to Still House Plants’ rare power that this record comes out via a tiny UK label called Bison, which was created after its founder, an employee of London avant-garde music hub Cafe Oto, saw a 2016 set by the band and established the imprint to release their debut.

Jaeychino,WATCH THE THRONE,7.0,Rap,"According to Washington, DC’s Jaeychino, DMV street rap underwent a subtle vibe shift in 2022. Much of the scene’s output has retained a recognizably rambling, syncopated flow and kick-heavy production style over the past half-decade. But in the last two years, its rising stars have distanced themselves from the drill-adjacent “free car music,” embracing moody soundscapes and reflective lyricism. “That free car shit was just draining,” the 19-year-old told an interviewer earlier this year. His recent run of mixtapes—alongside efforts by regional peers like Nino Paid and KP Skywalka—provides a cathartic alternative, treating 16s like trauma release exercises. While there’s plenty of reminiscing on WATCH THE THRONE, Jaeychino’s latest release, his songcraft is also grounded in the present, juxtaposing painful recollections against a mundane stream of scenes from his everyday life. He makes time fold in on itself, scattering fragments of memory across stuttering, distorted production. As usual, Jaeychino primarily collaborates with local talent, sourcing most of his beats from DC’s SJR and ian affiliate sxprano. Their collective influences are more diverse than ever. The instrumentals on “GOD INTERLUDE” and “WOODY” harken back to Icedancer-era Bladee, buffeting elegant cloud rap samples with glitchy, kaleidoscopic filters. On the former song, squeaky synth leads short-circuit as Jaeychino reflects on his tumultuous teenage years and the hope his recent success brings; there’s a sense of detachment in his delivery, as if he’s still not quite processed it all. He’s torn up over finding out that his own father stole from him, but the trauma is divulged as a quick aside, sandwiched between memories of scamming food delivery apps in high school and checking the view counts on song uploads. Where do you even start when there’s so much to confess and it’s all still so raw? Jaeychino’s lyrics usually lean depressing, but WATCH THE THRONE’s moments of levity are its most compelling tracks. On “Iloveindy 2,” one of his many odes to his girlfriend, he’s riding high on a psychedelic beat by NYC-based duo Evilgiane and Braindeadd, driving aimlessly through their city when he’s struck by sudden feelings of love. The translucent clouds of sub bass and triumphant, brassy melodies would feel right at home in a Nintendo DS-era Pokémon soundtrack. “Bridgerton Sex Scene,” a track about hooking up while the titular Netflix show plays in the background, is so oddly specific you’d think Jaeychino hopped in the booth and recapped his entire morning. It’s like he’s the DMV’s Frank O’Hara, dashing off a lunch poem in his free time. With their emphasis on flickering, bitcrushed textures, most of the beats add a cybernetic touch to Jaeychino’s diaristic raps. But the pair of straight-ahead sample drill songs, which loop source material by the Cranberries and Imogen Heap, are disappointingly safe outliers. Did the underground really need another “Just For Now” flip? His experiments in fusing street rap subgenres with influences from esoteric corners of SoundCloud are much more compelling, like the clubby flirtations with digicore and IDM on “Armed & Dangerous.” As he fits together pieces of a stressful adolescence, he’s forging a new, more experimental path within the DC area’s angsty post-free car sound. Jaeychino is still coming into his own, but the DMV underground’s throne is squarely in his view.",0,"August 29, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jaeychino-watch-the-throne/
Various Artists,Soundbombing II,8.6,,"From the moment Puff said it, it felt wrong. When the disgraced Bad Boy Entertainment founder rapped, on The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Mo Money Mo Problems,” that “ten years from now, we’ll still be on top,” it was in that flat preening monotone. Hip-hop’s commercial trajectory appeared to be such that he and his peers might keep accumulating yachts, but the dynasty he envisioned never seemed credible. By the time that song was finally released as a single, on July 15, 1997, Big had been dead for more than four months, and Puff’s Police-sampling elegy, “I’ll Be Missing You,” was already a No. 1 hit. In the video for “Mo Money,” when Puff raps the “ten years” line, he’s standing next to Mase in one of those glittering wind tunnels; they flit between different outfits and setups, their shimmying intercut with a team of dancers given slightly more robust choreography. Eventually we see archival footage of Big, presented with all the care and solemnity of the Terminator 2 clips that play as you wait in line at Universal Studios. Big’s assassination left a vacuum in New York hip-hop. Jay-Z and DMX would move to fill it, each succeeding in different ways; even with the Wu-Tang momentum waning, Ghostface was regrouping to prepare for Supreme Clientele; Big Pun was getting acrobatic; underneath all of this, Zev Love X had reemerged, rapping with stockings over his face at the Nuyorican Poets Café as MF DOOM. At every strata, in little venues with sticky floors and yawning boardrooms alike, artists seemed to be competing not only for commercial supremacy, but for the right to drag the genre, and the city, in the creative direction they saw fit. One week after “Mo Money Mo Problems” was issued to radio, Company Flow’s Funcrusher Plus became the first release from an independent label called Rawkus Records. The trio, comprised of rapper-producers El-P and Bigg Jus and DJ Mr. Len, had sold more than 30,000 copies of their 1995 vinyl-only EP Funcrusher without any label support; when Rawkus founders Jarret Myer and Brian Brater approached them with the financial backing of their friend James Murdoch—he of those Murdochs, the Murdoch Murdochs—they felt they’d have the creative latitude they needed to expand Funcrusher into something even more bludgeoning and unsettling. The expanded album opens with a too-sly extended joke about child molestation, then a quip about 2Pac being shot at Quad Studios in 1994 (this being less than a year after Pac was eventually killed in Las Vegas). Funcrusher Plus is often brooding and brutal, El-P’s production ingenious and totalizing. While the majority of its verses are de rigueur battle raps, the album sounds like one particularly grim vision of the future. Over the course of 1997, Company Flow became a minor sensation, its singles fixtures on late-night radio, its cassette passed furtively around college campuses. It signaled something serious and subterranean—something El-P would go on to articulate even more fully, and more apocalyptically through his own indie imprint, Definitive Jux—but it was too knotty, caustic, and unconcerned with biographical mythmaking to mount a serious challenge to the then shiny-suit status quo. For that, Myer, Brater, and Murdoch would turn to someone far more assured of his own place in a hip-hop lineage. Before he signed to Rawkus, Mos Def had appeared on Stakes Is High, the 1996 De La Soul album that became a sort of talisman of classicist revivalism. Through his own solo debut, 1997’s “Universal Magnetic,” and his other appearances on Soundbombing, Rawkus’ compilation mixtape from the same year, he immediately established himself as the can’t-miss talent from his generation: technically virtuosic but defiantly syncretic, weaving threads of hip-hop culture from the early ’80s into something bold and poetic and rhythmically inventive. (As with Big, there is literally no evidence of Mos, now Yasiin Bey, being less than a masterful musician: from the earliest demos, the syllables fall just so.) So when, in 1998, Rawkus issued his joint album with another Brooklyn MC, Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star, it was an actual gauntlet thrown. Black Star was released on the same day, in September of that year, as Jay’s Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life and A Tribe Called Quest’s The Love Movement (and, down in Atlanta, OutKast’s Aquemini). “Definition” and “Respiration” were not going to vie with “Money Cash Hoes” and “Can I Get A…” for airtime on Hot 97, but Rawkus’ new distribution deal with industry giant Priority—combined with the underground rallying around Mos as its next great hope—made it sincerely impactful. It was also cast, for reasons both in and out of its control, as a direct, even militant counterpoint to the Jays and Puffs of the world. In a 2011 interview with Pitchfork, Questlove remembers an edition of the vaunted Lyricist Lounge performance series from 1997, in which Mos rapped his version of Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” which would eventually appear on Black Star. Where Rick’s original was a pulp-crime classic, Mos turned the song into a parable: The transparent Puff stand-in, bastardizing the artform for profit, ends up riddled with bullets. Questlove recalls whooping, hollering, high-fiving the friends he was with; he also recalls Puff, “14 deep with dudes dressed in all-black,” glowering at him from the periphery. So when Rawkus was preparing to release Soundbombing II in May 1999, a little over two years after Big’s death, there were clear battle lines, even though fatigue had set in on both sides of the culture war. The Bad Boy heyday had given way to something slightly more rugged, but there was no serious thought that Mos and company were going to supplant Jay-Z; some rappers on the more commercial side were even frustrated they had been cordoned off from the underground rappers they thought of as friends and peers. (Less than a half-decade later, Jay himself would rap wistfully about the alternate path where he became Talib Kweli.) Though showily brilliant in many places, Soundbombing II is not a campaign platform; it doesn’t prescribe a roadmap for the future of hip-hop. It feels, to mix metaphors the way its contributors do so deftly, more like a life raft, the last scrap of context in which their particular skill sets make sense. As the millennium drew to a close, so too did a whole school of hip-hop, its most eager practitioners lining up to freeze themselves in time. Oddly enough for a record (and label) so self-consciously New York, the genesis of Soundbombing II was in Los Angeles. It was there that J Rocc and DJ Babu of the legendary Orange County-founded DJ crew the Beat Junkies were working at a Fat Beats location frequented by Mos and Kweli. Soon they asked the pair to take over for DJ Evil Dee of Da Beatminerz, who had helmed the original Soundbombing. In the past quarter-century, the popular understanding of the album/mixtape distinction has evolved and then disappeared. What were first DJ-driven ventures and showcases for emerging artists became opportunities for major rappers to circumvent their labels; today it is a nominal divide at best, the mixtape designation used to lower expectations and artificially lengthen contractual obligations. But Babu and J Rocc took their assignment literally, adding scratches throughout, blending songs into one another, and filling out the tape with intros that make it feel like one ever-evolving track. Even if Babu and J Rocc weren’t the ones to broker the relationships, their deployment of spoken interludes from Prince Paul and Q-Tip is expert, signaling not just a spiritual but a literal line back to the Native Tongues movement, New York’s last great aesthetic and philosophical counterpoint to mainstream rap. Yet it’s crucial to note that with Soundbombing II, Rawkus did not try to recreate 3 Feet High and Rising. There is without question a true-school, show-and-prove ethos that can be easily traced back to recorded rap’s beginnings, but little here scans as nostalgia or revivalism. Nor did Rawkus ask El-P to furnish this cast of MCs with beats that sounded like an extension of Funcrusher Plus’s dystopia. Even if you project onto the battle raps a specific enemy—Jay, Puff, Lyor Cohen—the broader point seems to be one of refinement, of craft, of practice. These are superbly competent craftsmen over beats that could have been made any time between 36 Chambers and Get Rich or Die Tryin’; they burrow deeper and deeper into grooves that would soon be abandoned, filled in, paved over by genre and industry that was changing rapidly. If there’s something quixotic about that, no one told R.A. the Rugged Man. While Soundbombing II is a true compilation—a handful of songs are pulled from prior, smaller releases, or would appear on subsequent LPs—Mos Def’s verses provide something of a spine. On the Posdnous-produced “Crosstown Beef,” Mos teams with his younger brother, DCQ, to weave a story about a shooting outside a nightclub that’s full of uncommon texture: the expansiveness of an emptyish parking garage, the hue of the tints on a menacing car’s windows. On that song, even after shots ring out, Mos is poised, as if all of this is preordained. But when he opens the High & Mighty’s “B-Boy Document ‘99,” he whips himself into a frenzy—to the point where, by his verse’s end, he’s offering something of a mission statement for Rawkus, and for the movement it hoped to represent: Don’t know what your label telling youOr what magic beans they selling youI can flow, you can’t though, exampleOf a cat who just a modern-day SamboWho be bitching out to A&R demands soYou can collect your little petty cash advance, hoYou knock-kneed and sloppy, but not meI'm I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T Soundbombing II is not always so righteous. There are points at which the album teeters on the brink of self-parody. Pharoahe Monch opens “WWIII” by rapping “Cleverly beginnin’ ‘em with synonyms when I went in with homonyms”; El-P’s Howard Zinn-ass verse on “Patriotism” (“Indelible NATO force hidden agenda, puppet governments/I’m lovin’ it!”) is the kind of thing that gets passed around high schools like a sort of dial-up Rosetta Stone. But in both these instances, and others throughout the record, the rappers retain the charm that comes from expertise and enthusiasm. The warnings about hormone-injected dairy products are delivered with just enough acid to feel dangerous. Silly as that single bar stripped from context reads, Monch emerges on Soundbombing II as a major force. After ending his three-album run as half of Organized Konfusion (the apex of which was the 1994 masterpiece Stress: The Extinction Agenda), Monch signed with Rawkus and got to work on his razor-toothed solo debut, Internal Affairs, which would be released later in ’99. While he ends up acquitting himself well on “WWIII,” Monch steals the entire LP with “Mayor,” his breathless yarn from the perspective of a cop who gets close to the mayor just to assassinate him. “Mayor” was produced by Lee Stone and is built around the same Lamont Dozier sample that RZA would flip for Ghostface’s “Saturday Nite” the following year. While there is not a consistent palette from which all the producers on Soundbombing II draw, the standout beats are unforgettable: Capital the Crime Lord’s punishing slink for “Stanley Kubrick,” DJ Spinna’s glitchy fugue on “7XL.” On “When It Pours It Rains,” Diamond D turns one of the downbeat parts of the Rocky score into a wonderfully, typically understated bounce. The cameo from Prince Paul, who was already a legendary producer before helming De La Soul’s first three albums, signaled a connection to the Native Tongues—the movement that strove, in the early ‘90s, to make New York rap jazzier, more colorful, and more Afrocentric. In a similar way, Kid Capri’s appearance on the intro to “Crosstown Beef” positions the Rawkus crew as natural successors to a more monocultural post in New York rap—that which would be inescapable on radio mix shows, on Canal St., out of aftermarket car stereos. And while the record represents (or was made to represent) a specific point of view on hip-hop as a culture and industry in 1999, it articulates that view through such a variety of vocal styles that it begins to feel nearly comprehensive of what was happening in New York at the moment. To hear this, one needs only to contrast the silkiness of “When It Pours” with “Brooklyn Hard Rock,” where Thirstin Howl III raps as if every line ends with an exclamation point. Babu and J Rocc give Soundbombing II a natural shape, sequencing concentric arcs of pacing and rhythm that underscore longer, thematic ones. The gritted teeth of the opening third slowly slacken to allow for more eccentric iterations of the same styles. One of the album’s few detectable commercial concessions comes right at the top. Eminem’s “Any Man,” which had been previously circulated as part of a demo and then had its verses meted out as radio freestyles, all designed to showcase his corrupted-cartoon imagery and elastic rhyming style. The song could have easily slotted onto The Slim Shady LP, which was released in February ‘99 and put Em immediately on the conveyor belt to superstardom. A year later, on The Marshall Mathers LP’s “Stan,” a mark of the titular fan’s obsession is his knowing “the shit you did with Rawkus.” Professed rap nerd though he is, once Eminem crossed the threshold onto TRL and interest-group pamphlets, he couldn’t go back; the barrier was not a permeable one. Here you could say something trite like “Time marches on,” but that’s sort of the opposite of what Soundbombing II argues. Back in 1993, near the end of Tribe’s Midnight Marauders, Q-Tip relays some advice: “My man Extra P said, ‘Don’t say the years.’” That note, from the producer Large Professor, was about posterity—hip-hop was supposed to be “eternal,” not tethered to the moment. Soundbombing II’s lead single shirks this idea. “1-9-9-9,” which pairs Common with Brand Nubian’s Sadat X, settles into a midtempo, but something roils underneath. “Holding liquor in despair,” Com raps: Gang signs in the airI shine in spaces where time is just a glareHold the mic like a memory. The scratched hook—punctuated by Chuck D’s booming, disembodied voice—is simply the year, one digit at a time, explicated and inescapable. A little over a half-decade later, toward the final moments of Late Registration, Kanye West interpolates that song, which was no doubt burned into his brain as a fan-turned-collaborator of Common. He’s recounting his past, and that year—the one… nine… nine… nine…—is made to sound like ancient history. Because of course it is. In the early 2000s, Mos had rejected whatever savior status had been thrust upon him; Kweli and Com had seen their careers revived by Kanye himself; Jay had retired; the balance of power in rap had shifted down to Atlanta; the CD sales that made a venture like Soundbombing worth it to Priority were about to crater. Underground rap had splintered. It was no longer a unified counterpoint to a similarly monolithic mainstream. Instead, it deviated in specific ways—hyperpolitical like Immortal Technique, hyperpersonal like Slug, dipping into the avant-garde like Busdriver. Later in 1999, Rawkus would release not only a set of Company Flow instrumentals, but High & Mighty’s Home Field Advantage and then, separated by only one week in October, Internal Affairs and Mos Def’s Black on Both Sides. There could be no ambiguity: This was the most important independent label in hip-hop. By the time Soundbombing III was released three years later, the run had all but ended. But in a genre built on the ephemeral—did you hear what so-and-so said over a James Brown break last night?—a fleeting moment being captured so completely defies any reasonable expectation.",0,"August 25, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-soundbombing-ii/
Daddy Yankee,Barrio Fino,9.3,Rap,"Maybe you were at a basement party, grinding with a pimply crush in low-rise flare jeans and a belly button ring you couldn’t stop staring at. Maybe, if you were a little older, you were driving around your city with too many friends in the backseat. Maybe, if you were in the Caribbean, you were at a party de marquesina learning what your hips and ass could do. Maybe you heard it at a middle school dance and felt compelled to engage in the ritual of a preteen dancefloor tryst. Maybe you bought it as a ringtone for your brand new hot pink Motorola RAZR flip phone. Maybe you were in East Harlem, or Humboldt Park, or Santurce, or a suburban strip mall town in middle America. No matter where you lived, there’s a strong chance that at some point between 2004 and 2005, you heard Daddy Yankee announce his arrival in the U.S. mainstream with a crystal-clear introduction: “Who’s this? Da-ddy Yank-ee!”  “Gasolina” was ubiquitous back then: That shouted hook, revving engine, and indelible, blistering pre-chorus blasted from every boombox, every passing car window, and every iPod Mini. “Gasolina” was the dawn of an empire. Barrio Fino, the album it appeared on, was the first reggaeton LP to debut at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Latin Albums chart, spending 24 weeks in the top spot. In 2005, it won a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Music Album. Within a year of the record’s release, Daddy Yankee had landed a $20 million record deal with Interscope, a sneaker collab with Reebok, a Pepsi sponsorship, and a controversial modeling gig with Sean Jean. If reggaeton was going to go global, Yankee was going to squeeze every cent he could out of it. After all, the man got an associate’s degree in accounting so he wouldn’t be cheated “out of money.” This is the enduring image of Daddy Yankee: genre pioneer, business tycoon, reggaeton king. On Barrio Fino, Yankee presents himself as the commander of a movement that was poised to assume market dominance. But beyond its commercial impact, which is just one benchmark of its influence, Barrio Fino is also a document of a genre in a moment of transformation. This is an album that carries the knotty histories of reggaeton within it—from its origins as a form of protest poetry, to its transition into a moneymaking global force, to its role in affirming the imagined identity of Latinidad. Daddy Yankee, born Ramón Ayala, said he imagined Barrio Fino in part as an antidote to reductive portrayals of life in the projects. “The news you see everywhere is always marginalizing [the barrio], or blaming it for things that aren’t its fault,” he said in a 2005 interview. The barrio in question was Villa Kennedy, the caserío, or public housing project, where Yankee cut his teeth freestyling at 13 years old. At 16, he started recording his own mixtapes, hawking bootleg cassettes for $5. In the early ’90s, reggaeton hadn’t quite consolidated into the genre we know it as today; one of its precursors was known as underground, and Yankee was one of its preeminent practitioners. The Puerto Rican government used the music as a scapegoat for the proliferation of gangs, petty crime, and drug addiction. Then-Governor Pedro Rosselló implemented an anti-crime campaign that also targeted underground artists, leading to police raids of record stores that sold their cassettes in February 1995. By the time Barrio Fino rolled around, Daddy Yankee was a star in Puerto Rico. He’d appeared on DJ Playero’s foundational underground mixtapes in the ’90s and had local hits with solo albums and compilations, like 2002’s El Cangri.com, 2003’s Los Homerun-es, and Luny Tunes’ Más Flow anthology the same year. He knew the sweet spot between bombast and pillow talk, and he knew how to speak about reggaeton’s favorite topic and to its primary audience: women. Above all, he was the kind of rapper who could ensnare you with an irresistible hook, only to stun you with a technically dazzling verse moments later. But not everyone was a fan of Daddy Yankee—or reggaeton at all, for that matter. Most of the entertainment industry had blacklisted reggaeton, refusing to play it on the radio, in spite of its grassroots popularity. White middle- and upper-class communities in Puerto Rico and across Latin America scorned the genre, associating it with poverty, vulgarity, and Blackness. In interviews around the time the album was released, Yankee wasn’t afraid to point out the irony in the genre’s commercial success, given its previously denigrated status. “When we started, no one wanted to help us. There is racism, classism in Puerto Rico,” he told The New York Post in 2005. Later that year, he elaborated on the prejudice the genre faced in The Washington Post. “The government didn’t understand the subculture. To them, we were just criminals and dumb kids doing this music. We had to prove we were too smart for the system. And we did it.” El Cangri modeled his career after hip-hop moguls like Jay-Z or Sean Combs, building a kingdom with music at the center. But part of that enterprise was an identity movement, too—a thesis about a generation of young people who saw reggaeton as an affirmation of their heritage, one that would yield the questionable, feel-good promise of representation. “Reggaeton means the same thing to Latino youth as hip-hop does to African American kids,” Yankee told The Washington Post in 2005. “The young kids now, they’re looking at Daddy Yankee and Tego‬ Calderón and Ivy Queen like kids in the American hood look up to 50 Cent or 2Pac.” In his vexed invocation of hip-hop, Yankee creates an ideological distance between Latinidad and Blackness—as if the two are mutually exclusive, or as if young Latines couldn’t also feel kinship with it. In addition to the muddled racial politics, Yankee’s comments back then speak volumes about the marketing, public reception, and stylistic choices of Barrio Fino. Artistically, Barrio Fino is the ultimate exposition of Daddy Yankee’s gifts. The album slots party tracks right next to political statements; bleeding-heart breakup anthems next to brutal tongue-lashings against his enemies. The first quarter of the album is a perreo fight club. On “King Daddy,” an early avowal of his supremacy in the genre, he snarls a threat to a hater in double-time: “Tomorrow you’ll be food for the birds on the asphalt,” he spits, glass shattering in the background. Producer duo Luny Tunes arrange sputtering snare rolls into machine gun blasts. RIP to their victims. “Dale Caliente” is a reggaeton shoot-out complete with samples of cocking handguns and sprayed bullets. Daddy Yankee issues a warning to anyone who thinks they’re tough enough to square up, then lusts after a woman who’s igniting the dancefloor with her trembling ass cheeks. Glory and Blacka Nice, an unsung reggaeton diva and a dancehall vocalist, pepper the track with some breathless ad-libs. Neither are credited on the song, a fact that reflects one of reggaeton’s more iniquitous traditions: the excision of its Jamaican and femme contributors. Glory famously sang the “dame más gasolina” hook on the smash hit; she also has features on three other songs here, none of which are credited. In some moments, Daddy Yankee returns to his rap roots, sidestepping reggaeton altogether. “Santifica Tus Escapularios” is a merciless attack on his foes, recalling the freestyle battles he grew up on. He aims vicious barbs at an unidentified adversary (rumored to be fellow reggaeton trailblazer Don Omar at the time), even referring to his target as a shit-eating vagrant. “Salud y Vida” incorporates tubas from Mexican banda, evoking Chicano rap classics as Yankee casts doubt on a culture obsessed with material things, rather than human life. On the highlight “Corazones,” Yankee gets political. The song tackles the “spirit of death” that devours Puerto Rico’s caseríos, calling for a truce between gangs and decrying the government for not putting enough resources into education. In spite of his lyrical dexterity, some of these beats rely on predictable conventions of “conscious” hip-hop—theatrical minor-key pianos, church-choir flourishes (it’s like El Cangri strapped on a backpack and fastened it as tightly as he could). But the messages they carry are potent, and only slightly diluted by those choices. Daddy Yankee—the world-weary critic, the caserío documentarian—was always capable of making more than club anthems, even if the radio was hyper-fixated on the party-hard ethos of “Gasolina.” And while most listeners outside of the Caribbean thought that reggaeton could only be about stunting or bumping uglies, El Cangri demonstrated the genre’s romantic textures, too. “Like You” is a suave R&B-reggaeton serenade delivered in Spanglish, a rare crossover maneuver that invokes Big Pun’s “Still Not a Player.” This is a far cry from the unflinching raunch of earlier reggaeton mixtapes, like DJ Blass’ Reggaeton Sex series, and evidence of the way artists and producers were softening the genre’s roots for radio appeal. The classic “No Me Dejes Solo” features Wisin y Yandel, whose vocal registers make them ideal yelling partners; all three reggaeton vanguards beg a woman to save them from loneliness with their signature barked raps. “Tu Príncipe,” with Zion y Lennox, is a perfect slice of narrative-driven reggaeton, telling the story of a man who longs to be more than just a woman’s friend. Although he was far from the only one moving the genre in this direction, Daddy Yankee was making strategic, market-oriented artistic choices that happened to feel authentic, too. Stories of breakups and relationship woes may seem like pretty run-of-the-mill thematic fare for reggaeton in 2024, but just two years before Barrio Fino’s release, a Puerto Rican senator launched a campaign against reggaeton’s “dirty lyrics” and lewd content, calling it a trigger “for criminal acts” (Tellingly, the same politician appeared onstage during a stadium show with reggaeton icons Héctor and Tito el Bambino a year later). Romantic tracks were a way to “clean up” reggaeton for the radio, but they also felt like a natural artistic evolution as reggaeton’s popularity surged. It’s basically impossible for a reggaeton artist not to scream “Latino!” in one of their songs at this point, but back then, the explicit overtures to a shared ethnic identity were newer. On “Like You,” Daddy Yankee appeals to the community twice, summoning all his “Latinos to stand up” and declaring himself “proud to be Latin.” On “El Muro,” he refers to reggaeton as the sound that makes “everyone in Latin America move,” closing out the song with a call for all Latinos to keep perreando. The classic “Lo Que Pasó, Pasó” lifts piano keys and a horn section from Dominican merengue, while “Sabor a Melao” taps salsa legend Andy Montañez as a guest vocalist. As the scholar Wayne Marshall has written, these choices—speaking to a Latine audience, invoking elements of culturally accepted genres like salsa and merengue—helped fuel the perception that reggaeton was the music of a wider community, one with a “recognizably Latin” sound. At the same time, these stylistic changes began to shift its perception as a stigmatized Black genre from the projects. Even if the Daddy Yankee of 2024 does not look anything like the Daddy Yankee of 20 years ago; even if the reggaeton lion largely abandoned social commentary in his work; even if, in the 2010s, he began to churn out mostly middle-of-the-road pop-perreo hits, including Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito,” perhaps the most diluted version of reggaeton possible—that is until Justin Bieber hopped on the remix and went viral after he flubbed the lyrics in a vaguely xenophobic drunken haze at New York celebrity hotspot 1 OAK; even if he announced his retirement in 2022, only to return to the public eye late last year as a born-again Christian: Barrio Fino is unquestionably an artistic triumph. It captures Yankee at his peak—as an agile lyricist, cultural envoy, and forever hitmaker. The album, along with other reggaeton titans of the era, forced the Latin music industry to re-examine its aesthetics, its business interests, and its biases. And of course, Barrio Fino is also an artistic proposition—a statement about poverty and sex and joy and hardship, and the ways reggaeton has soundtracked all of those realities. In its movements between the dancefloor, the bedroom, and the block, Barrio Fino illustrates the capaciousness—and complexity—of a genre forever defined by transformation.

Goat Girl ,Below the Waste,7.7,Rock,"Goat Girl are a balancing act, really. The London art rock trio tempered references to cyanide with wry melodies on their eponymous 2018 debut album, and they used cool synths to make having scabies sound more chill on 2021’s On All Fours. Their third album, Below the Waste, once more pilfers the garbage can for inspiration—entrails and mud are some featured lyrics—but they’re not as explicit as they used to be. Now, the band’s mastery of balance lies mostly in their production. Below the Waste welds Goat Girl’s scrap-metal clanging to the more subtle garage-pop groove of On All Fours, creating a more refined version of the band’s music. They’re jumping into filth, and doing it with style. To commemorate the occasion, the band seems to have dropped their Throbbing Gristle-type monikers. Singer Clottie Cream has turned back into Lottie Pendlebury, bassist Holly Hole has closed and formed Holly Mullineaux, and drummer Rosy Bones welcomes Rosy Jones. Shedding even this thin layer of artifice, with co-production help from black midi engineer John “Spud” Murphy, reflects the band’s fresh interest in analog sounds. Some of Below the Waste’s most exhilarating moments come from a textural mishmash of orchestral arrangements and the steely glam of synths. A plucked guitar continually cracks the TV static surface of “words fell out” like a faraway bird popping through the clouds, and it softens Pendlebury’s vocal delivery, which has some Tori Amos or red-wine dryness. “perhaps” thickens her voice with a drunken clarinet melody, deepening the phone anxiety she sings about. The flute that comes later is beautiful, but no match for a drooling guitar line’s growing darkness. All of these sounds fight for space in the songs and build an infectious tension throughout the record. Through these exciting layers, Goat Girl pad Below The Waste with luxurious fullness, occasionally to the album’s detriment. At 16 songs, Below the Waste returns Goat Girl to 2018, when their debut album floundered in its 19-song bloat. Two of Below the Waste’s instrumental interludes, “s.m.o.g.” and “prelude,” sound like lo-fi guitar tuning, and they don’t counter or contribute much to the album’s lithe energy. But, for the rest of its runtime, Below the Waste’s decadent production holds your attention. We hear Pendlebury sigh in infinity circles on “pretty faces,” as if she’s continuously collapsing on the song’s decadent mattress of strings, and it builds our suspense for the coming breakdown: a small windstorm of groaning, chorus pads, and stuttering violin. While most of Below the Waste’s songs value symmetry in their lush instrumentation and vocal harmonies, it’s thrilling when one overtakes the other. Most of the frantic and fed-up “tcnc” sounds completely swallowed by an earthquake, with synth buzzing through everything like a passing train. On the opposite end, a stabby, brassy keyboard hook guides us down the listless “motorway” like a row of buttons, but Pendlebury’s sleep-deprived vignettes—“Called out shotgun/Motion sickness/Road to nowhere”—make it careful and romantic. This ability to summon intensity without a lyrical shock factor is new for Goat Girl, and they’re better for it. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Nikki Nair,,7.7,Electronic,"ESG, Liquid Liquid, and LCD Soundsystem; cowbells, scratchy guitars, and hi-hats—we all know how dance punk goes. But what if there was another way? This is the question that Atlanta producer Nikki Nair poses on Snake, having recently turned his attention to rethinking 2-step on his 2023 EP with Hudson Mohawke, Set the Roof. Collaborations have been a major part of Nair’s work so far; over the past two years, he has worked with everyone from Sam Binga to DJ ADHD—a mark of his flexible charm. Nair’s productions and DJ sets are defined by their eclecticism, swinging from UK garage to trance via IDM and pure pop. His range is admirable, but it makes it hard to pin down exactly who Nikki Nair is. The Snake EP redresses those uncertainties. At six tracks long, it ties with 2020’s Just Reduction as Nair’s longest solo release. More importantly, it is his most personal work yet. His family adopted the snake as their guardian—he calls them “a symbol of my life-force”—and the record’s sound is a homage to the DIY and punk scenes in which he grew up. Rather than raiding the well-worn dance-punk sound that the Rapture once called home, Nair pays tribute by selectively combining dance and punk tropes. “Worm” joins a ferocious electro-punk beat to a dirt-eating synth motif that sounds like Mr. Oizo gone screamo or Suicide at their most unhinged. “Prowler” has a crudely bedraggled riff worthy of the gnarliest rock deadbeat and a bassline that shrieks like a dubstep dinosaur; and “Snake” is the Prodigy after they’ve blown both studio speakers and label recording budget. Listeners who found the latest Justice album lacking in drama will encounter plenty of roaring filth to satisfy their needs, as will fans of Daft Punk’s rusty, rasping Human After All. Nair has said that the six tracks on the Snake EP were an outlet for his anger and frustration, which might explain the record’s overblown sound and occasional breakbeat fury. But the songs also reflect confusion and joy, a salmagundi of emotions that helps the EP to breathe beyond the slightly one-dimensional punk smashers at its core. The opening “Sugar Kingdom” is a contemplative electro number, bass-sprung but sparse and stumbling, to which Nair adds a spookily understated vocal, more gentle lie-down than John Lydon. The result is as fragile as a hummingbird egg. “Catenate,” which closes the EP, maps the improbably excellent overlap between UK garage and the cardigan twee of Sarah Records, a label whose fierce DIY spirit didn’t exactly translate into musical muscle. The lyrics, too, suggest a Field Mice B-side: “You look so fresh/In your brand new dress/I think I’ll drown,” Nair sings, with the amiable angst of someone who has just got his heart broken on Etsy. In attitude, Snake carries the torch for Blawan’s 2021 and 2023 EPs, Woke Up Right Handed and Dismantled Into Juice, standout records that stripped the carcass of conventional dance music to make a Frankenstein’s monster of scrapyard sound. Nair says that the songs on the Snake EP are “still pretty functional for DJing and stuff” which might be true of the beat-driven thrills of “Snake” or “333333.” But the idiosyncratic shapes of “Worm,” “Sugar Kingdom” and “Catenate” sit somewhere between guaranteed dance-floor hits and DJ self-sabotage, evincing a DGAF spirit that’s punk to the core.",0,"May 22, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nikki-nair-snake-ep/
파란노을 (Parannoul),Sky Hundred,7.9,Rock,"The harshest critic of Parannoul’s music happens to be the person who makes it. Just read the quotes the anonymous Seoul artist posts to their Bandcamp page: “I think these are some kind of magic, that will shine bright for a while and then lights out, like nothing happened”; “He believes he is talented…his singing skills are fucking awful, and is below average in height and appearance and everything.” Even as they’ve emerged as a figurehead of South Korean indie rock and a leading light in an exploding online shoegaze scene, Parannoul are imagining backlash. Though 2023’s After the Magic upgraded their blown-out, lower-than-lo-fi digital shoegaze with stunning results, Sky Hundred trades that deep blue for scorching red—a loud-as-fuck rock record that would be called “back to basics” if Parannoul had ever once sounded like a typical rock band. In contrast to its lush and collaborative predecessor, Sky Hundred is credited entirely to Parannoul. Guitars strum slightly out of time, drums tumble in imperfect rhythms, and on “암​전​고​백 (Lights Off Repentance),” Parannoul play at approximately twice their typical tempo, working up a folk-punk froth that resembles In the Aeroplane Over the Sea way more than Loveless. Is Parannoul working on MIDI with next-generation humanizer settings or were they able to play all of these analog instruments in isolation? Not that Sky Hundred is exactly organic; the “piano” motif on “시계 (Backwards)” is reminiscent of a Skype ringtone. But whereas previous Parannoul songs added or removed layers, Sky Hundred works in dynamics. The opening “주​마​등 (A Lot Can Happen)” breathlessly tries to keep up as the tempo shifts to a breakneck IDM beat. Even if the 14-minute centerpiece “Evoke Me” was spliced together in Pro Tools, the raw elements sound culled from hours of real-time jamming. For all of its tweaks, Sky Hundred is immediately “Parannoul music,” its constituent influences welded together by volume. Shoegaze still has the best claim to an album that uses this much guitar distortion, though in contrast to contemporary gossamer and gauze, Sky Hundred is defined by its presence; the guitars punch rather than soothe and the melodies have the definition of a soda jingle. Though the occasional glimmers of twinkling MIDI guitar that situated To See the Next Part of the Dream in emo’s fifth wave are gone, the spirit of the genre remains in Parannoul’s lyrics, which express countless variations on digital sentimentalism. “Even after everything, I want to believe the feeling lasts forever” (“주​마​등 [A Lot Can Happen]”) or “In the beautiful world I dreamt of, there is no story of me” (“환상 [Fantasy]”) would be the most potent distillation of Parannoul’s POV if it weren’t for the chorus of the aching “황​금​빛 강 (Gold River)”: “I remember memories of memories.” Sky Hundred earns the superlatives one might expect from a “back to basics” album: It’s Parannoul’s most sonically consistent work, and also their shortest. But Parannoul seems aware of the fatigue that sets in with this mode, even at a relatively trim 52 minutes. It’s perfectly understandable to have a one-minute field recording between “Evoke Me” and the equally seismic “시계 (Backwards),” but putting another one between “시계 (Backwards)” and the closing “환상 (Fantasy)” shrinks Side B. The interludes feel less like scene-setting than time-killing, the equivalent of a live band playing ambient drone in the background while the guitarists retune. In fact, Sky Hundred feels less like the follow-up to After the Magic than to the subsequent live album After the Night. Most anonymous artists don’t play live and even fewer release their debut live performance as an album. Parannoul might end up getting unmasked by his legion of fans or many collaborators, but the musician has already started to challenge their reputation as an isolated bedroom act. If their previous two releases sounded like Parannoul was respectively confined to a laptop and a snow globe, Sky Hundred tries to burst through the ceiling while keeping the fourth wall intact.",0,"August 19, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/parannoul-sky-hundred/
Knocked Loose,You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To,8.0,Metal,"The verdict on You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To appears to be well settled among the Knocked Loose faithful. That’s if the reaction videos for “Blinding Faith” are to be trusted—and they probably should, since the lead single of the Kentucky quintet’s titanic fourth album is all reaction shots: That’s a seven-string Ibanez Iceman; oh shit, a SECOND breakdown; 3 members of the band screaming within 5 seconds is fucking god-tier. That’s not entirely accurate because Bryan Garris is not really screaming, but making a death metal gurgle so heinous that it can’t be compared to any actual vocalizing so much as Banned from TV, Joe Theismann’s leg injury or the Alien chest-burster. But can Knocked Loose break out? This sort of question has surrounded the band since they appeared at both Coachella and Bonnaroo in 2023, not just as each festival’s biggest draw in contemporary metal, but the only one, an emissary for the totality of heavy musics for the most casual but curious of listeners. If You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To draws this demographic, it does so as the exact opposite of a “crossover event.” Rather than expanding outward, Knocked Loose have amplified and concentrated their aesthetic into something so dense that it has its own gravitational pull. So, despite what you might assume from those Slipknot opening gigs and the presence of a producer who’s worked with NLE Choppa, Beartooth, and Disturbed in the past two years, there are no clean vocals, no alt-metal choruses or wavy trap drums, no rage-rap guest verses. In short, nothing that might suggest Knocked Loose had reached their logical endpoint with a concept album about a fatal car wreck and could only make their heavy heavier by contrast. They’re a hardcore band in practice, an action/horror franchise in spirit, one that takes its escalating success as a mandate to re-up a self-imposed arms race—the stunts, the thrills, the killshots, they all need to be bigger, badder and bolder before something hungrier takes its place. And if the breakdown has indeed replaced the riff as modern metal’s lingua franca, You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To is about as eloquent as it gets. Bring back the nasty riff but slower? Maybe that was enough in 2016, but “Piece By Piece” is going to bring in a new nasty riff and also an ultra-hammered China cymbal that sounds even gnarlier. Half-time breakdowns? “Thirst” achieves the heretofore inconceivable quarter-time tempo switch, while the Southern shuffle riff on “The Calm That Keeps You Awake” turns Pantera’s “Walk” into a funeral procession. The breakdown on “Don’t Reach For Me” hits, but mostly because there’s at least a half-dozen little teasers of silence where it doesn’t happen first. Of course, any art form reliant on this much physicality can easily devolve into parody without some sort of emotional anchor. Some of the trepidation surrounding You Won’t Go was fixated on the cover art’s implication that Knocked Loose might be a Christian band now. I’d describe it as spiritual, not religious; “Blinding Faith” shouts down any form of dogma, whereas “Don’t Reach For Me” imagines a great, cleansing flood in more of a Taxi Driver way than a biblical one. The album title was taken from a pep talk Garris received from an elderly woman as he stressed through the band’s first post-COVID flight—yes, God’s plan and all, but maybe you’re supposed to go today. Throughout, Garris still sounds like that guy before the conversation, someone who probably would’ve called for a couple of Xanax if his seatmate wasn’t so chatty. It’s fitting that music so reliant on breakdowns takes its lead from someone who sounds like he’s in a constant panic attack. Or, it’s fitting that Knocked Loose’s riffs often mimic the exact sound someone expects to hear on a 737 before a crucial piece of equipment flies off. And yet, none of this means that You Won’t Go is inaccessible. Giving shape to aimless rage, the illicit thrill to imagine playing it for people who have no interest whatsoever in “metal” or anything that ends with “-core,” let alone “metalcore,” the way it makes metal that actively catered towards mainstream tastes sound washed and timid. As a teenager, I remember Far Beyond Driven or Life is Peachy getting on the charts by doing similar things. Or, just go look at those Coachella and Bonnaroo sets—Knocked Loose isn’t playing to empty tents of college kids wishing they were watching Matt Maeson or Jai Wolf instead. Whether Knocked Loose fits into anyone’s perception of what popular metal should sound like, they know they belong. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Killer Mike,"Michael & the Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs for Sinners and Saints",7.0,Rap,"Twenty years ago, Killer Mike was the upstart landing I’m-up-next spots on Jay-Z and Outkast records. His verse on Big Boi’s “Flip Flop Rock,” which features Jay, casts Mike’s good fortune as both salvation and destiny. “I foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme/Focused on every word and line/Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime/I was born to talk shit and prove mine,” he raps with brio. This sense of deliverance has remained a fixture of his work, from the hopeful “gospel music for the ghetto” of his mixtape days, to the rowdy agitprop of R.A.P. Music and Run the Jewels, through last year’s ponderous bildungsroman Michael. He often likens music to a religious experience, zooming in on the ways his career has transported him mentally and materially to a better life. Michael & the Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs for Sinners and Saints continues this tradition. Part remix album, part somber coda to the gospel-influenced Michael, it burrows further into Mike’s formative memories, beliefs, and sounds. Backed by his touring band the Mighty Midnight Revival, and producers and guests from the many eras of his career, Killer Mike cycles through trap, gospel, and Memphis rap as he extols the virtues of staying the course. “I’m bearin’ witness,” he says on the intro, invoking the custom of Southern Black church testimonies. This is rap as outreach. The album comes six months after a whirlwind Grammy night during which Killer Mike won three awards and got arrested for an altercation with a security guard. He describes the evening’s whiplash on the bluesy “Humble Me,” likening his booking to the biblical story of Daniel in the lion’s den and boasting that he was proud to be handcuffed because he shares the experience with his civil rights heroes. After spending the night praying, he’s seemingly rewarded when the next day, his son is confirmed for a kidney transplant. Like many Killer Mike stories, the tale is dramatic and a bit self-aggrandizing—is getting cuffed at the Grammys really the same as being targeted by the FBI?—but Mike’s faith powers his performance. He raps with the conviction of someone who has been touched by the divine and feels newly attuned to its power. The production, mostly helmed by Cuz Lightyear, plays up the feeling of spiritual awakening. The slow, open arrangements use jubilant choir fills, warm keyboard and organ melodies, and swinging rhythms to channel gospel uplift. While a few songs boom and rattle, most sway with relief. “Slummer 4 Junkies” combines the Michael tracks “Slummer” and “Something for Junkies” into a slow-burning epic that swells with the Mighty Midnight Revival’s joyful harmonies and then contracts into a penitent elegy. The songs felt episodic on Michael, but combined they evoke the haze of memory, the narratives blurring together. Mike is still an unabashed Black capitalist preaching a queasy prosperity gospel, but compared to Michael, Songs for Sinners and Saints prioritizes gratitude. Mike dials back the hater screeds and straw man-bashing to revisit his own battles and count his blessings. The shift loosens his rapping, which was somewhat stiff on Michael. On “Had to Go Get It,” he casually transitions from hitting the downbeat to chopping: “Used to sell grams of that white coke on Ponce de Leon to white folk/Knew to do better, but I wanted cheddar, so dance with the devil/Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did it.” Over a slick flip of Trillville’s crunk anthem “Neva Eva” on the bouncy standout “Higher Level,” Mike thanks his wife for confronting him about cheating. “I had a wife, girlfriend, and mistress, good fella like I was Henry/’Til I woke up with that trey-eight to my face held by my missus,” he raps. Songs for Sinners and Saints doesn’t cover as much ground as Michael, which offered the rich multi-genre sprawl of a classic Dungeon Family release. But the narrower palette and lower stakes of the project restore the focus and play of his “Snappin’ & Trappin” days, when he approached rap as a calling rather than a pulpit. “’97 3-6 Freestyle,” produced by DJ Paul and TWhy, delivers all the hallmarks of a Killer Mike song: Jesus, Martin Luther King Jr., and Coretta Scott King; Memphis-inspired triplets; sneers about elitists and broke people. But even the familiar beats exist in service of his relentless soul-searching. He sounds like a believer—in his God, in his talent, and in rap as a hallowed art.

潘Pan,Pan the Pansexual,6.5,Electronic,"For 潘PAN, the body is a bomb about to explode. On the 2015 Grimes track “Scream,” her voice fluttered across Mandarin lyrics about howls packed deep in the lungs like gunpowder; between delicate rap verses, she let those subdued screams erupt. The Taiwanese musician born Pan Wei Ju, previously known as Aristophanes, has toyed with the boundary between composed beauty and volcanic monstrosity ever since. On Pan the Pansexual, her first full-length release since renaming herself, 潘PAN turns her attention toward the existential threat of sexual desire, and how its satisfaction can liquefy one’s sense of identity just as easily as it can crystalize it. In 2017, 潘PAN followed her indelible Grimes feature with the mixtape Humans Become Machines, a lively, populous release that showcased a wide range of vocal moods: playful, introspective, frenetic, furious. It was a colorful affair. By contrast, Pan the Pansexual crouches in an unrelentingly bleak corner. Its beats lurch and scuttle, decaying out of time, drumming up echoes of 2010s goth records like Gazelle Twin’s Unflesh. On “Embers,” 潘PAN raps in Mandarin and sings in English over a jazzy loop whose swung rhythm scrapes against the oppressive atmosphere. The skittering cymbals hint at levity, but the synthesizer washes and pained lyrics hover in the gloom. “If I somehow die in my endless depression, I want all my beautiful illusions keep alive,” she sings in a breathy upper register while a minor-key piano figure twinkles deep in the fog. On “Reborn,” one of two tracks produced by cloud rap phenom Clams Casino, 潘PAN braids together wordless keens that call to mind Jarboe’s solo work. Here, she envisions new life emerging from violent death: “Choke me slowly with your old scars/Make me bloom once again with your blood,” she sings right before a string interlude injects a sense of old-world gothic romance into Clams’ digital static. Similar tensions simmer throughout the album. When they do resolve, they pour forth in a fury. On “FNGRMEHRDR,” over a bassline descended from Le Tigre’s electroclash classic “Deceptacon,” 潘PAN sings about a voracious desire that belies deeper longing: “I never, ever felt this lonely/Fuck it, finger me harder.” Her Mandarin lyrics, delivered at a more agitated clip, depict a totally alienated sexual encounter. “My bones are soft like mud now, my consciousness collapses, when you kiss me like the way flood spreads,” she raps. “I turned out to be a lonely person since I met you... you are making me incomplete.” Pan the Pansexual arrives during the summer of Chappell Roan and Billie Eilish, two artists who sing about queer sex as neon relief from uncertainty and repression. Roan’s “Red Wine Supernova” is an outpouring of sensual joy, while Eilish’s “LUNCH” hits like a long exhale at the end of a breath held for years. 潘PAN’s own grappling with sexual identity traces a more tortured path. What if pursuing your secret hunger didn’t calm the incalculable questions writhing in your mind, but only deepened them? What if getting off didn’t actually mean getting out? That’s the fear weighing heavy over this album—that it’s not always so easy to come home into your own body. Sometimes the bomb goes off and the question hangs in the air, unanswered.",0,"July 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pan-pan-the-pansexual/
Tems,Born in the Wild,7.8,Pop/R&B,"Tems was born in candlelight. “There was no electricity when my mom gave birth to me,” she told NPR. “It was night in my life for so long that, like, I just thought it was never coming.” Twenty-eight years later, the Grammy-winning Nigerian artist finds herself in the glare of the global spotlight. Born in the Wild revisits the shadows with clarity and confidence. In her earlier EPs, the Afro-fusion singer revealed her spellbinding prowess; with her debut full-length, she re-asserts herself as an imaginative producer and the author of her own lore. Tems remains her own sole songwriter, confronting the pressures of stardom through a tender, melancholic exploration of pre-fame traumas. Each song evokes a kaleidoscope of emotions, but whether addressing a higher power (“Me & U”) or reflecting on an ill-fated romance (“Unfortunate”), Tems remains focused on gratitude. On the acoustic guitar-guided opener and title track, her voice emerges as if she’s singing beside a dying campfire, piano twinkling in the sky above. Distilling her music to its essence, Born in the Wild opts for a stripped-down ’90s vibe, affording Tems the serenity to explore her innermost thoughts. Tems self-produced much of the LP alongside GuityBeatz, the Ghanaian Afropop DJ behind her 2021 EP If Orange Was a Place. The polyrhythmic soundscape, adorned with the earthy tones of conga drums, wind chimes, and shekere rattles, provides a counterweight to the homogenized sound of contemporary Afropop. In songs like “Love Me JeJe” and the Diana King-interpolating “Gangsta,” she marries vintage African music with modern R&B, dancehall, and pop, writing a love letter to the past and a message for the future. The former song is a sparkly refresh of Nigerian singer Seyi Sodimu’s 1997 call-and-response classic: “All the old heads in Nigeria, they looove this song,” she said during a recent Tiny Desk concert. “Wickedest” features a sample from Ivorian quartet Magic System’s “1er Gaou”—an iconic zouglou hit from the early aughts that triggers memories for Africans everywhere. Tems’ unembellished arrangements feel old-school and lived-in. Accompanied by jazz fusion guitarist Nsikak David on “Boy O Boy,” she conjures an ambiance of solitude as lavish as a hotel lounge ensconced in velvet. On standout “Burning,” she processes her inner turmoil in a lilting singsong, letting her vocals become the luminous core of the music. On “Forever,” which is produced by Brummie duo DAMEDAME* but sounds like a Kaytranada groove, Tems’ bassy timbre ascends to a floaty falsetto reminiscent of a young Michael Jackson. She channels 50 Cent and Lauryn Hill for the hip-hop track “T-Unit,” flexing her rap skills while staying true to the album’s melancholic mood. Across a generous 18 tracks, Born in the Wild has the feel of a sprawling mood board, incorporating the undercurrent of Tems’ Christian faith, the melismatic cadences that mirror her fluctuating self-assurance, and refrains that blur affirmation and rumination. Her artistry is undeniable, though the album could’ve benefitted from a focused edit. The interludes, featuring snippets of her mother and managers, could have been pared back, or perhaps omitted. Afrobeats heavyweight Sarz produces “Get It Right,” a fun amapiano feature with Asake, but the song’s commercial sheen disrupts the album’s studied chiaroscuro. J. Cole’s verse on “Free Fall” also under-delivers; I would’ve much preferred Tems’ 2023 single “Not an Angel,” another Sarz production that surprisingly didn’t make the cut. Born in the Wild, much like Tems the artist, is a slow burn that rewards patience. Closer “Hold On” sounds like the light at the end of the tunnel. “This is for the girl in the dark,” she sings, her voice now bathed in sun. “You’re gonna find it, it’s gonna find you…it’s the one in you.” In her past EPs, Tems ran from the darkness. On Born in the Wild, she makes peace with its permanence.",0,"June 13, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tems-born-in-the-wild/
Thou,Umbilical,7.9,Metal,"Thou have always reveled in misanthropy. Onstage, the band might antagonize a disengaged audience by taunting them, or turning around and ignoring them. In lyric sheets, they paint humankind as a failed endeavor, once full of potential for good but chronically unable to pry itself from pitfalls as old as civilization itself. This outright disdain is one of the few things that Thou will cop to sharing with the Louisiana sludge-metal forebears, like Eyehategod and Crowbar, to whom they’re frequently compared. Despite obvious similarities in geography, aggression, the lacerating use of guitar feedback, and a stylistic blend of doom metal’s murk and hardcore’s nastiness, Thou have never accepted the sludge mantle. Vocalist Bryan Funck has repeatedly suggested a closer kinship to another decades-old regional scene: Seattle grunge. Thou have amassed a staggering repertoire of grunge covers over the years, and it’s clear that their affinity goes beyond a cheeky fondness for Nirvana. Nevertheless, the band’s own abrasive, atypical, and often meandering compositions can make Funck’s determination to keep sludge at arm’s length seem a little precious. Not even the Melvins at their heaviest have ever sounded a fraction as ugly. But on Umbilical, Thou make their grunge lineage more explicit while maintaining the intensity of their all-encompassing contempt. “Essentially, it’s a diss record,” Funck said of the album in a recent interview. “But I’m dissing Thou.” He turns the magnifying glass on himself, interrogating the anarcho-DIY ethos he’s held since adolescence against the backdrop of the compromises that Thou have made to further their careers. “Everything you’ve ever done, everything you’ve ever said, everything you’ve ever felt is a dagger on my belt,” he shrieks on “Emotional Terrorist,” before flipping his perspective: “Everything I’ve ever done, everything I’ve ever said, everything I’ve ever felt is a chain around my neck.” It might seem like this insistent self-loathing calls for Thou’s most gnarled music yet, but instead we get the band at its most streamlined. This is their first album (excepting collaborations) with no tracks over seven minutes, and none of the brief interludes that the band is fond of. Everything is a song, and most of these songs even abide by something close to standard pop structure. Umbilical is no less heavy than any other Thou album—it might be their heaviest yet—but it no longer requires mental gymnastics to call this music grunge. Maybe it’s Alice in Chains starring in The Crow: murdered by a gang and resurrected in ghastlier form to seek vengeance. Maybe it’s Nirvana after Cobain makes a deal with the Devil, surviving the ’90s but cursed to make progressively more fucked-up albums (Umbilical is perhaps two or three iterations past In Utero). Lead single “I Feel Nothing When You Cry” blusters in with uncharacteristically busy drumming from Tyler Coburn and thick, humid fumes rising from Andrew Gibbs’ and Matthew Thudium’s guitar amps. It sounds like 12 people queuing up “Geek U.S.A.,” all pressing play at once, and feeding the results through a wall of mangled speakers. Umbilical is a faster, hookier version of Thou, more prone to impish check this out feats—like building up to a breaking point in the middle of “I Feel Nothing When You Cry,” stopping on a dime, then shifting the groove and melody ever so slightly—than grimacing I dare you to survive this flagellation. This playfulness extends to lyrical references in unlikely places. The outwardly despondent “I Return as Chained and Bound to You” takes its closing refrain from a Mighty Boosh sketch; on “House of Ideas,” Funck slips in the central line of Billy Joel’s “Movin’ Out (Anthony’s Song)” right before a crushing breakdown. Where previous Thou albums gestured at alt-rock tropes with a sense of remove, Umbilical leaves more connective tissue intact. The 2018 Rhea Sylvia EP and 2020’s full-length collaboration with Emma Ruth Rundle, May Our Chambers Be Full, feel like clear predecessors, but their gothic overtones and/or devotion to slower tempos ensured different results than Umbilical’s pulse-quickening anthems. Low-slung, Cantrellian riffs like those on “The Promise” aren’t alien territory for Thou, but the fact that they’re delivered at 120 BPM alongside a hummable vocal hook is a welcome surprise. For all of Thou’s provocation, experimentation, and obfuscation, it’s not like they’ve ever been a difficult band to enjoy. Maybe their most accurate grunge analog is Pearl Jam, whose refusal to play by the rules outlined by MTV and Ticketmaster belied their identity as one of the poppiest, most earnest bands of the genre’s first wave. Thou are a blast even when Funck is digging into esoteric philosophy over the slowest riff you’ve ever heard, but it’s refreshing to hear them get real with themselves, jogging their music out of the enthralling but insular world they’ve created over the past 15-plus years. No one is ever going to accuse Thou of selling out. They’ve put in the work; they deserve to have some fun. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Water Damage,In E,7.7,Rock,"Forget music that makes you feel no pain. What about music that makes you feel like nothing at all, that pushes and pulverizes you until every woe, hope, and worry disappears like dust? That is the marvelous strength of Water Damage, an amorphous collective of about a dozen Austin underground heads whose high-volume indulgence in repetition is a force both obliterative and purifying. They ride the divide between noise and rock, pounding out rhythms like a power trio caught on an eternal trip to nowhere, all beneath feedback streaks and microtonal bleats. In New York in the late ’70s, the Ramones at CBGB inspired young composer and avant-impresario Rhys Chatham to repeat an electrified E above drums until the overtones turned into a fever dream, the vision fulfilled by his Guitar Trio. Nearly half a century later, Water Damage have turned that challenge into an obstacle course with In E, their third and best album and a reaffirming testament to just how ecstatic and mighty minimalism can be. In E arrives as four side-long tracks, each charging down a single alleyway without ever wavering, glancing back, or bothering to do anything more than shift in barely perceptible ways. “Nice!” someone seems to yell 15 seconds into “Reel E,” the phosphorescent violin and colossal rhythm section presumably pausing just long enough to check the levels. And then, their marathon begins, blown-out bass and brain-fried guitar unfolding like an imagined ocean. The drums fall in line like a marching band, at least two kits shaping an ironclad pocket. But the bristled violin of Mari Maurice Rubio—who records as the great more eaze—slices through the sides of the beat like she’s trying to make an escape. And that’s mostly where the piece hangs until the band breaks down and Maurice outlasts the rhythm long enough to sail into this open void. Loud, relentless, unrepentant: Lock into that tug of war, and you may forget where you are, how you are, who you are. It feels fantastic, a rare mind eraser for our increasingly plugged-in times. Water Damage unlock the same effect on “Reel EE” and “Reel EEE” with very different approaches. For the former, the rhythm section summons a rock band that’s about to count in to their greatest hit, but they simply sit there, repeating the meter and doubling the bass until it all blurs into a trance. Don’t expect it to change when the guitars finally arrive, either, their slow wave of serrated tones washing over everything like insoluble oil. It is a web of interwoven drones, with feedback, distortion, and fragmented chords cohering into sustained chaos. “Can textures alone make a riff?” Water Damage seem to ask. The Motorik march compels you to nod along whether or not you agree. “Reel EEE,” on the other hand, begins with the hum, its amplifier buzz and scraped strings slowly accreting into some demonic instrumental choir. Imagine Appalachia’s great Pelt, plugging in and zoning out. When at last the drums come, they swing like a GIF of someone dancing to disco on an endless loop. That beat bullies the layers apart, so that you can hear the collective hum’s individual threads—the plangent guitar, the shrieking violin, the plucked strings. Focus on any of them long enough, and again you’ll disappear, lost and locked inside a beautiful melee. When the tape runs out 15 minutes later, you may ask where the time has gone, maybe wonder if the clock itself has somehow skipped. Water Damage, of course, are not the first band to muster these sorts of barrages. Whether their particular headwaters are somewhere in Germany at the start of the ’70s or in Memphis and the Delta below decades earlier, their path runs through the Grateful Dead and no wave, Load Records, and, more recently, 75 Dollar Bill. They nod to this lineage of proud cacophony with closer “Ladybird,” a demented 2005 opus of Austin-via-London project Shit and Shine. Much like Water Damage, Shit and Shine can expand and contract as needed, incorporating guests and stretching jams until last call. (Shit and Shine henchman Craig Clouse plays in USA/Mexico with Water Damage’s Nate Cross alongside King Coffey of another obvious antecedent, Butthole Surfers.) And, again, much like Water Damage, Clouse once described Shit and Shine as “Repetition. Noise. A little humor.” As Water Damage near the end of their 20-minute romp through “Ladybird”—where distorted guitars surge through militant drums only to be swallowed up again, where the vocals sound like they’ve been trapped in a heat-warped spool of magnetic tape for decades—you hear that humor. This is gloriously absurd music, pushing rock ’n’ roll toward a threshold at which you either have to submit or simply walk away. Just go for it already. In October 1972, Tony Conrad—the iconoclastic violinist who had helped name the Velvet Underground and helped give La Monte Young’s eternal music its theoretical underpinning—rendezvoused with the ever-mischievous Faust in Hamburg. Their session, Outside the Dream Syndicate, became a hypnotic classic, Conrad’s drone tunneling through the thrum like it a rusty razor blade. But Conrad often dismissed that record, saying they all sounded like hippies. That was especially damning for that moment, as the Vietnam War’s chthonic horrors reached new lows. The late Conrad might have loved Water Damage. On In E, they start from the same basic premise—put a big beat beneath a wild drone—and howl, offering none of the sense of safety or quarter Conrad must have heard in Outside the Dream Syndicate. Water Damage roar and rage against the troubles of our own time, their volume and power making you forget for at least 20 minutes at a clip. And then, they start again.",0,"April 22, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/water-damage-in-e/
Cavalier,Different Type Time,8.0,Rap,"Somewhere in Brooklyn, New Orleans, or Oakland, there’s a corner apartment with a window propped open. A slight breeze gently pushes the curtains aside to let the sunshine in, noises from the street below sneaking behind it. Thin ribbons of smoke from a smoldering cone, either weed or incense (but probably both), perfume the room while a gust of wind flutters notebook pages full of long-forgotten observations. There’s an undeniable wisdom that lives in moments like these, cultivated through the simplicity of attuning to the sights, smells, and space around you. If you tap into that energy, you might even bridge the past and present, connecting with something larger than yourself. That sense of spirituality permeates Different Type Time, Cavalier’s sumptuous and sublime new album. It’s in the record’s hushed mysticism: Characters perform honey jar spells or clutch copies of the Circle 7 Koran to their chest; some form of God is always present in the margins of songs, appearing as a Black woman, a mother, or the buds of a cannabis plant. It’s in the warm, beatific production Cavalier chooses, every gossamer string, lilting guitar, or sparkling piano loosely orbiting around crisp, unobtrusive drums. On “Pears,” he raps, “It’s vibrational, ain’t it” four times, using repetition to tune in to higher frequencies. Throughout the album, Cavalier constantly harmonizes with the cosmos to ground himself within the chaos. Cav is originally from Brooklyn, but landed in New Orleans about a decade ago. He and his frequent collaborators Quelle Chris and Iman Omari were previously bicoastal, convening to work on music in New York, Omari’s hometown of Los Angeles, or whatever West Coast enclave Quelle was living in at the moment. Cav and Omari eventually settled in NOLA, where the pair made 2015’s LemOnade EP and 2018’s Private Stock, the latter of which has become something of a minor cult classic among contemplative underground rap fans. Those records reflected the pair’s new Southern home, including Omari’s take on warm jazz and Cav’s ruminations on NOLA’s struggles with gentrification and police brutality. For Different Type Time, Cav recruits a new slate of producers, expanding his palette but retaining his previous works’ humid thrum. He’s still concerned with his surroundings but turns further inward, the record playing like conversations between different eras of himself. It’s hard to catch the depth of Cav’s writing upon first listen, as he frequently employs double entendres and clever innuendos, burying them in thickets of labyrinthine flows. It can be outright dizzying, like the brain-frying wordplay in the middle of “Doodoo Damien:” “Flex on the rest of you bitches and that ain’t gender ‘pacific’/That’s all coast, almost kings—Edward, King James, not Olmos/That’s American me, where Eric B. for President set precedence with me.” He finds the connective tissue between disparate thoughts, his verses resembling a heat map visualization of the brain’s firing synapses. Over the slow-motion calypso rhythms of “Come Proper,” Cav invokes the writer bell hooks, wishes his exes well, and stubs out a joint in an overflowing ashtray—all within the first eight bars. On the Quelle Chris-produced “Flourish,” amidst a flurry of self-confident boasts about his skills and wardrobe, Cav takes a moment to contemplate the difference between optimism and hope, noting: “My granny cops new lotto tickets while the doom clock’s ticking.” He’ll often interrupt his own knotty stanzas with calming images, as if he’s reminding himself to drop his shoulders and unclench his jaw. By the end of “Can’t Leave It Alone,” when he’s worked himself into a tizzy debating the internal pressures of his perceived potential, he pauses to prune a bonsai tree. In between pondering death and sex on “Yeah Boiii,” he peels a Satsuma orange. Throughout the album, Cav grounds himself in the craft. He’s a self-professed hip-hop nerd, peppering verses with allusions to Cooley High and Bob James’ perpetually sampled “Nautilus,” or repurposing lines from Ol’ Dirty Bastard, A Tribe Called Quest, or Jay-Z songs. The backlit boom-bap beat that producer foushou. provides for the mid-album highlight “Told You” prompts Cav to find a pocket like a young Nas, creating an introverted, alternate-dimension version of “The World Is Yours.” Though he’s undeniably a student of the ’90s golden era, Cav shows clear reverence for that sound without overtly trying to recreate it. When he does have the rare wistful old head moment, it comes off as charming, never scolding. The only two guest rappers, credited as Unhoused Brothers in the liner notes, are men Cav met serendipitously while traveling to cities where his producers lived. One has his own song, “Baby I’m Home,” while the other appears at the end of “Told You” and “Axiom / My Gawd.” Both of these encounters occurred on the same day—the first moments before Cav left Detroit, the second shortly after he landed in Dallas. Cav has said in interviews that he made Different Type Time as a reaction to the breathless oversaturation and mindless overconsumption of the streaming age. The inclusion of these recordings on an album six years in the making solidifies Different Type Time as a poignant meditation on presence: The world moves too quickly, and there’s too much to process at any given time, but if you’re able to slow down—even for just a moment—you’ll find insight to gain and beauty to experience, folding into the cosmic energy that surrounds us all.",0,"April 26, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cavalier-different-type-time/
Silver Jews,The Natural Bridge,9.2,Rock,"Let’s say it doesn’t work out. You cross over from adolescence to adulthood and wind up living a life you didn’t choose. The rooms are depressing and fluorescent; the people who once offered comfort grow distant; any ambition for the future is replaced with a somewhat nauseating impulse just to get through the day. David Berman sings to one such person in “Pretty Eyes,” at the very end of The Natural Bridge, an album he made when he was 29. His friends and collaborators in Pavement were achieving a type of success that must have seemed like a dream back when he and Stephen Malkmus first met as students at the University of Virginia. Pavement had something that could conceivably be called a hit single; their videos were in frequent rotation on MTV; they were reaching the masses from festival stages and rave reviews. Meanwhile, Berman had been living in Amherst to study under the tutelage of his hero, the poet James Tate. “To do that, I got into this MFA program,” he told Frequency Magazine in 1999, “and found out I could go up there for three years and not work. It was great.” After several failed attempts at making a second record—the follow-up to 1994’s Starlite Walker, a shaggy, lovable album he made with Malkmus, Bob Nastanovich, and Steve West—he got together with some local musician friends in Massachusetts. At the end of the sessions, they watched as he strummed through “Pretty Eyes,” sleep-deprived and hell-bent on getting it all right in one take. In the opening verse, he sings these words: I can see you in your room at nightThe pictures on your wallsLittle forest scenes and high school HalloweensBut they don’t come to youThey don’t come to you at all As far as Silver Jews lyrics go, these ones are fairly straightforward. He sings in the second person to someone he can access only in his mind. He recognizes they are at a stage in life when their escapist fantasies and childhood memories are equally out of grasp, more useful for locating the pains of the present. He offers this song—which ends on the romantic promise of “I’ll always remember your pretty eyes”—as a means of consolation and farewell. This particular bedroom isn’t the only place where The Natural Bridge grants us access. There’s a barroom where a lonely man avoids his reflection in the mirror; an abandoned drive-in theater with ivy growing over the screen. Nearly every setting on The Natural Bridge illustrates his worldview through some sense of deterioration. The scenery is always dripping and creaking; people are shaking and shivering; the perspective is grayscale and bleak. While recording the album, Berman felt haunted by the graveyards of Massachusetts and a truck parked outside the recording studio, a former gun factory, bearing initials that spelled out “G.O.D.” Listen closely and you might start seeing God, too. “Liking The Natural Bridge is liking me at my ostensible worst,” Berman said in one of his final interviews. He died in 2019, leaving behind a catalog with no real weak points, so the “worst” in his assessment seems less about the quality of the work than his state of mind: the first time in his career when his art seemed beamed from some desolate terrain that he could not escape. Due to the tragic circumstances of his life and a mythology he couldn’t help but spur on (“I always loved bands with mystique,” he confessed), this burnt-out mood is probably the closest to how people remember his music. Even when he’s telling jokes, resisting sentimentality to the point of abandoning meaning at all, his questions are naked and troubling and unignorable. Much of the brilliance of Berman’s work gets boiled down to his writing, but The Natural Bridge is a memorably atmospheric record—the types of songs you return to both for what they express and how they make you feel. Even beyond the melodies, this is an album full of texture. Just as you could spend an entire essay running through the lyric sheet, there are almost too many sonic moments to list. The way the snare drum harrumphs uninvited into “How to Rent a Room.” The muted soft-rock piano of “Dallas” that sits atop the arrangement like a stubborn layer of snow on a rooftop. The whip of white noise as he sings about the death of a pet in “Pet Politics” or the gorgeous ripple of acoustic guitar and piano that kickstarts his verse about the Bible a minute later. Backed by members of the Amherst band New Radiant Storm King, Berman introduced a lineup of Silver Jews that existed for only one record. (They did not tour the album, and, as far as I know, there are no outtakes.) This was the only band who seemingly aspired to Spiderland as much as Beggars Banquet, and they were the most tethered to the therapeutic nature of his writing process. “Almost everyone I’ve told that it was a sad record said it doesn't sound sad at all,” he observed to The Independent upon release. “I think recording was a process of calming myself down, and it might come across that way.” Part of what the album teaches is patience, an invitation to carry the art into the world and see how the passing of time affects your understanding. Maybe one day you will hear “Bring It on Home to Me” on the radio and notice the line that Berman inverts in “How to Rent a Room” (“I know you laughed when I left/But you only really hurt yourself”), putting its narrator in conversation with Sam Cooke from the other side of the door. These connections are even designed into the packaging, like the quote from the Gospel of Thomas printed on the record label in reverse, so fans would have to hold it to a mirror to read it. The idea is to catch your own reflection, to recognize yourself, to notice how much we overlook every day. This level of intimacy may be why the people who love Silver Jews tend to really love Silver Jews. And the people who love this record tend to really love this record. “There’s two kinds of Silver Jews fans,” Berman once said, “the ones who favor The Natural Bridge and the others.” Where other career staples like American Water offer a greater sense of melodic uplift, Tanglewood Numbers presents a more energized band, and even Purple Mountains extends his universe with warmer, richer arrangements, The Natural Bridge is as direct and unflinching as his music ever sounded. In an indispensable piece of reporting for Stereogum, in 2016, Ryan H. Walsh detailed the process of bringing this album, tirelessly, to life. Here, you get all the details you could want about the album’s creation. There were the aborted sessions with Scud Mountain Boys, the alt-country band led by Joe Pernice, another songwriter who obtained a poetry MFA at Amherst. There were the planned sessions with Malkmus, Nastonovich, and West, which Berman flaked on, thus giving Pavement studio time to make what would become the Pacific Trim EP. Once the record finally got set in motion, there are mythical stories of Berman instructing his bandmates to match his frayed, sleepless state of mind (“He urged me to play like my feet were sopping wet,” recalled guitarist Peyton Pinkerton) and speaking at length about each song to help them embody the words. There’s a scene of him lying behind the drum set, writhing in “psychic agony,” before delivering his vocals. There’s the sense, once the record is released, that it failed to justify the great lengths he and his collaborators went through to make it, not to mention the hype afforded to him by his proximity to Pavement. “I thought I’d made a terrible mistake,” Berman said of the immediate aftermath. But what exactly did he want to gain from this music? After all, so much of his writing exists to document the sad fixtures who live just outside the spotlight: the other house in New Orleans that didn’t make the cut in “The House of the Rising Sun,” the other guy in the Garden of Eden whom Adam killed before he could develop a storyline. His most iconic lyric involves “approaching perfection,” and even that he describes as something akin to sickness. “I make art out of hostility,” he confessed to The Guardian in 2002. “I started writing poems because I wanted to make poems so good they would make everyone else quit. I don’t have the voice or the technical skills to blow people away with my music.” There is some truth to this statement. In 1999, Actual Air, the extraordinary result of Berman’s MFA thesis, would garner praise from poet laureate Billy Collins, formative influences like James Tate, and even a glowing review in The New York Times. These are mainstream accolades that it’s difficult to imagine being granted to even the most accessible Silver Jews album at the time. And yet, so much of Berman’s art encourages us not to seek this type of validation. Even that Times critic reviewing Actual Air had to admit he sometimes had no clue what was going on. Using a metaphor from Berman’s poem called “The Moon”—where a man who buys a car, part-by-part, is thrilled to receive an ashtray and wheel in the mail—David Kirby writes that Berman’s more impressionistic writing merely “present the reader with a jumble of shiny pieces that don’t necessarily add up to a whole car.” Where Berman’s poems might ask us to fill in the blanks, The Natural Bridge shows the crucial way his music could add to our understanding. Take a line like this: “Time, cum, sand, and surf/These are the building blocks of life.” As it appears in the lyric sheet, you might imagine someone misremembering a Jimmy Buffett song with a smirk. But in “The Frontier Index,” the band accompanies this line with claustrophobic, post-punk momentum, as Berman repeats the word “building” with a stutter, his delivery cavernous and steely, like this may be the last wisdom he’ll be able to impart. And so what if it is? Could any other last words be more profound? Maybe Berman’s tense relationship with this record was due to this urgency. He spoke about how difficult it was to listen to any music after its completion, both because of the intensity of the recording and the strange anticlimax of its arrival. But there is also an exhaustive feeling to the music. From hints of the ’80s goth sound that made him first fall in love with music (among the sole recordings from the aborted Scud Mountain Boy sessions was an Echo and the Bunnymen cover that has allegedly since been destroyed) to deeper dives into the classic country that would define his later work, each song attempts to expand the definition of what a Silver Jews song could be. Say what you want about his drawling, affectless vocal delivery or the hopeless nature of his writing. But you can’t say he wasn’t trying. Which, as so often in the adult world, leads to disappointment. Hence “Ballad of Reverend War Character,” whose lyrics consist almost entirely of brief, morbid character studies, zooming through entire lives as if skimming through the obits and skipping to the endings. In lieu of a chorus, he offers little pearls of wisdom after each verse. “In a horror movie when the car won’t start/You give it one last try,” goes one, returning to the feeling of terror that courses through the record. Another: “In space there is no center/We’re always off to the side.” I’ve returned to this lyric many times, and I am always astounded by how much it conveys in so few words. There’s the rebuttal of a cliché—not only are we not the center of the universe, but there is no center at all. There’s also a seemingly teachable lesson, a way to ponder our insignificance that feels so particularly Berman that I imagine nobody else in the world could identify whether it was a source of comfort or anxiety to him. “Well, don’t believe in people who say it’s all been done/They have time to talk because their race is run,” he sang on 1994’s “Advice to the Graduate,” and here was his impetus for moving forward: to keep learning, to say something true. At the very least, he was able to find a definition of success far from the goalposts he was raised with in Dallas. In a 1999 interview, he talks about the grim view of corporate adult life afforded to him by visits to his father’s notorious work in government affairs and PR. These characters and images would drift through his writing forever: the frosted bank glass, the buildings made of mirrors. “He put the fear into me early on… that I would live a life inside of those worlds,” Berman explains, “and I’ve been able to escape it so far… It’s a terrifying world.” Maybe this is the world where the character in “Pretty Eyes” lives. Maybe it’s where the guy in “Inside the Golden Days of Missing You” is coming from before he gets to the bar. Maybe it’s what the narrator of “How to Rent a Room” is running from, imagining his death in the eyes of the people he once knew. In the following decade, Berman would find true love and religion, release an influential collection of poetry and several more beloved records, tour the world and meet people who found comfort and meaning in his work. Things, of course, would also get bad. But he tried to strike a balance. “There’s been moments where I felt aging was a process of decay,” he told Dolomite Magazine in 1999, “but the last few years have been the best of my life, and it seems to get better.” The Natural Bridge, in its stark and defenseless way, looks to the future with resistance and desperation. It awakens with a sense that life has begun. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Post Malone,F-1 Trillion,7.0,Folk/Country / Rap / Pop/R&B,"Is country a lifestyle or an accessory? Depends on who you ask. Presently it’s fashionable to try and bridge that gap. Blue-state dwellers with email jobs are dressing up like duck hunters, donning Carhartt and Realtree camo to the warehouse rave or wine bar. Costumed as a rodeo queen, Beyoncé waved the stars and stripes on the cover of her country album earlier this spring. In the video for July’s “Tough,” Quavo rocked cutoffs and an A-frame, play-acting homestead fantasies with Lana Del Rey as she extolled the virtues of being tough as leather boots. Despite Spotify’s best efforts to fill any idle moment with “That’s that me espresso,” the song of the summer is Shaboozey’s country-fried flip of an old ringtone rap hit. “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” an ode to drowning your 9-to-5 sorrows with double shots of Jack, has spent the past five weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. Currently just behind it is “I Had Some Help,” another twangy drinkin’ anthem, this one by Morgan Wallen and Post Malone. With frizzy braids, glazed eyes and a debut single called “White Iverson,” Post Malone emerged in 2015 as a reflection of the zeitgeist, echoing the slurry melodies of exquisitely medicated rappers. Post spent his teenage years in the Dallas suburbs, playing guitar in hardcore bands and rapping over bedroom beats. The 19-year-old’s first SoundCloud upload racked up a million plays in a month, though he looked a little goofy in the “White Iverson” video dabbing on the hood of a rented Rolls Royce. “I’m not a rapper,” he insisted in a 2016 profile, calling genre a restrictive, dated notion, but rappers were always saying things like that. A few months after his breakthrough, Post tweeted late one night: “WHEN I TURN 30 IM BECOMING A COUNTRY/FOLK SINGER.” As it turns out, F-1 Trillion, Post Malone’s first country album, arrives early in his 29th year, born as he was on the 4th of July. The months prior unfolded like an elaborate debutante ball: In a pearl-snap shirt and bootcut jeans he made his Stagecoach premiere in April, introducing himself by his government name (Austin Richard Post) before a set of country covers heavy on ’90s hits. Emerging from the crowd at CMA Fest in June, he joined Wallen to perform their new duet—a song as rotely catchy as anything on the Tennessee titan’s One Thing at a Time, the biggest album of 2023. “Welcome to country music, Post Malone!” Blake Shelton crowed as the pair debuted “Pour Me a Drink,” F-1 Trillion’s second single, beaming at each other all the while. The song was nothing crazy—your standard fare on the redemptive powers of cracking a cold one—but Post looked as happy as you’d ever seen him, taking off his camo cap to accept the wild applause. It’s a credit to Post’s charisma that choice lines from that single (“I been breakin’ my back just keeping up with the Joneses!” sings the man with more diamond-certified songs than any artist in history) don’t rankle as they should. Instead, the superstar’s shift to fun, low-stakes pop-country feels so right, you wonder why it took so long. The way Post tells it, Nashville was daunting to a guy accustomed to simply stepping in the booth—where does one even get a band? But last year, he began hosting Bud Light-fueled writing sessions with Music City’s heavy hitters: Luke Combs (of “Fast Car” cover fame), Ernest Keith Smith, Michael Hardy, Ashley Gorley, Charlie Handsome, James McNair. If you’ve ever scanned the credits of a Morgan Wallen record, you’ve seen most of these names. Theirs is the sound of the country charts, and by extension the charts at large, at a moment when the genre’s bigger than it’s been in decades. What exactly is that sound? It’s smoother than the blustering bro-country of the 2010s, with sanded-down edges and aerodynamic verses that tumble pleasantly into hooks. These tricky little songs are powered by momentum, and yet they’re oddly wordy, overburdened by their “cleverness.” On the Luke Combs duet “Guy for That,” Post delivers a more colorful version of this formula than Wallen, void of aura, could ever hope for. “I got a guy to sight in my rifle/My mama’s new boyfriend rebinds bibles,” Post warbles winningly, setting up an A1 concept. He’s got a guy for everything, except the thing he really needs—to unbreak his ex’s heart. Wait, what? Under a bit of scrutiny, the whole thing comes apart. Would it go off nonetheless on a dive bar patio amidst a rousing game of cornhole? Buddy, you got that right. You needn’t get too deep into the weeds of F-1 Trillion to sense that Post is shy about his place in country music in a way he never seemed to be in rap. Of the album’s 18 tracks, he handles three alone: a halfway-decent love song, a ballad for his daughter on her future wedding day, a synth-pop slow dance number (“What Don’t Belong To Me”) perhaps left off his last record and gussied up with pedal steel. The rest are duets with country’s luminaries, then and now. Where Beyoncé got an interlude, Post wrangles a true Dolly Parton collab on “Have the Heart,” a Texas two-stepper on which the 78-year-old icon introduces her verse: “Wanna hear somethin’ sssexy?” On “Losers,” a stomp-clap anthem for the demimonde dwellers (“Last callers, last chancers, 9-to-5ers, truckers, dancers”), Post borrows some pathos from Jelly Roll, the Tennessee rapper turned folk balladeer whose success on the CMT circuit paved the way for guys with face tattoos to be embraced by a fanbase famous for its gatekeeping. In the late ’90s and 2000s Post’s dad worked as a wedding DJ, spinning the era’s sunny country hits into the rap and rock songs of the day. Post represents this era on F-1 Trillion’s bloated midsection, fitting right in on the Brad Paisley duet “Goes Without Saying,” a song that would be of a piece on CMT’s Top 20 countdown circa 2003 alongside Alan Jackson, Kenny Chesney, Brooks & Dunn. Same goes for the second Combs collab, “Missin’ You Like This,” and “Devil I’ve Been” with ERNEST, the singer-songwriter currently climbing the charts with his feature on Wallen’s “Cowgirls.” This is pleasant-enough music that asks little of the listener, ideal background noise for your barbecue or tailgate. The patterns of these duets quickly become familiar, and the space Post cedes to his collaborators feels more like a pulled punch than an act of generosity. There’s enough proof here that Post has the voice, demeanor, and goodwill to easily ingratiate himself into the Nashville scene. But what does Post Malone’s version of a country song sound like? The pair of tracks that open F-1 Trillion give an idea. “I got fuck you money/Girl, c’mon and get you some,” Post drawls on “Wrong Ones,” dropping the blue-collar act and joining Tim McGraw for a roots rock ode to meeting iffy women in questionable bars. On “Finer Things,” he recruits Hank Williams Jr. for a portrait of an outlaw in 2024: a dripped-out hellraiser (“Platinum on my teeth, wagyu on my grill”) blasting Skynyrd from his souped-up pontoon. Between these songs emerges a character whose rakish charm is at the center of the Post Malone Venn diagram, connecting the sauced-up rapper, the hedonistic rockstar, the haute hillbilly. You might even call this character the most fully realized version of the artist who denied being a rapper in that 2016 profile—the artist who summed up what he liked about his favorite country artists as such: “They had swag.” Fortune smiles on Post Malone, whose journey from SoundCloud rapper to honky-tonk hero mirrors the arc of the zeitgeist almost exactly. Was it destiny that brought him to the main stage of the country music renaissance, or a cunning 10-year plan? In either case, a listen to the new mgk and Jelly Roll collab, a cringy riff on a John Denver classic, is convincing-enough evidence that a successful crossover takes more than opportunism alone. Watch the way he outshines Wallen in the “I Had Some Help” video, oozing “I’d like to have a beer with that guy” energy. The lane for “biggest name in country” is wide open, if he wants it.",0,"August 20, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/post-malone-f-1-trillion/
Caribou,Honey,7.8,Electronic,"The other day, I was reading in New York Magazine about how “Everything is a kids menu now.” New York’s food editor Alan Sytsma had observed that a lot of newly opened restaurants in the city were “recreating childhood food memories more or less exactly,” citing elevated takes on buttered noodles and McNuggets; given the state of the world, he concluded, “We should probably eat some pudding cake while we have the chance.” The “kids menu” article struck a chord with me, in part because I have a profoundly unrefined palette—I only ate raw fish for the first time a couple of years ago, in large part to save face in front of friends—but mostly because I couldn’t help but apply the same logic to music right now. So much of what comes across my desk seems to offer a gourmet take on something that millennials and Gen X-ers would have loved at some point from childhood to early twenties: Chappell Roan taps into Teenage Dream-era Katy Perry and early Gaga; Phoebe Bridgers and Boygenius superimpose the vocal tone and lyrical directness of pop-punk onto office-friendly folk-rock; Frost Children made an album of shouty ’00s pop, à la Cobra Starship, then one of wintry indie, à la Bright Eyes. Honey, the new album by Caribou, is also ordering from the adult kids’ menu. The dance music milieu with which Dan Snaith tends to be associated has trended this way in recent years: Four Tet remains hard to pin down, thanks to left-field collaborations like last year’s “Darkness, Darkness,” with William Tyler, and the intermittent use of his alias ⣎⡇ꉺლ༽இ•̛)ྀ◞ ༎ຶ ༽ৣৢ؞ৢ؞ؖ ꉺლ, but he’s now best known to many people as the happiest guy ever to headline Coachella, grinning maniacally onstage next to Fred again.. and Skrillex as they drop walloping crowd-pleasers. Floating Points’ latest record, Cascade, is a sharp pivot to extremely danceable dance music after years playing with ambient jazz and modular synthesis. Music with mass appeal—particularly music that harks back to a time in which its intended listener may have been more limber, and had more stamina to stay out dancing till 6 a.m.—remains very big business. With Honey, Snaith shoots his own distinctive style of dance-adjacent music—tracks that sound like they were composed entirely with stuff you could find at a high-end earthenware store—into the cheap seats, toning down the rose-tinted melancholy of 2020’s Suddenly and 2014’s Our Love in favor of tracks that feel rambunctious, bordering on aggressive. The songs on Honey resemble the thrill-seeking dance tracks Snaith usually releases under the alias Daphni, but more in the way you might describe them than in the way they actually sound. The stank-face-inducing womp-womp-womp drop of this album’s title track, for example, is only related to the manic Latin jazz loop of Daphni’s “Always There” in the same way that we all come from the Cradle of Africa. Snaith has not been doing interviews around this record, but a press release says that the impetus for Honey was a desire to make music that’s broadly relatable. These songs, which twirl and dive like gamboling otters, certainly have mainstream appeal: the glorious looping synth arpeggio on “Climbing” chops electro-house and disco into confetti; “Come Find Me” is crisp, euphoric French touch, its searching lyrics appropriately tempering the joy for a few bars towards the song’s end. Imagine I’m saying “mainstream appeal” with the most ardent love and respect. Shifts in purview like this tend to invoke scorn, but I think you’re a liar, or at least profoundly disconnected from your own sense of fun, if you say you’re not moved by hearing a gigantic, eyeball-vibrating drop in an airplane-hangar-sized club. And I can understand why artists like Floating Points and Four Tet, upon seeing the monumental success of festival-headlining dance acts like Fred and Peggy Gou, would want to get in on the fun: If all anyone wants to eat is a spicy tenders combo, why not try your hand at whipping up a Michelin-starred version? Snaith—who, fairly or unfairly, has been accused of baiting Calvin Harris fans since the beat dropped in “Can’t Do Without You”—is very good at dressing up these familiar sounds in finery. Honey is awesome, and it’s also really easy to take down, and it thrives in settings like “Getting dressed for the Charli XCX show” or “Writing a review of Caribou’s new album Honey.” Despite the ease of use, though, there is little mistaking the production credit: “Dear Life” may be unusually forceful in its approach, and “Got to Change” may have the DayGlo positivity of a Fred again.. album closer, but most quintessential Caribou textures, like the ’80s daytime TV gloss of “Over Now,” or the rhythm in “Do Without You” that sounds like it was bashed out on wine glasses, are still firmly in place. Most, because the one quality that previously linked nearly every Caribou song—Snaith’s distinctive, wavering falsetto—is noticeably sidelined on Honey. It pops up here and there on the album’s back half, but for the most part, Snaith’s vocals here are augmented with AI, as if this were a Caribou record featuring a host of anonymous vocalists. On “Broke My Heart” and “Honey,” the two barnstormers that open the record, those vocals are used in the way one would a sample, but on “Come Find Me,” an entire verse is processed as to sound like a cool, slightly warbly young singer, perhaps a Helena Deland or Adrianne Lenker type. Even mentioning this feels like bursting a bubble: Ever since I was told all the vocals on Honey are by Snaith, it’s been hard to hear them as anything other than AI Dan Snaith. It’s blindingly obvious once you know—the phrasing and expression is so clearly him—but I also didn’t clock it until I was told; it felt more like I was hearing verses sampled in their entirety from other songs. I am not particularly freaked out by this development: As mentioned, this album sounds distinctly Caribou, even in all the ways it doesn’t sound like Caribou, and using these techniques likely required more effort than if Snaith had simply performed his vocals as Dan Snaith and bunged them into Ableton. AI is simply another tool that will sometimes be used badly and sometimes be used well, and on Honey I think it’s used well—to complicate and expand the abilities of an artist well into his career, whose creative impulses can no longer be entirely satiated through the means previously available to him. There is one exception: The rap verse on “Campfire” is also Snaith, and it edges toward racial ambiguity in a way that feels queasy. At best, it’s a misguided experiment; at worst, outright minstrelsy. Even if his reasons for doing so are unrelated, declining interviews around this record looks, from the outside, like a way to avoid speaking publicly about this specific aspect of Honey. Given that Snaith is willing to toe the ethical line in this way—an ill-defined line, to be clear, since there still isn’t a generally accepted public view of how AI and art should interact—it might at least be clarifying to hear him explain his process. Has my ill feeling about this one particular moment on Honey tempered my overall experience of the album, or stopped me from returning to it? Honestly, no—as with Snaith’s previous records, the primary joys of this album come in musical form: the way “Climbing” does just as its title suggests, increasing in volume and density and pressure until it threatens to burst like a shaken Coke can; the aforementioned bassline in “Honey,” which pushes past the limits of good taste into a zone of pure enjoyment. Those who initially gravitated towards Caribou’s music for its supposedly intellectual take on peak-time dance music may be disappointed by these simple pleasures—but, then again, there’s still plenty to think about on Honey, just not where you might expect.

Lupe Fiasco,Samurai,7.4,Rap,"Toward the end of The Last Samurai, Helen DeWitt’s 2000 novel about a single mother and son bouncing around the poverty line as the latter searches for a suitable father figure, that son has a conversation with a brilliant but difficult pianist. “Why don’t you make a CD?” the son asks. The pianist replies: “No one would buy the kind of thing I’d like to put on a CD and I can’t afford to make a CD that no one will buy.” The Last Samurai is hailed by critics and sold well over 100,000 copies. But due to contract math that would make Q-Tip blush, DeWitt ended up owing her publisher money. Before long, the book fell out of print. In the decades since, DeWitt’s fiction has focused on the material lives of artists as they struggle to navigate capitalism and psychological collapse. Once an ascendant pop star and critical darling with a seemingly clean trajectory, Lupe Fiasco has seen his career has grow similarly tangled in the last 15 years. Since the public feud between him and his former label, Atlantic, over his third album, 2011’s Lasers, Lupe has remained nearly A-list by reputation, but with plummeting chart positions that suggest an audience segmented from the rap mainstream. He’s spoken frequently and eloquently about not only the business minutiae that has complicated his decision-making, but the ways hip-hop—and music writ large—is devalued compared to so-called fine art. (“If I want to read the next book by Helen DeWitt, I can just write it, and read it, and then write another one,” the Last Samurai author told The Believer in 2012. “Painters do that and nobody objects.”) Samurai, which arrives almost two years to the day after Lupe’s eighth album, Drill Music in Zion, has plenty in common with that project: It’s produced entirely by longtime collaborator Soundtrakk, skews jazzy and subdued, and is slight (even slighter, in fact, at just 30 minutes). Its title was inspired by a moment in Asif Kapadia’s 2015 Amy Winehouse documentary in which the late singer leaves a voice message for producer Salaam Remi describing herself as a samurai battle rapper. For Lupe, the metaphor seems tidy: a motivated master working in relative isolation, honing a blade. The album is conspicuously breezy. Lupe’s singing voice, a staple of his style as far back as The Cool, has only grown more pliable: See the way he moves between cadences and harmonies on the hook and verses of “Palaces,” each smartly shaped and carefully rendered. Elsewhere he flits, without apparent effort, between other modes of technical wizardry, like the staccato syllable latticework that dresses up pedestrian writing on the second verse of “No. 1 Headband” or the passage on “Mumble Rap” that begins with the line, “With a style similar to riding around looking for an arrest to resist.” It feels as if there’s some great, centrifugal force pushing down on the middle of each bar. And yet this musical ease seems at deliberate odds with the torture Lupe describes, in first- and third-person, of trying to hack a career in the arts. There are the shows where the “front row the only row” (“Bigfoot”); there is the line on “Outside” where he says, “My business bone is connected to my ethics”—defiant from one angle, quixotic from another. Lupe lapses in and out of Amy Winehouse portraiture, and when he raps, on closer “Til Eternity,” about a beehive that “survived in a wreck,” it’s both a reference to her signature hairstyle and a metaphor that echos the ones he introduces earlier on the album. “We think we’re fortresses, made of stone,” he croons on “Palaces,” “but we’re just palaces made out of flesh and bone.” Despite the loftiness of “palace,” he presents this fragility without romance—or at least, with full knowledge of the forces conspiring to puncture it at every pass.

Six Organs of Admittance,Time Is Glass,7.7,Experimental,"As with all Greek myths, there are several contradictory versions of the story of Hephaestus, but in each one, he was exiled from paradise and forced to toil at his craft on the Earth before he could go home, transformed into an artisan god. I’m sure Ben Chasny wasn’t making such lofty claims when he gave Hephaestus’ name to a song on his new album, but the parallels are plain. Back when Six Organs of Admittance was a few years old and still fairly divisible by Leo Kottke and the No-Neck Blues Band, Chasny left Northern California as a stern fingerstyle guitarist with penchants for Asian modes, lo-fi noise, and occult antiquity. After 20 years of roaming, he returned to Humboldt as a more tempered songwriter and a superior sound artist of capacious scope. Alone, he drew the ancient redwoods around him like a curtain and set to work on Time Is Glass. Rather than adding new experiments to those spread across his dozens of releases, he resumed them, using all the powers he’d banked, from the special vantage of where it all began. “Hephaestus” is just the latest time that Chasny has set an instrumental on Greek marble—he memorably put Actaeon, who was turned into a stag and eaten by his dogs for glimpsing Artemis bathing, in the first song on Luminous Night—and it’s probably the best. On Time Is Glass, the song is a dramatic outlier: a musky, supple, soul-shivering drone piece that credibly evokes sparks peeling from a divinely immense anvil. But this is what passes for a back-to-basics Americana record in Chasny’s expandable world, and most of the songs sink deep acoustic roots before growing in gratifying ways, whether subtle or surprising. The bookends, “The Mission” and “New Year’s Song,” lay out his songwriting materials in their sparest pieces—the room tone chirring like cicadas, your ear right up against the hole in the guitar, and a thin, sweet, slightly aloof voice floating down from somewhere above. Replicating them four or five more times with some atmospheric interludes would have made for a fine record. But Chasny has never been content with fine, and with his unusual blend of restlessness and focus, he keeps breaking new connecting paths between leafy, well-worn ways. This exploration unfolds with intense patience, each song striking out a little further. An electric guitar glints like light through the clouds in “Slip Away” before “Theophany Song” reminds us exactly why Chasny was once so associated with Devendra Banhart, and then the forge heats up for a spectacular second half. “My Familiar” is a haunting dirge until an electric guitar appears, the muted riffs and sailing leads structured tightly as a proof. It continues the uncanny chimera of Steve Stevens and Bill Frisell solos that Chasny concocted on his last album, The Veiled Sea. “Summer’s Last Rays” seems like a pure technical showcase of fanning runs, leaps, and trills until an invasive species of reversed, gurgling effects starts tugging at the relentless figures, refuting their rigid account of linear time. The two and a half minutes of wistful acoustic sprays that open “Spinning in a River” set up a drop so good, so unguessable yet fitting, that I genuinely don’t want to spoil it. Lyrically as well as musically, Chasny accretes meaning in thin layers of glaze. His words don’t look like much on the page but drench the music with emotional color. It would be unseemly for any one line to stand out too much; everything he makes is shaped to its purpose, without extra parts or redundant functions. After 25 years of Six Organs, you almost have to wonder what deal he made with the gods to keep him from either settling into a rut or taking ill-considered detours. Being so well established, he could easily spend a few years here and there just strolling through his richly timbered guitar playing. But he hasn’t. You still never know from one song what might appear on the next, or even where the song you’re listening to might go, and it keeps the music fresh even when it’s retreading hallowed ground.

Pearl Jam,Dark Matter,6.4,Rock,"When a veteran artist turns to a young-gun producer for a shot of contemporary savvy, it usually signals a desire to revamp their sound or embrace a new era. Sometimes it works: Jack White brought some bluesy grit to Loretta Lynn’s Van Lear Rose; St. Vincent nudged Sleater-Kinney in a sleeker, icier direction. And sometimes it doesn’t; remember when Danger Mouse tried to steer RHCP into an album of lush space-funk? But generally, at least, a spirit of reinvention animates the proceedings. Pearl Jam, though, seem to have hired Andrew Watt to help them sound more like… Pearl Jam. The 33-year-old producer, who was born a few months before Ten was recorded, made a name working with Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber but has since become a sought-after studio whisperer for rock elders, slickening up recent Rolling Stones and Iggy Pop albums without embarrassing his heroes. He even produced Eddie Vedder’s last solo album. With Pearl Jam, Watt seems to have served more like an accountability manager. “He really kicked our asses, got us focused and playing, song after song,” guitarist Mike McCready told an interviewer, emphasizing the album’s heaviness; Vedder told fans he believes “this is our best work.” Alluring testimonials, but the reality is less dramatic. Dark Matter plays like another solid late-era Pearl Jam record, reliable but not revelatory, with the requisite well-honed mix of generic fist-pumpers, roiling ballads, and mid-tempo gems where Vedder gets a chance to howl and yearn and babble in the upper registers as only Vedder can. As ever, he evokes a potent balance of pain and perseverance, but the album is marred by boilerplate rockers that try to confront fascist dread with platitudes and banal expressions of resistance. The title track, in particular, makes for an uninspiring lead single. A grinding, metallic rocker that’s sophomoric in its simplicity, it feels indistinguishable from the band’s legions of corporate-rock imitators. Vedder’s railing against right-wingers and press suppression seems well-intentioned: “No tolerance for intolerance or/No patience left for impatience no more” is a nice sentiment, but doesn’t exactly hit with the same provocative thrill as “I’ll never suck Satan’s dick!” The punk quickie “Running,” a fast blur of sewage metaphors and Guitar Center-core power chords, isn’t much better, while “React, Respond” thrashes and shakes like a Vs. outtake with the eccentricity sucked out. Again, Vedder is animated by righteous rage, but a frustrating vagueness dogs the lyrics, as though he’s speechwriting for a DNC keynote: “The light gets brighter/As it grows/The darkness it recedes,” he sings in “React, Respond.” It’s hard to imagine anyone but the most devoted heads differentiating these songs from deep cuts on, say, Backspacer. They’re “heavy,” sure, but not in the way that leaves a real impression. The promotional emphasis on these high-octane rockers seems baffling, because the heart of Dark Matter—the songs that remind you what made this band so special in the first place—are the slow-burners. The searching, six-minute “Upper Hand,” in particular, is a centerpiece. After a long, ringing fade-in reminiscent of Joshua Tree-era U2, it blossoms into a bluesy cousin of “Yellow Ledbetter,” and a launchpad for some of McCready’s most soulful soloing to date. It surely ranks among the best Pearl Jam songs this century. “Wreckage” is both world-weary and hopeful, the kind of generous midtempo ballad that could belong to any era of the band’s discography. Its layered tapestry of backing vocals delivers a climax worthy of the arenas they’ll play this summer. Then there’s “Waiting for Stevie,” which originated when Vedder and Watt were idly waiting for Stevie Wonder to show up and record a part for Vedder’s last solo album. Despite the red herring title (the lyrics seem to be about depression and self-doubt, not Stevie Wonder), the song is a meaty, anthemic rocker of the kind the band has largely shied away from this side of Y2K. It has already become a favorite in the PJ fan community, though its tinny, compressed production gives it an unpleasant sheen and suggests that live versions will be superior. As Dark Matter draws to a close, survival seems heavy on Vedder’s mind. “I’ll be the last one standing,” he sings on “Got to Give,” a Who-like bundle of ringing power chords where the singer sounds more and more like Roger Daltrey the higher the song builds. “Am I the only one hanging on?” he wonders on the somber closer, “Setting Sun,” an elegy seemingly for a departed friend. Who can blame him? At 59, the man has outlived a shocking number of his grunge contemporaries. It’s been two decades since Vedder eulogized Layne Staley on “4/20/02,” three since he destroyed his hotel room after learning Kurt Cobain was dead, and still, seemingly every time Pearl Jam returns with a new album, another grunge icon (most recently: Mark Lanegan) has suffered an untimely demise. This band’s longevity is a wonder. They are unwitting standard-bearers for a long-passed movement. Their inessential albums feel like luxuries in a reality where their peers never got to make an inessential album. On this one, they fall short of reinvention, which also means they are still—improbably, unmistakably—Pearl Jam. If Dark Matter has an overarching theme, it’s the search for hope and perseverance in a shattered world—and that’s a world where the existence of any new Pearl Jam album, even an uneven one, is a small miracle.

Johnny Cash,Songwriter,6.5,Folk/Country,"When Johnny Cash teamed up with Rick Rubin for 1994’s American Recordings, their partnership launched one of the great final acts in 20th-century American music. Yet such a comeback would have seemed vanishingly unlikely at the dawn of the ’90s. Left without a major label for the first time since 1958, Cash had resigned himself to the ignominious depths of Branson, Missouri, the Ozark town known for tacky theaters housing fading stars from yesteryear. The country icon couldn’t even get that right. His financial backing went belly up prior to the launch of the Johnny Cash Theatre in the summer of 1992. When he did finally play the venue a year later, he was stuck filling in for its new headline attraction: the notorious lounge lizard Wayne Newton. The previously unheard demos on Songwriter, a posthumous new album, shed light on that comeback, a narrative so immutable that it today seems etched in stone. They’re drawn from sessions at Nashville’s LSI Studios, where Cash set up at some point in the early ’90s to record a clutch of newly written songs. John Carter Cash—the only child of Johnny and June Carter Cash—recently discovered the recordings, but the artist’s intentions for them remain unclear. Cash’s decision to record at LSI may have been partially altruistic, as it was the joint property of his stepdaughter Rosie and her then-husband Mike Daniel, and thus an easy way to funnel some funds their way. It’s also possible that the demos were meant to persuade another label to sign the country veteran—a goal that was met by other means once Cash met Rubin in 1993. Two of the tunes on Songwriter, “Drive On” and “Like a Soldier,” also appear on American Recordings, and their simultaneous presence illuminates the distance between the two projects. They’re two of the lighter moments on the spare, stoic American Recordings and two of the weightier songs on Songwriter, a record that finds plenty of room for Cash’s humor and sentimentality, character traits Rubin staunchly avoided. The two qualities combine on “I Love You Tonite,” a love letter to June Carter Cash in which he marvels that they’ve made it through the decades and wonders if they’ll last until the new millennium. Some big concerns nag at Cash—he ponders the fate of the planet on “Hello Out There”—yet he generally spends Songwriter operating at a smaller scale, penning character sketches of single mothers sustained by their love of James Taylor, flirting with a woman at the laundromat (“Well Alright”), and writing an ode to all the pretty girls from Little Rock. There’s no sense of foreboding here; it’s as light and rambling as any of the LPs he cut during his waning days at Columbia in the early 1980s or the unjustly maligned Mercury platters from later that decade. Songwriter distinguishes itself through its posthumous production. Working with longtime engineer David Ferguson, John Carter Cash labored to break these dated LSI demos away from their origins, stripping down the recordings—and adding new parts from players like Vince Gill and Dan Auerbach—so they feature little more than voice, a little guitar, and, in two cases, harmony vocals from Waylon Jennings. The presence of his fellow Highwayman illustrates that these original LSI recordings were no solitary affair. At least 10 session players are thanked in the liner notes, including Marty Stuart, who was among the many musicians enlisted by Carter Cash and Ferguson to transform the tapes into a record that feels closer to American Recordings than Boom Chicka Boom, to name one of those final Mercury records. Their work is so nuanced and sympathetic to Cash’s idiosyncrasies that Gill’s vocal harmonies on “Poor Valley Girl” and Auerbach’s guitar on the after-hours blues “Spotlight” barely register: The focus remains solely on Cash. That John Carter Cash and David Ferguson succeed in freeing these tunes from their period trappings, creating a record that’s conceivably a cousin to the sepia-toned traditionalism of American Recordings, is no small feat. It can be difficult to hear Cash’s charms through the bright, digital clang that plagues his ’80s recordings. The refurbished warmth of Songwriter makes it easier to concentrate on the clever turns of phrase and solid construction of these excavated tunes. As pleasurable as they are—and they’re quite endearing, particularly for listeners who enjoy the silly and tender sides of the Man in Black—it’s also clear that if they’d been released as an album in 1993, these songs wouldn’t have altered the course of Cash’s career the way American Recordings did. That album demonstrated a real understanding of Cash’s mythos; Songwriter is mostly a testament to the sturdiness of his craft.

Doechii,Alligator Bites Never Heal,7.0,Rap / Pop/R&B,"Four tracks into her new mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal, Doechii is gasping for air. Don’t get it twisted: The 26-year-old rapper isn’t short on lung power. But after five years in the music industry—a period in which she signed to Kendrick Lamar’s former label Top Dawg Entertainment, earned a coveted spot in the 2022 XXL Freshman Class, and charted a platinum single with the R&B-focused “What It Is (Block Boy)”—Doechii yearned for the kind of breather that up-and-comers typically aren’t advised to take. In the final bars of “Denial Is a River,” a candid conversation with a therapist alter ego, Doechii illustrates the consequences of life in the fast lane: Her therapist suggests a breathing exercise, and Doechii hyperventilates rhythmically, flailing in the space between a scribble scratch and a panic attack. Alligator Bites Never Heal fits Doechii like an oxygen mask. On her most ambitious and musically diverse project to date—19 tracks that feel more sensitive and self-possessed than her recent spate of club-ready singles—she makes room for vulnerability. It’s a formidable full-length debut, fluid yet focused, that reprises her playful and melodic sides without skimping on hard-hitting hip-hop. Doechii splashed onto the scene with the 2020 EP Oh the Places You’ll Go, a seven-song collection more or less defined by the cutesy viral hit “Yucky Blucky Fruitcake.” she / her / black bitch, her 2022 debut EP for TDE, marked a definitive turn away from the bubbly aesthetic; on subsequent singles, Doechii pushed into harder and faster territory, embracing Rico Nasty’s punk sensibilities on “Pacer” and experimenting with house music on “Alter Ego.” She’s a capable chameleon, but the searching specificity of her early tracks has been MIA. As Doechii put it on recent single “MPH”: “I could give them the conscious shit, but I’m too busy giving them cunt.” Alligator Bites Never Heal is all about processing not posturing. Doechii raps with sober-minded confidence, acknowledging “lost friends, shed just like loose skin” and the pressures of label expectations and impostor syndrome. On opening track “Stanka Pooh,” she cycles through intrusive thoughts: “What if I choke on this Slurpee? What if I make it big? What if my car exploded while I’m casually pumping the gas and smoking a cig?” Just when it’s getting serious, she tempers the weight with a cutting couplet: “And if those the only fears that I’ll take to my grave/I’m pissing on you hoes living or dead.” That’s Doechii at her nuanced best—anxious, funny, pissing on hoes. Doechii hails from Tampa, and the mixtape’s swampier sounds drip with humidity, including the thrumming “Bullfrog” and the chopped-and-screwed intro to “Skipp.” Heat takes over on “Nissan Altima,” a standout filled with flavor and filth (if you didn’t know Doechii is bisexual, you’ll find out when she says, “She munchin’ on the box while she watchin’ Hulu”). The raunchy bravado is only temporary, offset by moments of intimacy: On “Bloom,” Doechii’s prayer of self-love resonates through layered harmonies akin to Madison McFerrin. The mellow, sparkling groove of “Beverly Hills” makes an unexpected match for Doechii’s melodic potential. If there’s any real issue with this mixtape, it’s the way several less cerebral tracks cluster together in the final third, creating a dense patch of more lyrically superficial songs. But Doechii never said she’d put pop to bed. More than once on Alligator Bites, she suggests that TDE is skeptical of her swerve into alternative R&B. “I just can’t sang a little bit? I mean that shit was a hit!” she complains on the cleverly satirical “Boom Bap,” protesting her confinement to rap in a slurry of syllables. Alligator Bites makes Doechii’s stance clear: Nobody puts Doechii in a corner. But if this is the sound of Doechii pushing against constraints, a little friction might not be the worst thing.",0,"September 5, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/doechii-alligator-bites-never-heal/
Ice Cube,AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted,9.0,Rap,"Ronald Reagan knew television. Broadcasting since the birth of the medium, he always understood exactly how he looked on the other side of the camera. He used TV to cast himself as a kindly septuagenarian who loved jelly beans and playing cowboy, while his aides prepped him not with foreign policy debriefings but by telling him what to do in a particular “scene.” His major political battles were waged by the combined force of law and the mass media against enemies foreign (the Soviet Union) and domestic (the poor, especially Black). Throughout the decade, a credulous, ratings-hungry TV news media used Reagan’s “law and order” style of right-wing governance to cast young Black men as the nation’s primary criminal menace, known mainly by their Action News poses, described by Ice Cube on “Rollin’ Wit the Lench Mob”: “On my knees in the street /Interlock my hands and feet.” Los Angeles made a great staging ground for Reagan’s so-called war on drugs, and in 1989 the hardline, media-savvy LAPD Chief Daryl Gates invited Nancy Reagan (and a phalanx of TV reporters) to observe a staged raid on a suspected dealer. “The working press arrived to find Mrs. Reagan and Gates munching fruit salad in an air-conditioned motor home parked beside the alleged rock house,” reported the L.A. Times. By the early 1980s, television had replaced the daily newspaper as the nation’s primary news medium. Increasingly, the cultural relevance or accepted truth of an event was only fully acknowledged once video surfaced on the nightly news, or an evening TV drama ripped the story from the headlines. TV’s unique capacity to absorb, juxtapose, and regurgitate current events through pre-existing genres and cutting-edge visuals would soon come to be characterized as “postmodern,” but a more useful term came from critic Todd Gitlin, who described ’80s TV programming as the ultimate “recombinant” platform. Writing in 1983 of TV shows and films mimicking the increasingly torrid pace of Reagan’s unregulated late-capitalist consumerism, Gitlin explained that “in a world stripped of transcendent unities, the strategy of collage, of juxtaposition, makes the best of a bad situation,” in which “order can be assembled only from the juxtaposition of shards.” Pop music had been juxtaposing shards into new forms for decades by this point, and no form was doing so more virtuosically than hip-hop, whether via DJs looping rhythmic breaks or rappers adopting outlandish personae and shuffling through pop culture references. As hip-hop became more political, rappers started mimicking the news reporters who were constantly prowling around their neighborhoods. In 1982, Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s “The Message” opened with Melle Mel braying a tabloid headline about the shards he saw all around him: “Broken glass, everywhere!” A year later, Run-D.M.C. debuted with their own form of recombinant street journalism by flipping Walter Cronkite’s epochal and confident CBS Evening News signoff—“And that’s the way it is”—to a mordant slogan for young Black no-hopers at the dawn of Reaganism: “It’s like that/And that’s the way it is.” A few years later, Public Enemy frontman Chuck D—who was born in 1960 and came of age during the peaks of Black Power and 1970s Black television—took the metaphor to its logical conclusion, telling Spin that “rap is Black America’s TV station,” a medium that “gives a whole perspective of what exists and what Black life is about.” Ten years Chuck’s junior and perhaps his most prominent admirer, Ice Cube also came of age in front of the tube, and thought of his creative process via televisual metaphor. In a 1990 interview for the rap TV show Pump It Up, Cube pointed at his temples and told host Dee Barnes, “This is my VCR. I just like, go through the streets and live, and kinda observe.” Fittingly, the interview coincided with the release of Cube’s debut solo album AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted, the title a timely riff on Fox television’s groundbreaking “reality” television program. America’s Most Wanted was itself very recombinant: host John Walsh addressed viewers from a set that merged the imagery of a TV police station, news studio, and charity telethon, introducing flashy, dramatic re-enactments of violent crimes for which the fugitives were still at large, then prompting viewers to call a 1-800 number with tips. Walsh himself had taken a unique path to fame: after the abduction and murder of his son, he became a national advocate for child safety, and was himself portrayed on TV by Hill Street Blues star Daniel J. Travanti in the blockbuster 1983 made-for-TV movie Adam. With America’s Most Wanted, John Walsh repackaged his family’s trauma into the character of a mercenary news anchor: Cronkite with a dash of Dirty Harry. On “AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted,” Ice Cube also plays an entertainingly inflated version of himself: an intelligent, cocky, and preternaturally media-savvy Black 20-year-old from South Central, who just so happened to have spent the previous summer with his previous group, N.W.A., being surveilled and harassed by cops across the midwest for the crime of writing and threatening to perform a song called “Fuck Tha Police.” But apart from a quick “FBI on my dick, stay off!” in the third verse, Cube elides the previous year’s drama on the title track (he also saved his epochal N.W.A. diss for his next album). Instead, he casts himself as a fugitive from America’s Most Wanted’s armchair vigilantes, holing up in the hood after a profitable and fully armed “trip to the suburbs” a few weeks earlier. When he sees his face on television, he tries to make a quick escape, but has already been snitched on by a woman down the street watching the broadcast, and is immediately loaded into the back of a police cruiser. The lesson? The police will ignore him for robbing his “own kind,” but the second his character moves into white neighborhoods, he’s got a target on his back. Cube’s larger point should sound familiar: Sister Souljah made it after the 1992 Los Angeles uprising and became a national pariah. It’s the same justification for why, apart from the police, pop radio was Cube’s biggest enemy, such that he devoted an entire AmeriKKKa track to assailing radio programmers’ fear of alienating advertisers with “real” Black music. A couple decades earlier, it was the same idea that kept the books, films, and recordings of some of Cube’s forerunners and inspirations—The Last Poets, Gil Scott-Heron, Rudy Ray Moore, Donald Goines, Melvin Van Peebles, Iceberg Slim—limited to Black bookstores, record shops, and nightclubs; and inspired J. Edgar Hoover to label the media-savvy armed revolutionaries the Black Panther Party as the “greatest threat to the internal security of the United States.” Less than 25 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Cube and a new crop of vociferous young Black men were actively trolling “the color line”—a phrase popularized by W.E.B. DuBois in The Souls of Black Folk that still dominated U.S. race relations. But at the dawn of the 1990s, it was clear that the latest front in the long-running war for Black American self-determination would be waged as a mass-media spectacle, attempting to counteract a vast new culture war. The struggle against a supposed coarsening of popular culture, led by far-right conservatives, evangelical Christian groups, and ad-hoc organizations like Tipper Gore’s PMRC, quickly filled the significant political gap left by the waning Soviet Cold War. Democratic congressman Sidney Yates explained it succinctly in a 1990 interview: “You’ve got a fight going on today that is just as emotional as the fight that took place (in the 1950s). Except communism isn’t the bogeyman. This time it’s pornography and obscenity.” Predictably, rappers would soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a media spectacle with dire political stakes. Hip-hop’s ascendant political revolution would be televised, and not only via Cube licking shots at Soul Train and Arsenio Hall on AmeriKKKa, Public Enemy sending-up of B.E.T.’s news programming on “Night of the Living Baseheads,” or Ice-T squaring off with Tipper Gore on Oprah. After teaming up with P.E.’s production team the Bomb Squad, Cube and his producer Sir Jinx used the newly released digital sampler to mimic cable TV’s depthless channel-flipping phantasmagoria, stirring L.A. electro-funk, a bleak sense of humor, and plenty of TV clips into a fun-house mirror of It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back’s ceaseless barrage of Malcolm X and James Brown soundbites. Taking additional cues from De La Soul’s skit-heavy, TV-poisoned masterpiece 3 Feet High and Rising and 3rd Bass’ sampledelic The Cactus Album, AmeriKKKa is what critic David Toop called “television structured music, influenced as much by tabloid news dramatizations as by the fragmentation of TV narrative by over-frequent commercial breaks.” Cube, Jinx, and the Bomb Squad were deploying Reagan’s preferred cultural weapon against the world he bequeathed them. At the end of the skit that opens AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted, during which Ice Cube is executed by electric chair, a man’s voice weaves its way into the soundscape: “Was America willing to maintain order, no matter what the cost?” The voice belongs to civil rights icon Julian Bond, narrating the landmark PBS civil rights documentary Eyes on the Prize about the heated late-1960s moment after the FBI had assassinated Black Panther Fred Hampton and police had opened fire on protesters at Attica prison. For Ice Cube, the answer to Bond’s question was an unqualified “yes”: The nation’s very existence was predicated on, at the very least, shutting people like Ice Cube up. But then the sample leads into “The N***a Ya Love To Hate.” Not only would he not shut up, but Cube fought back as the first major rapper to create a brand out of the language’s most notorious slur. It started as trolling—Cube’s erstwhile collaborator MC Ren loved baiting white journalists into awkwardly saying it aloud during interviews. The word had been intellectually and politically reclaimed via the fire-and-brimstone soul of Curtis Mayfield, the incisive comedy and commentary of Richard Pryor and Dick Gregory, and the minimalist poetry of hip-hop’s politically minded originators. At the time, Cube would occasionally don a black ballcap with that word emblazoned on it. On AmeriKKKa’s single “Who’s the Mack?”, he clarifies that in lieu of the wide-brimmed hats and loud suits of hip-hop’s emergent pimp contingent, he’s “just a straight up N-I-double-G-A.” The music video for “Who’s the Mack?” was where Cube first demonstrated his gift for cleverly assessing and satirizing Black pop culture. In the clip (directed by Alex Winter of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure), Cube positions himself as a different kind of “street reporter” than he was on “Fuck Tha Police” or “Straight Outta Compton.” Here, he addresses the camera like a TV newsmagazine host while DJ Pooh dramatizes different versions of young Black men trying to get over in the modern world: an abusive pimp throwing sex workers into the trunk of his car, a conniving “squeegee man” bugging motorists for change, and a sleazy ladies’ man talking about his hot tub to women at the club. To Cube, they’re all playing the same con game. Light years from Max Julien’s Goldie character, Cube democratized macking: At the end of the video, President Bush is “President Mack,” disgraced televangelist Jim Bakker is a “Busted Mack,” and over-leveraged Manhattan real-estate developer and soon-to-be-divorced tabloid icon Donald Trump is a “Broke Mack.” The “Mack” track clearly demonstrated the possibilities of the Bomb Squad and Cube/Jinx’s creative and comedic mind-meld, weaving a period-appropriate sample from Marvin Gaye’s Trouble Man soundtrack with Shock G’s winking pimp caricature from the previous year’s pop crossover “The Humpty Dance.” When Cube and Jinx showed up in New York to record, P.E.’s production team sent them to scour a Long Island warehouse basement packed with records to find the samples they wanted to use. “With (the) Bomb Squad it was like, ‘We can’t go to the real studio until we fill these two crates up with records that you like,’” Cube recalled. A couple years before Dr. Dre re-cast P-Funk as G-Funk, “You Can’t Fade Me” flipped the smooth hook from “Rumpofsteelskin,” the Chuck D collaboration “Endangered Species (Tales From the Darkside)” used George Clinton’s “Bop Gun” scream, and “The Ni**a Ya Love To Hate” borrowed “Atomic Dog”s electro-thwack. AmeriKKKa’s production wasn’t nearly as earth-shatteringly great as the Bomb Squad’s on Fear of a Black Planet—the highest possible bar to clear, to be fair. In fact, the album’s best production moment comes on the all-too-brief dice-game drama “What They Hittin’ Foe?”, which sounds closest to what the Dust Brothers had just cooked up for Paul’s Boutique. During production, Chuck D acted as something of an older brother to Cube. “You don’t gotta become conscious overnight, but you also have to grow,” Chuck said. Though AmeriKKKa was far from the political call-to-action Cube would shape for 1991’s Death Certificate, “Endangered Species”—the subtitle of which was cleverly flipped from the era’s creepiest syndicated TV horror show—laid out his politics clearly. After a news anchor frames the track like an investigative TV news report, Cube dismisses calls to ally with African freedom movements while describing Black Los Angeles as America’s own Bantustan, crawling with racist cops whose primary concern is adding to their personal body count of murdered Black youth. Cube raps it in an angry bark that was becoming his trademark sound. Where Chuck’s booming delivery channels Black oratory through Marv Albert, Cube in high dudgeon raps like a bully taunting you to your face, through a megaphone. Off-record, Cube was dating a woman whom he’d marry in 1992 (and is still with). On wax, however, women were targeted as much as “the police, the media, and suckers that went pop,” never more than via the selfish asshole who narrates “You Can’t Fade Me.” An R-rated Maury episode a few years before the fact, the track cycles through numerous imagined and violent scenarios to avoid responsibility for a child: “Then I thought deep about giving up the money/What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy.” When critic Greg Tate asked Cube to explain that line, Cube replied, “Everybody has fantasies,” aligning the perspective with someone who imagines robbing a bank while waiting for a teller. (“You Can’t Fade Me” was actually quite tame compared to the Geto Boys’ gruesome 1990 track “Mind of a Lunatic,” on which the trio imagined themselves as the most sadistic, murderous villains imaginable.) On “It’s a Man’s World,” Cube’s protégé Yo-Yo plays the straight woman to Cube’s outsize sexist buffoon, but as a battle of the sexes, it’s not a fair fight. This is Cube’s world, and within it, women are required to contort to the vulgar imagination of a 20-year-old with plenty of emotional growing to do, but who still always gives himself the last word. But at the same time, “You Can’t Fade Me” offers insight into Cube’s greatest gift: storytelling. It’s a macabre view into the mind of a young man with fucked-up priorities, but Cube lays it out with the condensed detail of Slick Rick or Ice-T. Cube’s preternatural skill at evoking the Black suburban experience that served as the mundane background to his gangsta fantasies is still somehow underappreciated, and “Once Upon a Time In the Projects” displays the youthful, creative demeanor that would produce Friday five years later. As the story opens, Cube’s in the family living room of a young woman he’s hoping to hook up with—naturally, the suburban chaos reminds him of Good Times and Robin Harris’ standup routine “Bebe’s kids.” But like an amateur version of a Richard Pryor bit, the scene quickly grows bizarre when, at the end of the first verse, Cube realizes he’s sitting in the front room of a crackhouse. When the cops show up, they misinterpret the word “dope” on his t-shirt and toss him and the girl into a police cruiser. Of course, there’s a moral: “Now the story you heard has one little object/Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects.” On the surface, Cube’s politics on AmeriKKKa would appear to be a simple reactivation of the Panthers’ media-savvy push for Black liberation in the shadow of Reaganism, but clues to a deeper conservatism are everywhere. Not just in his consistently articulated belief that women were nothing more than sex objects to be used and discarded, but also in “Who’s the Mack?” when he instantly assumes that Black people asking for spare change are up to something sinister, or in “Projects,” when he says the woman’s gang-affiliated younger brother “needs to pull his pants up.” It wasn’t a Bill Cosby-style integrationist conservatism that Cube aspired toward, but, as a 1990 Rolling Stone interview revealed, the worldview articulated by Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam—whom the reporter observed Cube watching with interest on an episode of The Phil Donahue Show. Over the prior decade, Farrakhan had dragged the Nation of Islam from near-irrelevance onto television and into hip-hop lyrics, selling out Madison Square Garden with an ideology rooted in economic and social separatism. The “projects,” for Cube and Farrakhan, weren’t the symbolic origin of future Black success like they’d soon be for Nas and Jay-Z, but an embarrassment to the Black community that, importantly, it was up to the Black community itself to fix. Cube would explore his unique approach to Farrakhanism in depth on the double album Death Certificate, but that was still a year away. In 1990, Cube and AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted served as a bombastic introduction to what would later be dubbed “the tabloid decade,” a merger of Reaganist law and order and TV’s shift to lurid infotainment drawn from the supermarket checkout line—otherwise known as the first wave of “reality” entertainment. Specific to hip-hop, it was AmeriKKKa as much as Nation of Millions and Straight Outta Compton that laid the groundwork for hip-hop’s brief and dramatic evolution into an expansive truth-telling media spectacle.",0,"June 9, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ice-cube-amerikkkas-most-wanted/
Fontaines D.C.,Romance,7.7,Rock,"On Fontaines D.C.’s panic-attack-inspired 2024 single “Starburster,” frontman Grian Chatten searches desperately for unfiltered certainty. “I wanna take the truth without a lens on it/My god-given insanity depends on it,” he sings, buried amid crunchy boom-bap beats and wheezing Mellotron. The song’s cryptic video—and its ominous parade of gimp masks, albuterol hits, and reconstructive surgery—only underscores the sense that the Irish group, once famous for its studied cool, might be going off the rails. Where Fontaines D.C.’s 2022 album Skinty Fia bid a tenebrous farewell to the band’s Dublin origins, on Romance they embrace their transformation into globe-trotting rock stars. Having evolved from the pints, poetry, and working-class grit of their roots, they’ve traded longtime collaborator Dan Carey (Squid, Black Midi) for producer James Ford, known for his work with arena-scale bands like Arctic Monkeys, Gorillaz, and Depeche Mode; they’ve replaced the raw post-punk of Dogrel and A Hero’s Death with a Frankenstein assemblage of Britpop, gothic Americana, and ’90s alt rock. (They’ve updated their outfits, too, with new looks that suggest Harmony Korine styling the Spice Girls.) Are they having an identity crisis, or playing with their newfound fame? Excitingly, it’s a bit of both. Romance maintains the darkness integral to Fontaines D.C.’s music while showcasing a frisky unpredictability. Romance opens with a feeling of limitless possibility framed against a backdrop of impending doom. The ominous title track feels like a death march: Its piano melody teeters between innocence and occult, accompanied by brooding fuzz guitar and percussion that sounds like it was recorded in a damp cave. “Maybe romance is a place,” Chatten sings seductively: “For me/And you.” What follows is similarly sprawling and surrealistic, combining the Cure’s haunting sweetness with the Pixies’ nightmarish edge. Opulent string arrangements conjure the ghosts of classic cinema, then give way to a darkly Western influence. Chatten sounds more vibrant than ever, exuding the starry-eyed curiosity of a traveler exploring a new city. From his jittery breathing and soulful crooning on “Starburster” to the urgent falsetto and seductive sighs of “Here’s the Thing” to a weepy head voice on “Desire,” his newfound range is remarkable, and so is the band’s. On “In the Modern World,” they channel the dreamy tones of Lana Del Rey’s “Sad Girl” and the Smashing Pumpkins’ “Tonight, Tonight.” On “Death Kink,” Chatten’s voice shifts between narcotized and menacing as he unspools lyrics like a round of exquisite corpse: “I live meretricious/You shattered/Amazing stars from the drink.” Yet for all the music’s supersized passion, Fontaines D.C. are in an emotional headlock on Romance. “To be anesthetized/And crave emotion,” Chatten pleads on “Here’s the Thing.” Numbness is seductive (“In the Modern World”) and sentimentality is a sickness that leads to fatal consequences (“Motorcycle Boy”). The journey culminates with the jangle-pop gem “Favourite,” which Chatten has described as sounding paradoxically like death to him. “I don’t mean that in a negative sense,” he clarified. “It sounds like surrendering to the flow.” The tender “Horseness Is the Whatness”—which quotes one of their original heroes, James Joyce—is Romance’s breakthrough, and the most beautiful song in the band’s catalog to date. The ultrasound heartbeat of Carlos O’Connell’s daughter merges with lush strings into a sprawling slow burn. “Will someone/Find out what the word is/That makes the world go round?” pleads Chatten, singing lyrics written by O’Connell. “’Cause I thought it was love/But some say that it has to be choice.” A world away from the antic wordplay of “Starburster” or the inflamed bruise of “Here’s the Thing,” “Horseness Is the Whatness” embraces the quest for meaning amid the whirlwind of new life. Tom Coll’s percussion sounds like slow-motion explosions, while the fluttering strings add to the wistful, tense atmosphere. They haven’t thrown away all their initial inspirations, but—just like the garish green tracksuits and Y2K dye jobs—they have found exciting new ways to style them. The brilliance of Romance lies in its unsettling blend of antic energy with refined craft—in the depths of detachment, Fontaines D.C. strike an engaging pose.

Terry Riley,Descending Moonshine Dervishes,8.1,Experimental,"Terry Riley wanted to disrupt the flow of time. The budding composer had spent a few years experimenting with tape loops and Echoplex delay units back in the Bay Area, where he was part of the San Francisco Tape Music Center alongside fellow mavericks Morton Subotnick, Ramón Sender, and Pauline Oliveros. In 1963, Riley went to Paris, where he moonlighted as a nightclub pianist and composed music for The Gift, an experimental theater piece by American performance artist Ken Dewey. Working with Chet Baker and his band, Riley recorded each player separately in order to manipulate their parts, in an early form of remixing; he asked a studio engineer if it would be possible to create a looping delay, imagining a sound that might build up “magically.” The engineer’s solution was to run the tape through a pair of reel-to-reel recorders—one set to record and the other to play, with the second machine feeding back into the first. The results were revelatory. Years later, speaking to jazz guitarist Henry Kaiser, Riley described the effect as a hypnotic synthesis of intention and surprise. “It has a geometric order and a periodicity, but it becomes this gently moving landscape, so things come into it and fade out of it…You get this caravan of ideas that go on and on, and constantly change.” Riley came up with an appropriately science-fiction-sounding name for it: the time-lag accumulator. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Riley applied his time-lag accumulator in different contexts. On electric organ, he experimented with long delays of several seconds or more that allowed him to create intricate counterpoints, as though he were duetting with himself; he also explored millisecond-long slap-back delays, which created an illusion of space—as though he were performing on the rim of a canyon, each note bouncing back from the far side. On his early classic A Rainbow in Curved Air, recorded in 1968 and released in 1969, he used eight-track recording to create densely filigreed polyphonic fugues, but he also applied the technique in live performance. Newly reissued, Descending Moonshine Dervishes is a landmark in his catalog of keyboard works. The album is an early iteration of a style that would become known by various names—kosmische, new age, ambient, trance—yet was, for the moment, unknown territory, a groundbreaking blend of Indian raga, minimalist drone, and technological wizardry. In the music’s crystalline churn, conventional timekeeping melts away, as fluid as one of Salvador Dalí’s clocks. Recorded live in Berlin in 1975 but not released until 1982, Descending Moonshine Dervishes represents a continuation of the cadenza-like improvisations Riley captured on Persian Surgery Dervishes, recorded between 1971 and 1972 in Los Angeles and Paris. The titles of both albums, with their reference to Sufism’s whirling worshippers, offer a sense of the spinning motions of the music, a blur of arpeggiated figures and knotty patterns spread across the left and right hands. On both albums, he used a Yamaha YC 45D electric organ whose signal was routed into a complex delay chain, and in both cases, the organ was modified to play in just intonation, a tuning system whose bright, wide-open intervals sound faintly alien to listeners accustomed to Western music’s equal temperament. Trying to tease out specific differences between Descending Moonshine Dervishes and Persian Surgery Dervishes is a little bit like comparing a single stretch of river in different weather conditions. But where the keyboard in the 1971-72 concerts is warm and radiant, with an almost churchly cast, Descending Moonshine Dervishes strikes a more unsettling note, brittle and occasionally buzzing with overtones. Riley’s chords feel subtly distorted, bent out of shape. Listening to the way certain chords seem to pull away from the root note, I imagine magnetic fields at work. In places, the organ’s reed-like tone sounds almost medieval, conjuring images of felt-hatted pipers in cobblestoned town squares, even though Riley’s repertoire of polyrhythms and melodic figures are rooted in the ragas that he was studying in India with the classical singer Pandit Pran Nath. “It’s not rocket science,” Riley quipped of his technique. But even if you know the nuts and bolts of how he made the music, it’s difficult to parse the underlying mechanics. You might be able to pinpoint the slap-back delay, but any attempt to decipher which hand is playing what, or which phrases are an effect of the tape as opposed to being played in real time, is futile. The peculiarities of the Yamaha organ, with its two manuals, multiple registers, and tone-control levers, lend to shape-shifting timbres. Riley is a remarkably dexterous player even without the use of effects; hearing him here, equipped with what for the time was a novel and high-tech setup, it’s hard to fathom that just two hands are responsible for everything that comes streaming from the speakers, with no overdubs. Over the album’s 51-minute runtime, the music is constantly evolving. Slow, contemplative melodies morph imperceptibly into icy waterfalls of trebly tones and back into bassy dirges. Sweetly consonant harmonies suddenly curdle, throwing off sour, confusing dissonance. Tinkling chimes suggest angelic symphonies. Occasionally, a phased buzz anticipates the tubular glow of early Oneohtrix Point Never. Yet all these changes happen totally seamlessly, and with something approaching bliss. Around this time, Riley was performing all-night concerts, giving him an even more ample canvas to experiment with his psychedelically enveloping ideas. Descending Moonshine Dervishes likewise feels like a snapshot of a much longer continuum, a brief snippet of infinity rendered in the most rapturous terms. One of the central motifs, a rising and falling four-note figure, is almost childlike; I imagine a five-year-old’s singsong query—“Are we there yet?”—repeated over and over as the landscape flies by the backseat windows in a blur. The pleasure, of course, is in the journey; the joy of Riley’s piece is in deferring the final destination as long as possible.

Phiik,Carrot Season,7.6,Rap,"The defining moment for Phiik and Lungs so far remains a grainy video of the duo standing before racks of t-shirts in a Hoboken vintage store, rapping like their lives depend on it. As a droning loop unfurls and a raspy voice croaks, “What the fuck is good,” two boyish-looking white guys emerge, black hoodies cinched around their faces. Lungs, whose blond brows and eyelashes intensify his unblinking gaze, raps like a wartime Morse code transmission, warning of an impending anxiety attack. His skinny frame is almost alien; he jabs a bony index finger at each syllable to ensure the doomsday message sinks in. Behind him, Phiik bobs like a sidelined AND1 hooper, occasionally mouthing along. When he’s up, he darts to the mic, immediately unwinding a percussive flow that ripples and sputters like raindrops on a drumhead. “Life is anything but a dream,” he spits, “and I’m foaming at the mouth.” The video, which was filmed for Top Shelf Premium’s Off Top freestyle series, captures the sheer intensity of Phiik and Lungs as a duo. Their chemistry comes easy. They both grew up on Long Island and have been friends since high school, sharing an admiration of early Def Jux and Wu-Tang records. In 2014, Lungs joined Tase Grip, the New York City collective founded by AKAI SOLO. Phiik quickly followed suit. Theirs is a tape-saturated, dusty-but-digital sound, fresh and immediate but strikingly outside of time. The four entries in the pair’s Another Planet series, all produced by Lungs himself under the moniker LoneSword, are full of frantic, imagistic rapping over distressed samples and the occasional brittle drum loop. On Another Planet 4, the two pushed their eccentric flows further than before, partly to see if they could, but mostly, as Phiik put it on the Reel Notes podcast, to “bang ‘em over the head.” Houston producer Olasegun helms the boards on their new album Carrot Season, providing sunlit, loungey beats full of vibraphones, chorused guitars, and crisp Pete Rock snares. It’s still highly insular music, a mesmerizing deluge of internal rhymes and intricately arranged syllables, surely the product of round-the-clock recording sessions and bottomless bags of weed. But the rappers have more fully developed the contours of their voices, adding shading and depth to what could otherwise come off as exhaustingly mechanical. Much of the record’s buoyancy comes from Phiik and Lungs’s palpable love for the craft. It’s clear they’re both committed to rap as a practice, fascinated by the mechanics and malleability of language (in that same Reel Notes interview, Phiik recalls seeing a garbage bag full of Lungs’s rhyme books, each page filled to the margins). Lungs still raps like a ticker tape printout but finds the areas of give in his once-rigid cadence. On songs like “Who // Eagle Eye” and “Kurt McBurt,” he thaws his creaking monotone with a soft lilt, giving his rambly, punctuation-free lines a bit more space. Phiik’s flow is lithe, often graceful, bouncing between drums like protons seeking a negative charge. He’ll fixate on a particular sound and observe it from all angles, like on “Daily Operation:” “Sunrises with only psilocybin and simple silence/I’m breaking the science behind waking up a sleeping giant.” Neither rapper seems concerned with narrative, following instead a bent internal logic, each bugged-out image melting into the next. Phiik issues left-field roasts of lesser emcees, like on “PSG Grip,” when he explains that “every rapper an alcoholic missing their lederhosen.” Lungs often pens evocative single-line character studies, like how “the custy on a girls’ trip to the Galapagos Islands” or that “the plug’s kid a psychotic mess, if left unchecked, would be the next Putin.” Phiik imagines his death as the end of a race in Mario Kart; Lungs brews a special herbal tea, which he warns is “not legal for obvious reasons.” An off-the-cuff, communal vibe permeates Carrot Season, as though the album is a long-lost Stretch and Bobbito freestyle session, with rappers like AKAI SOLO and Homeboy Sandman showing up to kick a quick verse and linger in the blunt rotation. Given its density and hour-long runtime, the record’s vibrant colors can sometimes bleed together. It’s a lot to wrap your arms around, especially given Olasegun’s proclivity for slippery beat switches and jarring, interstitial samples. Still, Carrot Season goes down remarkably easy, the goopy, psychotropic reduction you’d get if you left Funcrusher Plus and Table Scraps on to boil.",0,"September 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phiik-lungs-carrot-season/
Bullion,Affection,8.0,Electronic,"The backstory of a Bullion song is never obvious. All that’s legible are stray details—a name, a place, an age—silhouetted in the warm light of emotional afterglow. In “Hula,” my favorite song from 2020’s We Had a Good Time, he hinted at stolen moments on dancefloors in Tokyo, Mexico, and Berlin (no further context; guess you had to be there) and asked, out of nowhere, “Are people in pain where you are?” That a bittersweet synth-pop track so perfectly suited for swaying cheek to cheek coincided with the onset of the novel coronavirus made the question feel uncannily apropos. The British singer, songwriter, and producer born Nathan Jenkins similarly blends the vague with the vivid on “Your Father,” one of the standouts on his new album, Affection. Over characteristically subtle production—a fistful of agates for a synth line; flashing shoals of guitar and sax—he sketches out the blurriest fragments of a private memory, then twists the focus ring: “Your father/Listened to/The whole of/The White Album/As he waited to collect us.” No matter how many times I rewind the line, I can’t quite make sense of it. I can see it: chaperone, tape deck on the dashboard, an hour that Dad spent killing time while the kids got up to who knows what. But the specifics are indistinct, known only to Jenkins and the “you” of the song. Bullion’s vignettes are just that: sharp in the center, darkened around the margins of the frame. But you don’t come to Bullion’s music for the stories, really; you come for the sound, and he has never sounded more in control of his craft than on Affection. Since the late 2000s, Jenkins has been developing an idiosyncratic style that’s hard to sum up, in spite of its elegant restraint. You could call it retro-conscious electro pop with one foot in UK dance music; you could also simply call it pop, or at least the kind of pop you’d expect from someone who’s produced Carly Rae Jepsen and Nilüfer Yanya. He calls it “Pop, not slop”—also the name of a long-running playlist he maintains on Spotify. Whatever that term may lack in precision or pith, the playlist efficiently triangulates Jenkins’ musical coordinates. It’s full of sophistipop, electrified yacht rock, Japanese city pop, mellower strains of new wave, and, above all, the odd curveball from ’70s rockers who greeted the next decade by spending major-label money on top-of-the-line synths and drum machines. Bullion’s music is steeped in the liminal areas where genres blend promiscuously and digital reverb bleeds across acoustic guitars and gridded click tracks. If his tales feel like strangers’ snapshots found in a box at the flea market, his songs have an equally vintage tint, shot through with a déjà vu quality that makes them feel like you’ve heard them before, but can’t quite place where. In the listener-friendly tradition of pop music, Jenkins keeps his songs around the three-minute mark, and sometimes shorter. “Cinch,” the album’s sleekest encapsulation of yearning, is a scale model of bittersweet, just two minutes of pulsing arpeggios, wordless coos, and a delicious little twist in the chord change that gets me every time. His arrangements are more pared back than ever; why use two synths when one will do? But his sounds have never been more sumptuous. The keys drip with liquid texture, glow like runway lights through a rain-spattered window; voices sail into earshot on flying carpets of reversed reverb, giving songs the feeling of moving backward and forward at once. Jenkins delights in toying with expectations: “A City’s Never,” featuring an unusually understated Panda Bear, bookends a single verse in a chorus as spotless as an electric-vehicle showroom, then twists up the bassline in its final moments, slyly throwing a toylike wrench in the works. Other songs feel like conduits for fleeting moments of joy: You may come to “Rare” for Jepsen’s heart-warming vocal harmonies, but it’s the 18-second guitar solo near the end that keeps you hitting replay. Just once does he go a little gonzo, with the fiddle and harmonica of “World_train,” featuring Charlotte Adigéry—probably my least favorite song here, though I applaud the gung-ho spirit. And sometimes a song that seems otherwise unremarkable, like the strummy “Open Hands,” suddenly assumes a more vivid shape, as though its strings had been pulled taut. Jenkins executive-produced Avalon Emerson’s & the Charm, in which the American DJ reinvented herself as the frontwoman of a group, and he assumes a similar role here, roping a dozen or so session players and backup vocalists into streamlined songs that spin like tightly wound clocks. You can visualize the imaginary band on stage—here’s the drummer, there’s the bassist; the keys are mapped across left-hand chords and right-hand leads. A human sense of scale abides, even on songs that are almost certainly computer-assisted studio concoctions. A surprisingly large number of guitarists are on hand, given the instrument’s unobtrusive role—but when a solo like the one Joe Newman plays in “Your Father” floats to the surface, it lights up the room. Bassist Ben Reed, who played on Frank Ocean’s Blond and Endless, deserves a nod as the album’s stealth MVP; his work can be muscular, lithe, and lighthearted, sometimes all at once. He brings livewire funk to the glistening “Affection,” dutifully powers the middle-school slow dance of “Rare,” quickens the pulse of “Your Father” like a brand new crush. The guest singers never steal the spotlight. Panda Bear’s Noah Lennox comes closest, only because he has such a distinctive drawl, but Jenkins does something clever with the mix that leaves Lennox’s voice trailing his own, like an angled shadow. Jepsen and Adigéry also lie low, inconspicuous as friendly ghosts. Jenkins’ presence is affable, modest, and muted—almost like a backup vocalist on his own songs. He sings with his head voice, slightly nasal, but there’s no shortage of warmth or tenderness in his tone. More than anything, he knows the value of simplicity. Take “Once, in a Borrowed Car”: There are no verses, just a chorus that’s repeated five times, with minuscule variations. “Bullet down the highway,” he sings, drawing out the first word until it feels like a speeding projectile caught in slow motion; “Body blow/The body knows/Rushing to your location/To seek affection.” In those five slim lines, we’re transported into the act of desire itself. We may not know where he’s going, or to whom, or what force caused that body blow, but it hardly matters. For three minutes and change, between the blushing close harmonies and hiccupping piano solo, that desire feels as real as the blood pumping in your veins.

Bbymutha,Sleep Paralysis,7.7,Rap,"Put bbymutha’s catalog on shuffle and get shrewd lessons on lousy lovers, tips for freaky sexcapades, and uplifting quotes for your mirror Post-its. In 2017, the video for her song “Rules” catapulted her to underground fame right from its breathless opening line: “You can’t give your pussy to a nigga who not used to getting pussy ’cause that pussy gon’ be everybody business.” Her unsparing candor resonated, earning her a cosign from Björk and a tour opening for Earl Sweatshirt. But for bbymutha, the way some of her early music was received felt at odds with what she intended. Speaking on “Rules” in a recent interview, she decried it as a “bad memory,” reflecting, as have other artists before her, on the paradox of Black pain being received as party music: “People really want you to turn up to your trauma with them.” On her latest album, sleep paralysis, she insists on setting the terms of the turn up. Much has changed since she made “Rules.” She’s moved up from her grandma’s crumbling house in Chattanooga to her own place in Atlanta. And for the first time she’s released a record with the backing of a label, the New York-based indie outfit True Panther. sleep paralysis is a freewheeling and exuberant ride through grimy electronic music and dark, bass-heavy Southern rap—and it’s some of the most fun music she’s made to date. She wrote the album in London, in between tour stops, and half the tracks echo sounds heard on British dancefloors, from skittering drum’n’bass to spooky dancehall. The oozing bassline and driving breakbeats of “Piss!” are busy enough to stand alone as an instrumental. But rather than get swallowed by the production (co-helmed by East London rapper and singer LYAM), bbymutha slides into the pockets of the beat, using her voice more like an instrument. It’s a weird and exciting start that gets weirder with the industrial booty bass of “head x shoulders.” Over buoyant 808s coated in the kind of instrumental debris that recalls the best of M.I.A., bbymutha, who turned a slight into her stage name, continues her mission of reappropriation by puffing up her chest to say she’s “proud to be a bastard.” The standout of her UK sojourn is “Lines,” a big-beat banger that uses a cocaine metaphor (“He wanna cut me like the lines on the dresser”) to confront a lover who’s not walking the walk. But on the chaotic “Tony Hawk,” bbymutha’s own words get lost and her voice feels too much like an ornament in the production. So it’s refreshing to hear her get back to familiar territory in the album’s second half, where her lyrics shine and her growth as a rapper is clear. Mutant Academy’s resident producer Foisey channels Project Pat on “ghostface,” a menacing highlight that bleeds with passion as bbymutha rails against her opps, threatening to jump them with her kids. “final girl” plays with pacing and internal rhymes (“I watch bitches giggle, be tickled by my misfortune/I pull up and give abortions, might dabble in some extortion”) over a trap beat from the netherworld. On “Mutha Massacre” she taps into Tennessee horrorcore, painting a disturbingly vivid image of dragging a dead man by his genitalia. As fun as it is to hear her flex different styles, she hasn’t exhausted the potential of her Southern rap roots. Vulnerability can be empowering but it can also be exploited; it’s tempting to believe that keeping things in is the only safe choice. On closing track “go!,” bbymutha rejects that defensive posture, choosing to open up about romantic attachment that slips into possessiveness and neediness. This music draws on a different kind of vulnerability: Where “Rules” was founded in the regret of a failed relationship, “go!” channels in the reckless abandon of a happy one. Bbymutha may not be able to control how her art is received, but she’s still willing to take the risk of disclosure. This time, she shows us that good, honest music doesn’t have to come from bad memories; there’s gold to be mined from happy ones too.

Lucky Daye,Algorithm,7.3,Pop/R&B,"As the singer of unforgettable tracks like “Over” and “Love You Too Much,” and as a songwriter on Ella Mai’s “10,000 Hours” and Beyoncé’s “Alien Superstar,” Lucky Daye’s spent at least a decade cultivating a terrarium of earworm hits. On this third album, Algorithm, Daye reunites with Dernst “D’Mile” Emile II, whose agile production can be heard on An Evening With Silk Sonic and Victoria Monet’s Jaguar series as well as Daye’s first two albums. The duo’s balance of retro-soul and future-R&B is a little left of center, freewheeling without any discernible label, and focuses on instrumental exploration and playful genre-melding. Across Algorithm’s 14 tracks, live-band seduction pulls you out of the club shadows and into the light of a Delta dancefloor. Opener “Never Leavin’ U Lonely” is a sexy party trick, the type of song that sneaks up and surprises as it builds from its percussive backline into Daye’s falsetto vocals. It’s a high that continues onto the hip-swinging “HERicane,” the shoulder shimmying “Soft,” and the heart-pounding “Top.” The latter brings to mind the instructional foreplay of Eugene Wilde’s “Gotta Get You Home Tonight,” whose influence is felt in Daye’s plea for an itinerant lover’s time and interest: “I feel your body breathin’ but let’s not take a break…/Like sugar on my tongue till your body go numb/Then I’ma send you on your way.” Just because it’s a one-night stand doesn’t mean it’s over—Daye wants you to remember the first glance and the last climax. At its best, the album recalls the dynamic sensual abandon of Nile Rodgers as Daye rides over the grooves and edges of a melody. He never seems to be addressing a crowd: He is seeing and singing to you. Fans of old-school R&B ballads bemoan that today’s singers don’t beg like they used to, that there’s no urgency in their pining. Daye is prostrate, submitting to desire. When he steps away from that vulnerable longing, though, the album starts to meander with the listlessness of an automated “sex songs” playlist. “Think Different,” “Mary,” “Blame,” and the title track attempt to engage with the contemporary dating scene’s surplus of choices and dearth of intimacy, but the real problem never comes into clear focus and the songs wind up sounding like one-way romantic pontificating. “Mary” in particular feels quite archaic as Daye consults a Rolodex of women he’s met in each and every part of town. “Got a girl named Jill, stay up in the hills,” he brags, and so on, revealing nothing except the fact that there are still young women named Ruth. “Think Different” could have been a necessary dialogue between two people working to understand each other better, but it hits like a voice note from a partner who still wants to fight for the relationship but is increasingly resentful of all the work it’s taking. By contrast, British singer-songwriter RAYE takes command on “Paralyzed,” laying the stakes for a truly transformative love: “Intuition says, ‘Run for the door, save yourself’/But to leave both you and my heart in this room, I would’ve played myself.” Begging is all well and good, but relationships demand the courage to act. Algorithm sounds tactile and magnetic: The harmonies are slick but never processed and the beats are in the pocket but never quantized. The emotional picture is less clear. Daye sounds as though he longs to sink deeper into territory that requires him to become a little more uncertain, not only about the implications of desire and love, but what it means to express them while still growing as a musician. He’s committed himself to the labor of love—distilling all its tempestuous, petty, tender, and annoying traits into music that speaks as much to us as to his continued maturation. It’s a thrill to see an artist reach for that depth of feeling. Like love, it can be elusive.",0,"July 9, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lucky-daye-algorithm/
Elyanna,Woledto,7.7,Pop/R&B,"This past Valentine’s Day, Elyanna opened the Chicago date of her first North American tour by performing the title track of her debut album, Woledto. Lured onstage by the mallet drumming of a tabla baladi and the spellbinding melody of an electroacoustic oud, the Palestinian Chilean singer-songwriter took the mic draped in angelic white. “And I ask myself after my absence,” she trilled in Arabic. “Heartbrokenly: Why did I go away/When your love was above the stars?” To reach the stars—and last year’s Coachella stage—Elyanna has summoned sounds that cross time, space, and dialects, simultaneously ancient and ultramodern. Raised in Nazareth, with roots in Viña del Mar, Chile, she emigrated to California when she was 15. Now, at 22, her sound carries the weight of her diasporic identity, channeling the honeyed style of Nancy Ajram or a young Dalida with the playful attitude of Shakira or Rihanna. Building on self-titled EPs from 2020 and 2022, Woledto (or I Am Born) plays with Arab pop, R&B, EDM, and jazz to express the nuances of love, loss, and longing. Where her EPs balanced SWANA-inspired elements with concessions to Western pop, perhaps hoping to acclimate Anglophone audiences, Woledto sounds liberated, prioritizing audacity over assimilation. In many ways, Woledo is part of a long oral tradition, embracing elements of Levantine folk, tribal fusion dance, and zajal (an Andalusi Arabic form of oral strophic poetry). Elyanna’s lyrics honor the influences that define her artistic lineage. “Did love strike you?/Or were you thrown with arrows?/This is just the nature of a man in love!/Come on and give me cups of it,” she sings on “Lel Ya Lel” (“Night Oh Night”), evoking the pain and romance of the ghazal poeticism of Egyptian musical icons Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez. One minute Elyanna is riffing maqam scales; the next she’s wailing, “You’ve forgotten to remember me and erased our past,” backed by a sample of her grandfather, a zajal wedding singer. The whole album is a multigenerational effort, each friend and family member adding a layer to the collective memory. Elyanna co-wrote most tracks with her mother, Abeer; her brother Feras serves as pianist and creative director. He’s also co-credited as executive producer alongside two of Elyanna’s longtime mentors, the Lebanese Canadian R&B singer Massari and Nasri Atweh of the reggae-pop band Magic!. (It was Atweh who first encouraged Elyanna to sing in Arabic after discovering her covers of English-language pop songs.) Even her sister and stylist Tali leaves her imprint on the music, supplying the gold coins that ring out between the tabla, trumpet, and tambourines of “Ganeni” (“Make Me Crazy”). Two of the album’s nine tracks are elaborate reinterpretations of contemporary classics. “Callin’ U (Tamally Maak)” is a bilingual mash-up of Danish hip-hop group Outlandish’s “Callin U,” itself a take on Egyptian pop singer Amr Diab’s “Tamally Maak” (“Always With You”), a 2000 guitar ballad that became an international smash, adapted into Spanish, Russian, Hindi, Kannada, Romanian, Greek, and more. With just this one track, Elyanna strikes a chord that vibrates worldwide. The lead single, “Al Sham,” emerges as an electro-raï anthem, sampling “N’ta Goudami,” by the late Algerian folk singer and “mother of raï” Cheikha Rimitti. Meanwhile, in its lyrics, Elyanna reimagines Aleppine tenor Sabah Fakhri’s 1970 composition “Khamrat El Hob” (“The Vintage of Love”). “A life without love is a stream without water,” she sings in a simmering glissando that eventually erupts like a whistling kettle. Against an original synth dabke bridge, Elyanna employs Bedouin-esque chants, ululations, and the metallic swooshes of drawn swords, conjuring the rage and urgency of a warrior preparing for battle. But tune out the intensity and you’ll hear a syrupy Elyanna croon (in English) “I’m ready for the water.” Elyanna has downplayed the political undertones in her music, but Woledto represents her most socially charged project yet. Across the album, subtle yet poignant references to identity, displacement, and cultural resilience underscore her sorrow and ferocity. She brings her own perspective to Arab hits most often interpreted by men and celebrates her feminist inspirations, whether through direct sampling, stylistic channeling, or collaborative work. On the tambourine-tinged anthem “Mama Eh,” a pissed-off Elyanna seeks her mother’s wisdom to cope with unrequited love and constructs a rallying cry for women in search of matriarchal strength. Elyanna’s debut album comes at a tumultuous moment. On one hand, her star is ascendant. At the same time, Palestine—her homeland—is in crisis. Children of the Arab diaspora never forget where they came from. After all, “How can a soul forget someone it adores?” Elyanna muses on the closing piano ballad “Sad in Pali.” The intangible echoes of our beginnings linger in nostalgic realms like music and movement, practices that evoke the abstract idea we call home. “Through distance, you’ll learn the meaning of togetherness,” Elyanna reassures in the outro, reciting a poem written by her mother. “Through distance, your heart will learn the meaning of drought/And your heart will learn the taste of return/After the wait.” It’s a declaration that reverberates far beyond the stage.",0,"April 23, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/elyanna-woledto/
JPEGMAFIA,I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU,6.9,Rap,"The exact moment that NBA player Dillon Brooks lost the mandate of heaven: After poking the bear of LeBron James in the 2023 playoffs, failing to live up to his own slanderous trash-talk while his aggressive style of play floundered on the court, Brooks unceremoniously hit free agency as the Memphis Grizzlies leaked that he wouldn’t be re-signed “under any circumstances.” Brooks’ story appears as an omen on “i scream this in the mirror before i interact with anyone,” the opening track on JPEGMAFIA’s fifth studio album, I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU. In the first lines, the 34-year-old Baltimore rapper—whose iconoclastic presence is forged on a confrontational mix of noise, rap, and punk—likens himself to a worse version of Brooks as cymbals titter in the background. It’s an initiation to JPEG’s caustic humor laced with a smidge of accidental wisdom: You can play the role of the tireless provocateur as long as you continue to deliver. On I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU, JPEG entrenches himself in the agitator role. The follow-up to his 2023 Danny Brown collaboration Scaring the Hoes is blanketed in frenetic energy, as if JPEG can’t decide where to aim first. At times his extremely online subject matter takes the bloom off his writing. But his innate ability to shift between breakneck flows amid chaotic production buoys the album. In a 2023 interview, JPEG said that he aspires to create music that “tears you out of yourself.” On I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU, it feels as though he’s tearing in 30 directions at once, incorporating a dizzying mix of genres seemingly at random. The imperfect marriage of a 2014 Future sample and a persistent whirring sound on “New Black History” registers as grating rather than electrifying; his chants and growls in “vulgar display of power” are eroded by a blistering rock backdrop. At other points his glitchy, staccato raps fit seamlessly with the production’s entropy: on “it’s dark and hell is hot,” a 170 bpm Brazilian funk production assisted by DJ RaMeMes, or over a staticky Jade sample on “I’ll Be Right There.” As it did on his 2018 release Veteran, JPEG’s ability to walk the line between distortion and discord permits the industrial chaos to feel somehow familiar—as if the only thing more jarring would be unified sound direction. No matter the subject, JPEG’s raps never shy away from confrontation (he described the Drake disses on “New Black History” and “it’s dark and hell is hot” as “throwaway bars”). On I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU, he continues to hip fire with an air of superiority: “Fake-plug-talkin’ Tubi rappers/Got a machine behind ’em, and still they can’t fill up capacity with they raps,” he spits on “SIN MIEDO.” There’s room to take aim at white people who act Black and shit-talkers with their own skeletons in the closet, all while keeping pace with a fun Denzel Curry appearance. His pop culture references are simple and high-powered: Calling himself the “Black Michael Phelps” is objectively funny. The nonstop airing of grievances is entertaining, but eventually it can feel like JPEG’s off-the-cuff trolls are reaching critical mass. There’s wanton carelessness in using “African booty scratcher” as an insult while also claiming that he scares people “that ain’t got no Black friends.” He’ll go and liken himself to the IDF on the five-minute opus “Exmilitary,” then name the next track “JIHAD JOE,” not bothering to adjust for the contradictions between his personality and political commentary. It would be less honest for JPEGMAFIA to shy away from those contradictions. His general state of defiance—molded by his honorable discharge from the U.S. Air Force and his experiences with racism growing up in Alabama, filtered through his fluency in meme culture—informs the best aspects of his artistry. In trying to parse through the idea of being a Black man, a Black artist rapping to a predominantly white fanbase, in an online landscape full of censorship and disinformation, the line between performance and survival is razor-thin. Sometimes the shocking statement is a method of protecting one’s true self; other times it’s an actual window into the artist’s soul. “I’m so terminally online, goddamn, I gotta check myself,” he raps on “JIHAD JOE.” The musical highs of I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU lift JPEG above the potential pitfalls of this highwire act, but the cautionary tale of Dillon Brooks is never far from mind.",0,"August 8, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jpegmafia-i-lay-down-my-life-for-you/
Rosie Lowe,"Lover, Other",7.6,Pop/R&B,"Even in the midst of slippery, unpredictable production, Rosie Lowe’s voice has always been the most undeniable force in her music. The English artist’s melodic inclinations are front and center on her early alt-R&B and soul albums, 2016’s Control and 2019’s YU, and collaborations, like her stunning 2021 album with Duval Timothy, Son. On Lowe’s third solo studio album, Lover, Other, she channels the raw immediacy of Son into even bolder explorations. While Rosie will always wow with the sheer beauty of her voice, here, perhaps for the first time, she’s crafted an album that rides off the strength of its sterling, restless, and inventive production. Lover, Other conveys a sense of emotional directness in its lyrics. Lowe is at times confident, braggadocious, and completely convinced that she is the shit. Elsewhere, though—oftentimes immediately after these uplifting moments—Lowe retreats into a shell, unsure of her worth, purpose, and relationship to others. On “Mood to Make Love,” Lowe tantalizingly croons over a perfectly dusty bassline and barely-there percussion, singing, “Bet you never met a girl like me/Never knew how tough I’d be/Walked out the sea dripping gold.” It’s on that last word that Lowe throws in a number of vocal layers, giving the proclamation a shimmering spotlight. On the very next track, “In My Head,” the drums are grooving and the bassline recalls the soul-funk of fellow UK chameleons SAULT. Lowe, however, is decidedly less grounded than moments before: “I was in my head/Couldn't get it out/Be such a shame/If I could be without,” she sings. The album’s production, which Lowe handled alongside Harvey Grant and D’Monk, mirrors the constantly shifting self-reflection in the lyrics. Lowe wanted to record in a way that was unencumbered by complex recording setups, so she took a miniature mobile studio across Europe and visited collaborators, heading to Florence, Berlin, Barcelona, and her hometown of Devon. It results in a certain level of playfulness and sonic variety across the album, like on the love song “Walk In The Park,” where an affected old Rhodes pops up to say hello. The latter half of the record is decidedly less formal than the former, with Lowe untethering her voice from beats and verse-chorus structure, choosing instead to wash her voice in vocoders (“Don’t Go”) and minimal arrangements consisting of simple drum beats and bass lines that move in and out of the rhythmic pocket. It’s in these looser compositions that Lowe’s production truly shines. Outside the main vocal melody of “Out of You,” the song is rich with the sound of static rain, breathy horn textures, and chopped vocal squawks. “Lay Me” begins with multiple vocal lines floating over a piano groove before shifting into a neo-soul song in conversation with the Soulquarians; its percussion—a brushed snare drum and a floor tom-like sound so loose it’s as if the head is barely on the instrument—emphasizes Lowe’s exacting vision as a producer. Elsewhere, Lowe flexes her pop muscles, like in the clever interactions between clicking percussion, swishing hi hats, a walking bassline, and Rosie’s rich vocal textures on “Gratitudes.” Lowe has created something daring and unwavering in Lover, Other. In using her most provocative production to date, she doesn’t dim the shine of her primary instrument—instead, she highlights its brilliance.

Various Artists,Kampire Presents: A Dancefloor in Ndola,7.7,,"Ndola, Zambia’s third largest city, is best known internationally for copper mining and the imposing Levy Mwanawasa stadium. On the evidence of A Dancefloor in Ndola, a new compilation from East African DJ Kampire, the city should also be celebrated for its joyful party vibes and cosmopolitan dancefloors, whose music is so riotously funky it threatens to shake the Levy Mwanawasa to its foundations. Kampire, born in Kenya to Ugandan parents, lived in Ndola from the ages of two to 18. A Dancefloor in Ndola is inspired by the songs she absorbed during this period—in particular, via her father’s record collection—including a range of music from Eastern and Southern Africa, from soukous to township bubblegum, drawn largely from the 1980s and early ’90s. There is a heavy emphasis on women singers, including Congolese heroes Pembey Sheiro and Feza Shamamba and South Africa’s V-Mash and Di Groovy Girls. The album isn’t mixed but it’s admirably constructed. Kampire, like any DJ worth their salt, is skilled at teasing out connections between disparate sounds. A Dancefloor in Ndola shows the art of the DJ as selector, joining the dots between musical trends in a way that flows effortlessly onto the dancefloor. Several years and thousands of miles lie between Princess Aya Sarah’s “O Wina Tienge” and the African House Party Project ft. Splash, Patricia Majalisa, and Dalom Kids’ “P-Coq,” the first and third songs on this compilation. But Kampire’s clever selection highlights the similarities between the florid, funky soukous of the “O Wina Tienge” and the rolling pop house of “P-Coq,” with sturdy kick-drum thump, call-and-response vocals, and late-’80s/early-’90s sonic palette running through both songs’ sinuous grooves. The way that “P-Coq” then gives way to V-Mash’s gloriously headstrong “Naughty Boy,” whose clubby production and vocal strut suggest a South African Madonna at her most Brat, makes for a jubilant extension of musical throughlines. This combination—bass-drum-heavy beats, time-stamped electronic instrumentation, and intricate vocal arrangements—dominates A Dancefloor in Ndola. The parallels with wider club culture are self-evident. Princesse Mansia M’bila’s “Ngoma Mansia” and Samba Mapangala and Orchestra Virunga’s “Mashariki” are absolutely pounding, repetitive and hypnotic in a way that will be familiar to anyone who has experienced Tanzanian singeli (or, indeed, emerged from a club into broad daylight). But there are enough exceptions to the rule for the compilation to breathe. The syncopated saxophone skip of Lady Isa’s “Djambo” provides blissful air midway through, while Founders Band’s “Kimbera” tops off the record on a less regimented note. Its fuzzy and slightly imperfect sound turns out to be the perfect way to end A Dancefloor in Ndola’s theoretical night out. Kampire also masters the DJ’s art of ferreting out obscure records and turning them into your new favorite songs. Perhaps the African House Party Project’s “P-Coq” was well known locally when it was released in 1991, but its appearance here elevates the song to the upper ranks of early-’90s house anthems, thanks to its yearning vocals and production that fuses local musical ideas with house’s voracious appetite for new sounds. Di Groovy Girls’ “Ririmi Rotsombela,” an effervescent piece of township bubblegum for which Kampire provides her own “Dance Edit,” is so catchy, from its irresistible synth riff downward, that it feels like it should have been world-conquering. Most listeners to this compilation will never visit Ndola, but the evocative power of A Dancefloor in Ndola makes you feel like you almost have—like you too might have sweated out a night at the center of Zambia’s Copperbelt Province to the continent’s greatest electronic pop bangers. This is dance music at its transportive, revelatory best, a real reminder of what an astute, inventive DJ can do. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Cola,The Gloss,7.6,Rock,"In the dozen or so years that Tim Darcy and Ben Stidworthy have been playing together—first in Ought, and now, with drummer Evan Cartwright, as Cola—their music’s defining characteristics haven’t changed much. The two still specialize in a knotty, post-punky brand of indie rock embedded with cryptic yet conversational observations about maintaining one’s sanity in the modern world. But when you compare Ought’s 2014 debut, More Than Any Other Day, to the music Cola are making now, it’s like listening to completely different musicians—and the contrast goes beyond the fact that their current trio seemingly has no use for a keyboardist. Ought always sounded like a band in flux, unfurling their tightly wound sound for deeper explorations in drone and groove, while Darcy wielded his mercurial voice with theatrical aplomb. But Cola’s second album, The Gloss, is a model of focus, precision, and economy—the sound of players who know exactly who they are and what they want to do. Listening to The Gloss feels a lot like sitting in on a practice session in a windowless jam space the night before a gig—a nervous, claustrophobic tension hangs in the air, but everyone is completely locked in and buzzing with energy. Unlike like their pandemic-spawned, file-swapped 2022 debut, Deep in View, The Gloss was recorded as Cola came into their own as a touring act, and as such, the album foregrounds their intuition and rapport and keeps their spoken-word piano-jazz proclivities at bay. But while The Gloss renews Cola’s membership in a fraternity of prickly, leftfield guitar rock that runs through Television, Sonic Youth, and Women, they use their discord less to agitate than ingratiate. These tracks are largely confined to three-minute bursts, but each exhibits that special sense of discovery that results when close friends instinctively follow one another’s lead, and a simple chord change or strategic pause can instantly transform a song’s essence. Cuts like “Tracing Hallmarks” tick all the boxes on the contemporary post-punk checklist—jabbing guitar lines, propulsive rhythms, staccato phrasing—but they also shift into surprisingly congenial choruses that lend Cola uncommon lightness and levity. On “Albatross,” Darcy sings, “I’m a lame horse with an optimistic mind,” making explicit a theme running throughout: In a world that’s constantly trying to beat you down, staying positive constitutes an act of radicalism. Like Stephen Malkmus, Darcy favors language that’s equally evocative and enigmatic, routinely blurring the line between the sardonic and sincere. His most pointed social commentary comes through on “Down to Size,” which suggests an urban activist version of the Strokes: the song revisits the topic of gentrification previously referenced on Ought’s 2015 slow-burning masterpiece “Beautiful Blue Sky,” but at a more frantic pace that mirrors the ruthless breakneck speed of development. More often, he takes delight in overarching metaphors that simultaneously obscure and amplify his intent, whether using journalist lingo to frame a couple’s communication breakdown (“Pulling Quotes”) or invoking film-set imagery to highlight the performative aspects of daily life. (“My taste is avant-poor,” he cheekily declares on “Pallor Tricks,” and somewhere, a slumming trust-fund kid weeps.) If Darcy’s lyrics require putting in some work to decode them, the band makes musical immersion easy by consistently striking the familiar balance of dissonant sound, disjointed melody, and bone-dry production that defined indie rock’s late-’80s/early-’90s golden age, before synths, string sections, and festival-baiting choruses became de rigueur. When you hear Cola cruise on the perfect-sound-forever groove of “Nice Try” or unleash the clang and clamor of “Bell Wheel,” the effect is as poignant as it is powerful. The Gloss is a reassuring reminder that, however many iconoclastic rock heroes have recently fallen, their legacies are in good hands.

Chief Keef,Almighty So 2,8.4,Rap,"At just 28, Chief Keef has churned out dozens of projects in nearly as many different styles. His influence can be felt from rap’s top rung like Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert to the toasted digital landscapes of new-age acolytes like Xaviersobased and Devstacks. He’s one of the pioneers of the Chicago drill sound, and while there have been peaks and valleys—being a volume shooter often comes at the expense of a spotless track record—he’s never lost the thrilling “Lex Luger and Brick Squad dipped in the Chicago River” quality he’s been honing since the “Faneto” days. Even when he’d miss, the boldness of his experiments kept heads intrigued. One of those peaks was 2013’s Almighty So, a mixtape where Keef and a slew of producers melded drill with the chirpy cloud-rap-adjacent aesthetic that would soon populate SoundCloud. Street rappers weren’t spitting over production like Yung Lan’s “Ape Shit” or Abe Beats’ “Young Rambos” back then, and that adventurousness, coupled with bars comparing guns to dildos, turned Almighty So into a cult classic among fans and slightly younger contemporaries. Between arrests, label disputes, and being blacklisted from shows in his home city (until recently), Keef’s been through a lot on and off the mic over the last decade. Through it all, a sequel to Almighty So, first announced in 2018, has lingered in the margins. Despite Keef’s reservations about being hooked on drugs during that era, it garnered the kind of mythic status usually reserved for alt-rap team-ups and AAA albums that never were. But Almighty So 2 is real, as vibrant and busy and flippant as anything Keef’s ever made, a capstone that brings the first-wave drill he helped popularize screaming into the future. What stands out most about Almighty So 2 is just how different it is compared to the original. As opposed to hiring a dozen producers, Keef employs himself on all but one of 16 tracks. So 1 is airy and saturated, the audio equivalent of watching a neon sign flicker and short out. So 2 crashes in like the Kool-Aid man, leaving a trail of sticky footprints. It also borrows and mutates elements from other Keef extravaganzas: The Trap-A-Holics tributes dotted across this year’s Mike WiLL Made-It collab Dirty Nachos seem to have influenced the drops for fake radio station 4NEM Radio that pop up here; Ghanaian-Liberian comedian Michael Blackson, whose interludes powered much of 2013’s Bang Part 2, is back and desperately trying to make his DJ Drama-esque ad-libs funny. But these would just be nostalgic touches without Keef and his co-producers’ enveloping beats. On “Jesus Skit,” Blackson’s cloying bit about Black entertainers getting reparations is drowned out by Keef, Slowburnz, and MBZ’s production, their hellish keyboard stabs and Gatling-gun drums transitioning smoothly into Keef and longtime collaborator Lil Gnar’s verses on “Jesus.” It’s an update on an older formula that is fuller and more ambitious. Keef’s ear has always been geared toward the dramatic, and Almighty So 2 gives his gothic raps a new grandeur. His best songs have a certain rawness to them, but here, the mixes are crisper, more professional-sounding. Leveling up in the studio can sometimes mean sanding off the edges, but every one of these songs is diamond-sharp. “Almighty (Intro)” takes a sample of the oft-used Carl Orff composition “O Fortuna” and chops it up while snare drums flurry underneath, building tension as a voice levels affirmations and insults for over a minute (“Your mama could have you all over again, you still couldn’t be me”). Then Keef comes in and the drums gallop while he drops bizarre flexes (“She put my nut in her cup and she chased her Patrón”) and points out how his come-up was ordained: “I was born in ’95, I been ready since ’91…Sense a cougar headin’ for that ass? Boy, you better run.” It checks every box for a great rap intro and puts Keef in pole position to floor it. So 2 is this big all the way through. Keef stays restless, indulging wild thoughts and building them out to feature-length productions. “Drifting Away” is a marvel of Zaytoven-esque pianos, 808 thumps, glitching synths, and digital flutes that shimmer and stomp behind Keef’s money talk and jabs at Kanye West’s claims of innovating drill music. Ironically, it sounds far removed from drill, like it would’ve slotted as neatly on Uzi’s Eternal Atake or any one of TisaKorean’s last few albums. That’s the magic of Chief Keef—even when he’s sticking to the script, he can make the unexpected happen. Tierra Whack might not have been the first rapper to come to mind for a Keef collab, but she catches a vicious double-time flow over the back half of “Banded Up” that perfectly compliments Keef’s half-time yelps. Would you ever expect Keef to say “I start wearing yellow diamonds, it look like I peed myself” and comparing enemies to the old mascot for Honeycombs cereal over angelic choir vocals on “Treat Myself”? Or to work Bobby Womack and Wilson Pickett samples into a roaring vintage drill track on “1,2,3”? Or to fit triplet drum rolls over spiraling piano keys on “Neph Nem”? The fact that they all feel left-field and like no-brainers is a testament to Keef’s sustained ability to surprise after 15 years. With that confidence comes a new investment in his legacy. Keef’s still focused on present and future success, but he spends just as much of Almighty So 2 considering his arduous journey to the top. Regret and longing aren’t new to him, but at the end of his first verse on “Jesus,” he briefly works through the perspective shift that came with his move from Chicago to California. The streets of his mind are less active but he remembers every run-up. “Prince Charming” is one of several songs packed with the kind of memories treasured most by those who make it out: advice from his grandmother, the bologna that used to be on his plate, situations that made his “front yard look like a GTA car meet.” Chief Keef put out his first mixtape at 14, recorded his breakout song “I Don’t Like” two years later while on house arrest, and found himself at the center of a label bidding war before he was a legal adult. Think about where he’s come since then. While he’s had his fair share of blunders and petulant ignorance, Almighty So 2 has more consideration for what it means to be one of the most influential rapper-producers of his generation. There’s a sense that with a larger canvas, he’s being more careful with his words and more deliberate about creating the largest rendition of himself possible. This colors every moment on So 2, from threesomes in his home movie theater to the regret of being too gone off lean to enjoy his spoils. “I could live in the jungle and come out with a hyena hat,” he says plainly on “Believe,” like he’s savoring having the rap game in his hands. After carving your own lane, seeing it transform three times over, and living to talk about it before you turn 30, what better way is there to celebrate?",1,"May 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chief-keef-almighty-so-2/
Amen Dunes,Death Jokes,7.6,Rock,"Amen Dunes’ music is persuasive, but it’s not always clear what it’s trying to persuade you of. Since the release of his confrontationally noisy debut album, DIA, 15 years ago, Damon McMahon has continually refined the remit of his sound—shaving away the haze, juicing the elements drawn from pop and classic rock—but kept the narratives relatively oblique. Listening to his last album, 2018’s Freedom, felt a little like trying to read a Great American Novel by holding it up to a reflecting pool: ideas about loss and familial ties cut through, even if entire sentences were tough to string together. It was a personal record, but rarely a clarifying one; you got the sense that McMahon would rather keep his lyrics obscure than boil down his ideas into something digestible. The ideas on Death Jokes, his self-produced sixth album, are clearer. He is blunter and more forceful with specific meaning on this album than ever. Broadly, it is an apocalypse tale, in which humanity’s final moments on Earth are plagued by the same ills that have stalked us for centuries: hatred, greed, puritanism. Misunderstanding is a recurring theme, as is loneliness, specifically the kind that arises when the state fails to take care of its citizens. For all this pessimism, though, McMahon’s take on life, which he returns to again and again on Death Jokes, is simple and optimistic: “Some day we lose it/So use it.” These ideas are filtered through warped hip-hop and rave beats, although the peculiarities of McMahon’s phrasing and melodies—his music is always surging or undulating, rarely taking a streamlined route—mean that Death Jokes sounds quintessentially Amen Dunes. Whether bleating over a sputtering 909 on the Lil Peep-inspired “Rugby Child” or singing an electro-reggae lullaby on “Purple Land,” McMahon is at a point in his career where he could never be mistaken for anyone else, and although Death Jokes is filled with odd details, like the minimal techno interlude “Predator” or the garbled lo-fi samples at the end of “Boys,” the muscular melodic lines that emerged on Freedom and 2014’s Love still come through. That connection with the rest of McMahon’s music is welcome, because Death Jokes can be hard to parse, and would seem hammily provocative in the wrong light. It opens with a sample of a Woody Allen joke, and on the stunning, nine-minute penultimate track “Round the World,” essentially the final song before a track made entirely of samples, he sings about kids “getting stoned/On their phones/They’re so lonely and don’t know why.” But McMahon never seems like he’s tut-tutting or finger-wagging so much as appealing for forgiveness and generosity. On “Mary Anne,” a pastoral country ballad addressed to one of the women who sexually abused him as a child, he sounds compassionate (“In Purgatory, we both got lost/When we meet again, we will catch up love”) but terse (“I know you say who we are is the same/Well we aren’t the same.”) Other songs, like “Boys” and “Rugby Child,” are portraits of violent people driven by forces they can’t fully control. It doesn’t feel like McMahon is exalting victimhood, or condemning some vague concept of “cancel culture,” as much as trying to find shades of gray in an increasingly black-and-white world. He says as much on “Round the World,” a fraying epic that blooms from resolute pessimism about society’s failings into a song that’s maybe not hopeful, but at least helpful. Its lyrics—about greedy strivers and curious old friends and mystical piano geniuses—feel like they were written by an old-timer parked at the pub, offering their stories to anyone willing to listen. And as anyone who’s had their ears chewed by an old-timer at the pub knows, there’s generally a kernel of wisdom nestled among the cantankerousness. On “Round the World,” it’s a simple maxim for living out the end of your days: “Here’s to keeping it old fashioned/You can skip your next life/When it’s all gone, you’re gonna wish you had some old fashioned around.” Put it on your tombstone—wouldn’t that be a laugh?

Marina Allen,Eight Pointed Star,7.3,Folk/Country,"Marina Allen wields familiarity like a weapon. The Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter’s clear, quietly powerful voice sometimes recalls Carole King, sometimes Julia Holter, sometimes Maggie Rogers; her lush, Laurel Canyon-referencing production fits squarely within the ’70s folk-rock revival that’s been going on in Los Angeles for the better part of the last decade, epitomized by artists like Weyes Blood, Hand Habits, and Sam Burton. But for all the softness telegraphed in her music, Allen’s third album Eight Pointed Star is spiky and hard to pin down, its familiar environment camouflaging lyrics that can be vivid and fantastical. What other album uses the image of eating bones as a key metaphor on two separate tracks? “I eat the meat/I eat the bones,” on the rollicking country-rock song “Swinging Doors,” becomes a rousing cry of self-assuredness. On the airy, ambling “Red Cloud,” consumption becomes a way into Allen’s personal history; she makes “a stew with rain water and frozen meat, thick with pine needles, warm beer and baby teeth,” and wakes up “dizzy in Red Cloud,” the Nebraska town from which her family hails. The song’s lazy haze masks the intensity with which Allen tries to condense hundreds of years of history into a pop song, placing herself in the center of it: “I am tainted, I am taught, to be tough, to be raw, to be ruined, to be wrecked/Like the women whose aching backs and blistered skin make me coffee and burnt bread.” Beneath Allen’s laid-back compositions are lyrics that seem to scratch and claw at their seams in search of meaning. Allen’s lyrics have always been wordy—even the most accessible songs on her underrated 2022 album Centrifics, like the earwormy piano-bar tune “Or Else,” were written in long, knotty run-on sentences that stood at odds with the straightforward production. But the songs on Eight Pointed Star are more oblique and mystifying: They often take place in half-imagined, half-remembered places like the titular town in “Red Cloud” or the stretches of farmland Allen conjures on the fable-like “Bad Eye Opal.” Much of the album is ostensibly about Allen finding a sense of confidence—in art, in relationships, or in herself—and that confidence, true to the adage that the more you learn the less you know, results in songs that plant themselves firmly in life’s gray areas. Even so, Allen stumbles upon complex truths that she delivers with steely resolve. Opener “I’m the Same,” a piece of serene, spacious Americana, at first seems so placid that it’s unrecognizable as a breakup song. But that calmness feels in line with Allen’s rebukes to a partner, which are frank and cutting in their clarity: “Feeling wronged is not the same as proof,” she sings, delivering the line with the casualness of someone who knows they’re in the right. It’s a rare moment of certainty, and by the record’s last song, “Between Seasons,” all she’s sure of is that change can be a great thing. It feels like a mirror image of “I’m the Same”: Instead of chastising a partner for not seeing her fully, she revels in the feeling of growth. But the final line, once again, is a rug pull that suggests uncertainty can be one of life’s great joys, a quasi-mantra that reverberates through the rest of Eight Pointed Star: “Right on track, getting lost.” All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Illuminati Hotties,Power,7.5,Rock,"Criticizing bigwigs at the apex of the music industry seemed to come naturally to Illuminati Hotties. But after a few years of relative success as an artist and in-demand engineer, Sarah Tudzin’s spot might not look half bad to those still beneath her in the power structure, treading out of breath in Los Angeles’ sublevel swamp—and the perspective change is messing with her head. A musical Swiss Army knife, she spends her third album as Illuminati Hotties, Power, grappling with the complicated reality of where she’s at these days: basking in year one of marriage, smoking anxiously at The Met at dawn, and realizing her ADHD is productive until it isn’t. Never mind that her credentials earned her an impressive list of musicians on speed dial for Power—Death Cab for Cutie’s Jason McGerr, Jay Som’s Melina Duterte, Ryan Hemsworth—when she needs to sort through life’s mixed bag of humbling privileges and recent grievances before she can go back to taking shots. Engineering for Boygenius and Weyes Blood during the day and being a self-described “superhuman” musician by night, Tudzin’s relentless lifestyle could make you hyperventilate by proximity alone. “I triple-book my Saturdays, but I pretend my program keeps me from freaking out,” she sings, cross-eyed with stress, on the addictive lead single “Can’t Be Still.” On “The L,” Tudzin admits she can’t help the all-or-nothing grind: “I’m stubborn enough to give it up or give ’em hell.” Three years ago, that looked like cracking jokes and throwing uppercuts on Let Me Do One More to the tune of ricocheting power-pop. But with the gentler indie rock of Power, she forces herself to really, genuinely try to explore the middle ground between hiding under the covers all day and pulling wild all-nighters. Illuminati Hotties’ knack for earworms remains unshakeable, from the shoegaze-inflected guitars in “Throw (Life Raft)” to the lovesick vocal harmonies of “Sleeping In.” Accenturing those hooks are friends in the business: Cavetown joins her ode to giving up (“Didn’t”) and Speedy Ortiz’s Sadie Dupuis helps tackle mental white noise (“What’s the Fuzz”). Tudzin’s most effortless songwriting on Power, however, cozies up in a softer blend of acoustic guitar-led indie pop reminiscent of the early works of Tegan and Sara. Nursing wounds while simultaneously trying to put her problems to scale, Tudzin writes unpretentious songs that aim straight for the heart (“I Would Like, Still Love You,” “You Are Not Who You Were”) like the enduring hits of So Jealous. This is also the first collection of songs written after Tudzin’s mother died of cancer. While Power is not a grief album—“I’ll be writing that [one] for the rest of my life now,” Tudzin recently told Rolling Stone—she grapples with the heaviness of mourning frequently and candidly across Power’s tracklist. The doubletime ballads and slow strummers dedicated to her mother could have been paint-by-numbers dedications; instead, she flexes her strengths as a producer. As she sings from a place of resigned despair on “Rot,” Tudzin bolsters an otherwise straightforward acoustic number with percussion and cello. Come threadbare closer “Everything Changes,” she pushes the microphone against her lips so each word scratches through a raspy whisper. “I want to be where you are,” Tudzin quietly pleads to her mother on the title track, “I want to feel your power.” As the song’s drum machine beat and muted keys cast the orange glow of a sunrise, a sense of guiding momentum—faith, even—trickles in. Navigating the incalculable scope of grief is a lifelong task. On Power, Tudzin knows she’s in the early stages of trudging across it—that the sunshine doesn’t feel as bright as it used to, even if it’s reflecting off a pristine Grammy Award on her shelf. But god, when the angle hits just right and warms her skin, Tudzin notices small details developing into healthier habits: Googling how famous someone is, only to realize it doesn’t matter; letting her laughter spill out loudly; noticing that her wife likes sleeping in, so now she does, too. Learning how to balance the good with the bad is arguably the biggest key to surviving life’s hardest blows. Power doesn’t make it seem easy, but shows Tudzin trying anyway.

Porter Robinson,SMILE! :D,7.1,Electronic,"Porter Robinson thought he was ready to have fun. After the probing vulnerability of his 2021 album Nurture—wrung out after years spent trying to complicate the candy-painted sheen of his experiments with EDM—the North Carolina-raised musician set out to reconnect with the pleasure-seeking that informed his earliest work. His new album SMILE! :D is garishly nostalgic and unrepentantly joyous, full of maximalist synth leads that glimmer like a Blingee gif and tender-hearted vocal melodies that vibrate with the youthful abandon of songs overheard in suburban skate shops. On one level, it’s a cathartic release, a relieved exhale after a creative block that led to his last album. With a guest spot from the alt-pop pranksters in Frost Children and a torrent of silly stunts to promote the album’s singles, he signaled his goofy intentions. (At a pop-up event for “Kitsune Maison Freestyle,” he vibe-checked each fan that showed up and gave away clothing from his own closet.) But what’s actually in the songs is more complicated and emotionally raw than his reckless abandon implies. For the first time, Robinson reveals more of his sense of humor—“Bitch, I’m Taylor Swift,” he deadpans in “Knock Yourself Out XD”—but underneath the vivid colors and silly jokes, he’s wrestling with heavier themes. “Cheerleader,” though built around a synth lead as sickeningly sweet as the dust at the end of a roll of Smarties, grapples with the dynamics of parasocial relationships between fans and artists. Appreciative but anxious, lighthearted yet lacerating, the track’s tone is a tightrope walk made all the more dizzying by the confectionary rush of its instrumentation, which recalls both the impossibly glossy emo pop of late-aughts Warped Tour staples like Metro Station and the post-hyperpop experiments of singer-songwriters like glaive and aldn. Throughout, Robinson reflects on getting older and becoming an almost-pop star and ever more public figure. Even when he wraps his thoughts in colorful, caffeinated trappings, they hit hard. On “Year of the Cup,” he sings of a desperate, self-lacerating urge to be liked: “I can’t go to sleep/’Cause my mind keeps ringing with times that I laid out everything wrong with me up on stage/It’s embarrassing.” “Easier to Love You” mulls the loneliness of aging, finding disappointment in the distance between the person you are and the person you thought you might become. All the while, he favors arrangements as bright as he’s ever programmed: Tempos remain high, and chiming guitars float skyward in the mix. The energy is never more striking than on “Russian Roulette,” a peppily bittersweet song that grapples with career exhaustion and suicidal ideation—and takes a tongue-in-cheek swipe at an infamous joke review from Pitchfork’s early years—before ending with one of the most cutting moments on the whole album. After an emo-fueled chorus—“I wanna live/I don’t wanna die”—leads to a bouncy trance outro, a primitive computer-generated voice lectures about dance-music cliches (“The kick drum and bass suggests the song is coming to a close—that’s the format we’re used to”) before scolding, “Don’t kill yourself, you idiot.” Amid such stark contrasts in tone, the sudden vulnerability is strangely affecting. The split between effervescent sound and downcast mood is jarring. Robinson has been smiling through the pain at least since the loopy yet apocalyptic “Sad Machine,” but something feels different on SMILE! :D, as though he were under less pressure to make sense of the grand, sweeping emotions. He’s willing to be chaotic and a little all over the place, and though that does occasionally result in moments that are hard to process, Robinson proves that he’s as adept at wringing moving moments out of pop tropes as he is conjuring alien worlds.

Various Artists,harkening critters,7.4,,"In a 1954 speech, the influential environmentalist Rachel Carson advocated for a greater appreciation of the natural world, arguing that “the more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction.” Humanity may not have fully heeded her warning, but the record label Forms of Minutiae is trying to, using contact microphones, hydrophones, and radio receivers. Co-founders Pablo Diserens and Mathieu Bonnafous have released five ecology-based field recording projects in the past year alone, from Jean-Baptiste Geoffroy’s analysis of the French Loire River to Alëna Korolëva’s sound collage on extinction in the Toronto area. harkening critters, their latest, expands on this grandiose approach, recruiting 32 field recordists and sound artists for a four-hour compilation that draws our attention to the ways creatures of all sizes, from all corners of the globe, can speak to us. harkening critters’ overwhelming length aids in its mission; if you make it to the end, you might forget that it was stitched together by humans. Our four- (or eight-, or ten-)legged friends don a kind of audial horror vacui to prove just how grand they can get. “Buffalos in the Tallgrass Prairie (Oklahoma),” Félix Blume’s recording of bison in Oklahoma’s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, elicits the fear of prey meeting its predator. Rustling grass and short gusts of wind give way to the gigantic huffs and puffs of America’s national mammal, and their guttural, vibrating cries are a reminder of the bison's massive spiritual and tangible roles in shaping early Indigenous communities and their slaughtering by European settlers. KMRU’s “Inta” follows a collage of soundscapes from different Kenyan towns. Insects buzz and hum in typical KMRU fashion before other animals begin to pop in and out, crowding you from all directions, collapsing and combining into one another. Through our headphones, we are transported to their worlds on their terms, shrieks and clicks taking center stage. Throughout these recordings, you can hear traces of human life, and these, too, help reorient our relationships to animal habitats. Take the softly spoken French at the beginning of “L’arrivée de L’orage Dans La Région du Sertão,” or the distant playback of a folk track on “Temporal Deceleration.” In both instances, the human contributions sound tiny and peripheral within their bustling scenes; instead, the smaller organisms seem to have agency over the compositions. You can imagine an army of ants crowding around a DAW to drag and drop in these sparse moments of humanity, the inverse of how a singer-songwriter might throw grasshopper sounds behind their guitar riffs to evoke the natural world. While harkening critters revels in its formlessness, some of the album’s most exciting moments come from the little guys catching a groove. Katharina Schmidt’s “Havn” makes the murmurs of underwater organisms sound like quick kicks and snares off an IDM track; Murmer’s “χ​η​μ​ε​ι​ο​ρ​γ​α​ν​ο​ε​τ​ε​ρ​ό​τ​ρ​ο​φ​ε​ς φ​ω​ν​έ​ς” finds arpeggios in the gradual process of yeast fermentation; the natterjack toads on Raphael Malfliet’s “Natterjacks” croak against one another like a Gregorian canon; and Yoichi Kamimura’s ribbon seal calls on “Kyúai” evoke glides from a synthesizer. It’s refreshing to hear these organisms following their own patchy rhythms when centuries of formalized music tradition keep us hooked up to time signatures and metronomes. harkening critters is a staggeringly vast record not solely because of the many different organisms featured or the ways they vocalize their presence. One glance at the tracklist and you’re met with a handful of languages; one thorough listen and you hear a range of fidelities and frequencies. The overall effect is expansive, but inviting; the do-it-yourself approach encourages each of us to participate in our own close-listening activities. “Insect Nation Statement (Consensus),” submitted by Artificial Memory Trace, starts as a few gentle snaps and whistles and slowly crescendoes into a whirlwind of whirrs. The small insects sound cute individually but earth-shattering as a unit: a critter-created state coming into its own voice. Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from them and harness our individual listening experiences towards a common goal. Imagine us all picking up our devices and tapping into the sounds of nature around us—bearing witness to an infinite number of these ecological memoirs and prioritizing the kind of sensitivity Rachel Carson envisioned.",0,"October 9, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-harkening-critters/
Etelin,Patio User Manual,7.2,Electronic / Experimental,"For nearly two decades, Alex Cobb has been using synthesizers and field recordings to speak to some mysterious alchemy of mist and moonlight. Much of Cobb’s music seems like an attempt to fix landscapes in sound: His broad, graceful tones might suggest the flat expanse of the American Southwest, or pre-dawn light off Maine’s shoreline, or a fern-lined trail in the Columbia Gorge. But in recent years, the Ohio musician and proprietor of the labels Soda Gong and Students of Decay—formerly known as Taiga Remains and now working under the alias Etelin—has been looking closer to home. Cobb recorded 2018’s Hui Terra in stolen moments following the birth of his first child, channeling sounds to match the sleep-deprived psychedelia of new parenthood. Three years later, Frisson sank deeper into quotidian reverie, weaving the sounds of music boxes, kitchen clatter, a cooing toddler, and what might be a racketball game into his pleasantly aimless drifting. Now, on Patio User Manual, Cobb sharpens his focus on domestic rituals and rural spaces, imbuing evocative ambient sketches with the deep colors and abiding mystery of Gregory Crewdson’s enchanted backyards. “All Day Moon” drops us directly into the scene—chirping crickets, twittering birds, the declarative moo of a solitary cow—before Cobb brings up the faders on his synths. Soft, floaty pads strike an atmospheric note; the angled beam of a sharpened lead cuts horizontally, like the late afternoon sun. The whole album tends to linger in a similar mode: calm, bucolic, swirled with muted pastels. Timbres morph like slow-moving cirrus clouds; irregular patterns burble along without ever locking into mechanical repetition. The mood is contemplative but also blissfully Zen-like; subdued yet alert to a world of detail. It’s possible to detect a certain faint wistfulness, if you’re prone to such emotions, but Cobb’s limpid tone poems are never maudlin. Much of the album maintains a conversation with Etelin’s ambient forebears. The glassy bell tones and squiggling filters of “Brown’s Pool Behind the Hammock Tree” are reminiscent of Microstoria’s weird iridescence; the powdery textures and trebly feedback of “The Chemistry of Cobalt” recall Pole and Jan Jelinek. The organ and gentle new-age tones of “Golden Bells Hung From the Plants” might be a nod to Ernest Hood’s 1975 private-press album Neighborhoods, ambient music’s most definitive take on screen doors and lawn sprinklers. In a note accompanying the album, Cobb seems uneasy to submit too easily to the rhapsody of the back porch. “Is it actually possible to flee to the country when you’ve internalized a lifetime of intellectualized urban living?” he asks. “When you buy a DIY patio kit, you get instructions for how best to embed concrete or brick or flagstone into the natural world. The patio will make you enjoy your environment more. It will become yours. You can stand on it and think ‘this is Mine.’” It’s a healthily skeptical perspective, perhaps one that helps keep Patio User Manual from ever tipping into overt sentimentalism. But Cobb’s critical instincts never dim his enthusiasm for the mysteries of the world around him. In “The Chemistry of Dirt,” one of the album’s highlights, bursts of static establish a rapid-fire pulse against glowing chords; buzzing noises twist and bumble their way across the stereo field like beetles scuttling through the soil, their shells glinting against black loam. Beneath its muted surface, it’s a remarkably vivid and pictorial piece of music. It feels like a reminder that the patio is a gateway to realms seldom considered: Step beyond the edge of your suburban deck, and a hidden universe teems with life, right beneath your feet.",0,"August 27, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/etelin-patio-user-manual/
The Dare,What’s Wrong With New York?,6.2,Pop/R&B / Electronic,"The Dare’s mission is to bring back sleaze and sex, but so far his music has felt mostly like a LARP. The deliciously carnal “Girls” kickstarted Harrison Patrick Smith’s one-man electroclash revival, turning him overnight into a glossy magazine It Boy and a punching bag for critics exhausted by Dimes Square scenesters. But last year’s half-baked Sex EP failed to build on the hype. Now, after a bump in visibility for his production on Charli xcx’s tight and slinky “Guess,” the Dare’s debut album arrives in the form of a musical manifesto. The title, What’s Wrong With New York?, is a rhetorical question. The Dare, with his used-car-salesman blazer, thunderous bass, and horny dance-punk swagger, is here to rescue the city from its sexless pandemic slumber and Make New York Depraved Again. At 10 tracks, What’s Wrong With New York? doubles the Dare’s catalog while doubling down on everything that’s made his music so queasy. It’s even more redolent of LCD Soundsystem, but with a slimy, trashy edge; imagine James Murphy training as a pick-up artist. It oozes with desperation to sound edgy and cool like NYC rockers of myth. The Dare has spoken about wanting to bring back dissolution, to restore offensive fun to dance-rock. That could thrill if done right, and in certain electrifying moments, the Dare get close. But the album largely hits like a contact high, a simulation of a chaotic night out. It’s like BRAT for fashion consultants who brag about getting listed. What’s Wrong With New York? is split between typical Dare fare—libido-maxxed hooks, throaty groans—and hackneyed stabs at tender, post-bender profundity. He recycles the two best tracks from his EP, “Girls” and “Good Time,” which hurls voluptuous synth bass and garish hoots into a power surge of tipsy electricity. “Movement” cranks the adrenaline to peak monstrosity, like Fischerspooner’s “Emerge” rewired for body-bashing dancefloor freakouts. Highlight “I Destroyed Disco” is even more unforgiving, evoking Justice distorto-blare. It has some of Smith’s most hubristic lyrics—“I break records, glasses, faces, kick the whole world in the teeth with my untied laces”—but they work because he commits to the bit. Dark bass thuds like depth charge detonations and climaxes in a shockwave of bleeps. File under electro-crash. Most often, this music conjures only the vague sense that you might’ve heard it before, in a more striking rendition, by a more innovative band. “All Night” has catchy chants but it mostly feels like a lairy, drunken take on early MGMT. The insipid “You’re Invited”—in which he repeats “You’re invited” over a Rapture inspo beat—sounds like the tagline for the app that’s going to disrupt the private event industry. The video for the characterless “Perfume” indeed seems to be a fake commercial, packed with slender models in monochrome. What’s Wrong With New York? isn’t inventive or texturally weird enough to geek the analog synth heads, and its hooks aren’t massive or sticky enough to work as pure pop either. The embrace of pretentiousness and artifice comes at the expense of real emotional complexity and memorably witty writing. You can sort many of the lyrics into two categories: Gratingly winky come-ons—“I know it might be hard to swallow/But it’s much better once you get a taste” goes an especially repellent one—and sadboy poetry like, “Dreams die like a fantasy/I watch your life crash into me,” which might be more repellent. Songs ostensibly about sex and drunken havoc are devoid of tantalizing details: no coke-addled toilet fucking, no mind-shattering popper rushes, no unadvisable yet irresistible late-night encounters. What’s most frustrating is how rootless the music feels, like it could’ve been inspired by any city in the past 40 years. Particularly since it’s not like there’s a local or worldwide shortage of raunch right now—just look at the pop charts, or New York’s sexy drill scene. Keeping debauched decadence alive is a sweet idea. But the Dare’s most addictive song is still the one he made in an hour, as an off-the-cuff gag for his friends. His big-tent fantasy of downtown nightlife is one that’s been Xeroxed so many times it’s woefully diluted. What’s wrong with New York?

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,Wild God,8.0,Rock,"Back in 2018, a good 40 years into his musical career, Nick Cave made the leap from perennial theater attraction to arena-rock act. And while his promoters at AEG admitted at the time they were rolling the dice, the move was a key part of a masterplan to position Cave as the last alt-rock icon standing, filling the void left by Leonard Cohen, David Bowie, and Lou Reed. It was a lofty goal, to be sure, but in hindsight, they were actually selling Cave short: He’s really become something more like the goth Oprah. For Cave, music is just one part of a robust multimedia enterprise that spans books, films, speaking engagements, life coaching, and—the ultimate mark of personal-brand proliferation—his own homewares line. These days, Cave exists in an orbit of celebrity that would’ve seemed unfathomable even back when he was duetting with Kylie Minogue and writing screenplays for Guy Pearce flicks. There he is attending King Charles’ coronation. There he is taking songwriting tips from his pal Chris Martin. There he is gently grooving to “Glory Days” in the VIP section at a Springsteen concert alongside Chris Rock, Lars Ulrich, and Sting. At this point, Cave has become the rare musician who gets invited onto Colbert not to perform, but to sit on the couch and chat at length with the host. Cave hasn’t achieved this new stratum of fame by making his music more accessible—in fact, his body of work since 2013’s transitional Push the Sky Away encompasses the most unconventional, anti-rock gestures of his career, effectively transforming the Bad Seeds from his fearsome backing band to his impressionistic backdrop. Rather, Cave has broadened his reach by making himself more emotionally accessible. Since losing his teenage son Arthur to a tragic accident in 2015, Cave has transformed the process of grieving into a sort of ongoing interactive art project, guided by his candor and generosity of spirit. In his Red Hand Files newsletter, he counsels fans through their own hours of need; in concert, the once confrontational frontman now spends much of his time roaming through the audience or inviting them onstage, literally reaching out to his parishioners to elicit moments of physical connection and communal catharsis. But if Cave’s past decade has presented us with two parallel narratives—the crowd-pleasing showman vs. the tireless experimentalist—with Wild God, he conjures their point of intersection. Cave was originally going to title his 18th album with the Bad Seeds Joy, to reflect the more optimistic energy he was chasing after 2016’s bruised and brittle Skeleton Tree (recorded, if not written, in the immediate aftermath of Arthur’s death) and 2019’s otherworldly Ghosteen (whose ambient synth soliloquies were conceived as a means to communicate with his late son). But Cave ultimately decided that title would be too misleading. The shadow of death is no less pronounced on Wild God—since Ghosteen, Cave has unfathomably endured the death of a second son, Jethro, as well as the passing of former girlfriend/collaborator Anita Lane. But the way in which Cave processes his grief has changed, with the dream-state seance of Ghosteen replaced by morning-after reflection and a renewed appreciation for the staggering, at times irrational beauty of the world. Where many veteran artists’ careers can be clearly demarcated by phases, or charted by peaks and valleys, Cave’s has been more like a perpetually rolling snowball that now resembles an avalanche. His writing on Wild God is a hodgepodge accumulation of myriad obsessions and experiences: The Biblical bloodlust and wounded romanticism of old is now fully enmeshed with his more recent predilection for hazy-headed storytelling and random celebrity name-drops. (Miley Cyrus, say hello to Kris Kristofferson.) Likewise, the Bad Seeds have emerged from the fog of Ghosteen a changed band—while Wild God goes a long way toward reinstating their imposing sense of grandeur and groove (complemented here by Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood), the band now occupies a more celestial realm, embracing a style of symphonic space rock that evokes the alternately thrilling and terrifying sensation of sitting in an airplane as it lifts off the tarmac. Wild God was produced by Cave and his trusty multi-instrumentalist foil Warren Ellis, but they handed mixing duties over to Flaming Lips/Mercury Rev studio wiz Dave Fridmann. His cosmic console touch can be felt the instant the opening “Song of the Lake” appears in a confetti-cannon burst of choral vocals, wintry orchestration, and vibraphone chimes, as if this were the Bad Seeds’ very own Soft Bulletin. And surely it’s no coincidence that Wild God’s titanic title track namechecks “Jubilee Street,” the slow-burning Push the Sky Away centerpiece that swiftly became the transcendental highlight of every Bad Seeds concert. But “Wild God” is ultimately less an explicit sequel to “Jubilee Street” than an attempt to outdo it in the showstopper-sweepstakes department, summoning the gale-force voices of the Double R Collective choir for its cataclysmic climax. Wild God doesn’t so much capture Nick Cave fronting the Bad Seeds as losing himself within them. In accordance with the humbled soul we now see in interviews and online correspondence, Cave sounds absolutely in awe of the majestic sounds swirling around him. Forty years ago, he might’ve used the Cain-and-Abel parable and ominous storm-cloud imagery of “Frogs” as fodder for an apocalyptic blues-punk epic; here, they fuel a stargazing psychedelic-gospel odyssey that imagines Bowie covering “Nights in White Satin” for Blackstar. As the rain comes crashing down, Cave marvels at the toads jumping for joy in the gutter, and it’s easy to see why he’s so enamored with them: Much like the little froggies who’ve been reenergized by the downpour, Cave’s recent history has shown that even the darkest moments in life can have galvanizing effects. Wild God’s stirring centerpiece, the aptly titled “Conversion,” documents that process in real time: What begins as a doomy piano hymn erupts into a rousing church procession, with Cave practically speaking in tongues as he gets swept away by the choir. You just know that when he performs this live, he’ll be running up and down the aisles with arms outstretched, shouting “You’re beautiful!” in the face of every last attendee. But while these songs present rapture as an out-of-body-experience, they’re answered by equally arresting moments of Cave crashing back down to Earth and being forced to reckon with the cruel hand he’s been dealt, as if he were submitting a soul-searching Red Hand Files inquiry to himself. “I told my friends that life was good/That love would endure if it could,” he sings on the exquisite “Cinnamon Horses.” But the combination of Cave’s crestfallen tone and the song’s funereal atmosphere suggests there are moments he can’t so easily embrace his own life-affirming advice, and that the brave face he presents to the world is undergirded by intense self-doubt and sadness. And while the song that could’ve been this record’s title track, “Joy,” contains Wild God’s most readily quotable slogan—“We’ve all had too much sorrow, now is the time for joy”—the song itself never indulges that impulse in obviously ecstatic fashion. Singing an improvised first take over a somber piano blues, Cave recounts a late-night visit with the ghost of a teenage boy, his spectral aura manifest in the waves of wordless vocals wafting through the piece. In contrast to the suggestive emotional cue of its title, the overall effect of “Joy” is as haunted as it is healing, a musical expression of that uncanny feeling that overcomes you when you wake from a vivid dream about a dearly departed loved one. If the supernatural premise of “Joy” blurs the line between fact and fantasia, then the bittersweet “O Wow O Wow (How Wonderful She Is)” represents a more clear-eyed communion with the afterlife. The song is Wild God’s greatest outlier, and not just because of the programmed shuffle beats and Auto-Tuned smears. On an album that otherwise overwhelms you with IMAX-sized visions of dramatic weather events, untamed amphibians, and ghost teens, “O Wow O Wow” is Cave’s simple, sentimental tribute to a wild god who walked among us: Anita Lane, with whom Cave was creatively and romantically entwined at the dawn of the Bad Seeds. As elegies go, the song is surprisingly buoyant and even a little playful, thanks in large part to Lane herself, who turns up partway through in the form of a recorded phone conversation where she lovingly and laughingly reminisces about her early exploits with Cave, like a faded Polaroid that has flashed wondrously to life. At the start of the album, “Song of the Lake” sets the emotional tenor for Wild God with a line pulled straight from “Humpty Dumpty”: “All the king’s horses and all the king’s men/Couldn’t put us back together again,” Cave sings, and suddenly a nursery rhyme we’ve heard a thousand times takes on a whole new uncomfortable meaning, coming from a man who’s experienced a series of life-altering losses. Toward the album’s end, “O Wow O Wow” seems to provide a response: The pain of feeling broken is ultimately an affirmation that our late loved ones still live on within us. The day the hurting stops is the day they’re truly dead. Wild God reminds us that joy and sorrow aren’t mutually exclusive states, they’re more like adjoining rooms in a house; both the darkness and the light still bleed through the cracks in the doorway. Joy isn’t merely happiness felt, it’s happiness earned, and Wild God is a remarkable portrait of a man putting in the work required to cross the threshold.

Charly Bliss,Forever,7.8,Rock,"“One of the craziest things about getting older,” Charly Bliss singer Eva Hendricks has said, “is growing away from the things you did when you were young(er) and stupid(er).” Over the band’s past two albums and a handful of EPs, Hendricks has astutely chronicled those young, stupid experiences: falling in love with a jerk, getting dumped on your birthday, running yourself ragged with youthful ambition. Forever, the Brooklyn band’s third album, pulls off an impressive feat: In some of their biggest, most ambitious pop songs, they tap into those moments of emotional overload while infusing them with the sense of perspective that’s gained from growing up a little. On their first two albums, Charly Bliss balanced sweetness and angst, even as their sound turned from the tightly coiled pop-rock of their debut toward the moody, new-wave synth pop of its follow-up. Hendricks has often mentioned the Josie and the Pussycats soundtrack as a key inspiration, and there’s more than a little Letters to Cleo and the Breeders in Charly Bliss’ DNA. Forever doesn’t sacrifice grit but a bold, bright pop sound dominates. The serrated guitars of “I Don’t Know Anything” and “I’m Not Dead” are a throughline to the band’s indie-rock roots. But squint, and the sparkling “Back There Now” and slow-burning “Here Comes the Darkness” aren’t far off from Carly Rae Jepsen B-sides; the chorus of the explosive “Calling You Out” aims for stadium rafters. Hendricks’ self-examination, too, is heightened—and alongside self-incriminating songs about delusional crushes (“Tragic”) and picking senseless fights with your lover (“Calling You Out”), there are odes to the joys of new love (“Last First Kiss”) and even to the love shared among her bandmates (“Waiting For You”). Hendricks is perhaps funniest when singing about approaching adulthood while being a touring indie musician. On “I Don’t Know Anything,” she wonders what it means to sell out, about whether “as ’90s rock revivalists/We’re just too late.” It’s not exactly a ubiquitous problem, but she knows how to make it universal: When she sings, “You bet on yourself and you lose every day,” it might resonate with any strivers and dreamers staring down a potential global recession, not just the ones waiting on measly Spotify payouts. On the swaying “I’m Not Dead,” Hendricks sings jealously of her boyfriend’s septuagenarian dad: “His life’s more fun and more fulfilling than mine,” she sighs. “If I’m a rockstar, I’m not doing it right.” But she turns hopeful in the chorus, as the whole band cranks up a classic loud-quiet dynamic to cathartic effect. Maybe at the end, she’ll wish she’d “fucked up at least twice as much and had like double the fun”—but hey, as the song’s title argues, at least we’ve still got time. Despite dwelling in big feelings and sugar-rush choruses, these songs are dense and smartly constructed without being overwrought or self-serious. Even the ballads, which sometimes lose steam, boast moments of winking melodrama, like the Antonoff-esque saxophone bridge in “Nineteen.” On “Easy to Love You,” about the unbelievable good fortune of falling in love, Hendricks admits that “back and forth is an answer, too.” Perhaps that’s meant literally; she did move to Australia in early 2020 to test out a formerly long-distance relationship. But it’s also a fitting statement on an album that prizes both goofiness and growth, one that takes the long view of emotional vacillation without sacrificing forward momentum.

Alan Vega,Insurrection,7.8,Electronic,"Hell is real, Suicide often seemed to suggest, and it sounds like an anguished Elvis Presley gurgling for dear life, half-submerged in raucous, reverbed waters. For a good amount of his time on Earth, Alan Vega was drowning, too. Long before he was Suicide’s vocalist, he braved a bleak version of New York, sleeping on sidewalks and subsisting on one-dollar tuna sandwiches. He saw the potential of expression to pierce through his oft-barren reality—an itch that led him to the gallery, then the studio, then the No Wave circuit, then the nightmares of innocent concertgoers. (Come for the music, stay for the masochism: If you were lucky, the sharp object he used to slash his chest could have been your shattered wine glass!) As Alan Suicide, a short-lived moniker that preceded his musical career, he exhibited garish pile-ups of light bulbs and wires, like Rudolf Schwarzkogler pieces sans the corpse. The music he made as a solo act felt similar in effect: hazy hellscapes that combined styles like ’50s rockabilly and ’80s synth pop into concoctions that loomed in your head, often for reasons you couldn’t put a finger on. In the years since, it’s become much easier to locate that finger—maybe because his stuff sounds so familiar in retrospect. There are lines to be drawn between Suicide and a number of successors, be it Crystal Castles or Death Grips, but those connections, particularly with Vega’s late-career work, are rooted more in approach than attitude. He was an ideas person, like most denizens of the information era, and decades before SoundCloud, or Kim Gordon avant-rap albums, or distortion-happy hip-hop underclassmen, he gave shape to the impulse to combine those ideas as loudly, and unforgivingly, as possible. That’s what makes Insurrection, his newest posthumous release, such a thrilling listen: Here’s this guy who grew up on Elvis and the Stooges slurring strange, ghastly aphorisms over headbusting drum loops and fighter-jet ASMR. Relentless as it can be, it also sounds like he was having a blast. Since his death in 2016, Vega’s estate has bolstered a scattered catalog with more straightforward collections, their shared tumult less diluted by the happy-go-lucky attitude peppering his earliest efforts. Insurrection unearths 11 punishing, industrial lost recordings from the late ’90s, throwing his radiant vision and wretched reality into direct combat. More often than not, the reality is winning. There’s something both wrenching and invigorating about his gothic, moaned lamentations—“Oh, the angels bleed”; “Where is the light?”; “Oh, the words don’t exist”—on “Mercy,” a trench fight of a track with downbeats that blast like bombs. Vega was never so much a singer as a drawler; on songs like “Sewer” and “Murder One,” he’s rustling unnerving dictums, somewhere between streetside heckler and mythic doomsday prophet. Should you need any further proof that doomsday is now, the music here—co-produced by Jared Artaud and his widow, Liz Lamere—is a mammoth, earth-shaking messenger. Listening to Insurrection feels like being trapped in an insurgent wasteland, where arson fires scorch corpse-ridden backstreets and police helicopters whir overhead, searchlights blazing. The gurgling Elvis of Suicide fame is present on “Crash,” except instead of doggy-paddling through a sea of reverb, he’s writhing beneath a heap of scrapyard metal—clipping drums, blaring static, single keys that detonate like a dystopian funeral dirge. The one time the background noise settles, and for just one moment you can clearly make out what he’s saying, it’s “Who should we kill?” “Fireballer Fever” rattles like a lawnmower that chewed up a thousand wah pedals and went rogue; Vega isn’t controlling the beast so much as running from it, wailing in anguished, breathless desperation. Again, it’s difficult to parse what he’s saying, but that’s beside the point. The point is that you’re in fucking Hell. Vega’s Inferno is loud, clamorous, and largely homogenous, but in a bludgeoning, performance-art way. It feels like the sort of immersive war exhibit you have to sign a waiver for. Insurrection’s track titles invoke varying levels of death, torture, and superlative injustice: “Chains,” “Invasion,” “Cyanide Soul,” “Genocide.” Born into a brazen New York underworld, Vega spent his career taking evil, masticating it to its sonic rudiments, and spitting it back out, often directly in people’s faces. Half of experiencing his work is allowing yourself to suffer, to be under his control. This newest collection is an oppressive, nauseating roller-coaster ride. Once you get off, you’ll want to do it again.",0,"June 1, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/alan-vega-insurrection/
Broadcast,Spell Blanket - Collected Demos 2006 - 2009,8.5,Electronic,"In 1975, a time-traveling being from a distant but familiar realm left an indelible imprint on Trish Keenan’s mind. The titular character from Sky, one of a crop of bizarre British sci-fi shows supposedly made for children in the ’60s and ’70s, speaks with a cold, eerie affect, his voice warped slightly by tight echo. When exercising his telepathic powers, Sky stares down the barrel of the camera, his eyes and splayed palm imbued with a crude chroma-key glow. James Cargill, who formed Broadcast with Keenan in 1995, spoke of Sky’s deep influence on the band during a 2009 interview with XLR8R. He cited the show’s cocoon of white noise and paranoid, spectral atmosphere as key building blocks to Broadcast’s brand of retro-futurist psychedelia. In promotional photos, Keenan often emulated Sky, bathed in oversaturated colors and stretching her hand toward the viewer. She always seemed extemporal, as though her icy contralto and surrealist lyrics were beamed in from some far corner of time and space. When Keenan died of pneumonia in 2011, it was tragic not only for the sudden loss of a brilliant, exploratory musician, but because a portal to some other dimension had been permanently closed. On what would’ve been Keenan’s 43rd birthday, a mere eight months after her death, Cargill posted “The Song Before the Song Comes Out” to his SoundCloud page. The 40-second recording features an out-of-breath Keenan singing a quick tune, seemingly struck by inspiration in the middle of a walk. In the background, beneath a soft static buzz, you can hear her footsteps keeping time. The melody unspools gracefully, as if it’s a lullaby she’s known her whole life, the occasional fudged note a product of overthinking the intrinsic. Despite its brevity, the demo recording captures what made Broadcast so special: the hypnagogic interplay of childlike melodies and the noise surrounding them. In November of 2011, Cargill told The Guardian that he was constructing a new Broadcast record from Keenan’s massive trove of home recordings. It would be a monument to her preternatural talent, a fitting cap to the too-short Broadcast arc. That album never came, but for several years, Cargill kept a tradition of sharing one or two of Keenan’s demos on her birthday. It was a gift to perpetually heartbroken fans who trawled Soulseek and YouTube for any unheard scraps of the band’s particular magic. Over time, the links died and Cargill’s blog posts slowed to a trickle, but devoted heads doubled as archivists, preserving the songs on YouTube and Reddit. In 2022, Warp continued the fan service and deepened the band’s legacy by releasing Maida Vale Sessions, a selection of the band’s BBC studio recordings, along with reissues of two previously tour-only LPs, Mictotronics and Mother Is the Milky Way. Now, with Spell Blanket: Collected Demos 2006-2009, we finally get to hear what an album of new Broadcast material could have sounded like. It compiles 36 demos (including “The Song Before the Song Comes Out,” “Petal Alphabet,” and “Tunnel View,” all of which Cargill previously posted) into a warm and sprawling 65-minute tribute to Trish Keenan, providing an intimate look into her otherworldly genius. Spell Blanket is an expansive sonic feast, swiftly—but intentionally—oscillating from minute-long loop fragments and textural studies to more fleshed-out, properly arranged songs. There’s a noticeable flow in energy, which gives the collection more of a proper album feel than a mixtape or thrown-together compilation. “My Marble Eye,” a 32-second clip of pirouetting organ, leads directly into “Roses Red,” an unsettling three-minute pop song where guitar figures tumble around modal vocal melodies, a bed of feedback writhing like angry snakes in the background. The acid-dipped folk of “Fatherly Veil,” which features some of Keenan’s most ambitious and layered vocal work, sits between the quick tape-delay workout of “Tell Table” and the hard-panned drum-machine study of “Dream Power.” Quick cuts aren’t foreign territory for Broadcast; Spell Blanket’s collagist technique mirrors the scrapbook approach the band explored in its later releases. The stylistic swings can sometimes be jarring, but they ultimately illustrate the breadth of Keenan’s musical curiosity. At times, the naked vulnerability of these scratch recordings makes Spell Blanket a heart-wrenching listen. It’s overwhelming to hear such a torrent of Keenan’s music 15 years after what would be her final works. The chorus of “I Want to Be Fine” is gorgeous, a crushing shout of Sisyphean yearning catapulting over spare plucked guitar. She delivers the devastatingly simple line, “I want to be fine,” with her trademark stoicism, like a single tear rolling down a plastic mask. It’s hard to hear the occult sermon chant of “My Body” without feeling chills, as if we’ve walked into Keenan’s former bedroom with ghost-hunting equipment and received a clear transmission from beyond. Once the thrill of new Broadcast material subsides, the nagging recognition that we’ll never hear fleshed-out versions of these songs or know what she could’ve made next settles like a thick, immovable fog. Despite being a collection of demos, Spell Blanket feels like an appropriate conclusion to Broadcast’s discography—the final album they never got the chance to make. Among other things, it reveals that the group was a folk band at heart. The songs’ largely acoustic makeup takes away none of their power; it’s conceivable that they might even have embraced a more pastoral sound, had they continued. The band never stayed still, which Cargill lovingly confirmed in that Guardian interview: “We would've changed again. That was what I liked about doing [Broadcast]. We never got repetitive.” The bootlegged audio of their final shows in Australia hinted that the band was on the cusp of something new, as Trish’s looped vocals and Cargill’s cosmic synths felt distinct from anything they’d done previously; perhaps they were newly cognizant of the unconscious role shows like Sky and Children of the Stones played in their craft. As it is now, the Broadcast story is one of steady reduction, a band that pursued a specific idea and peeled away unnecessary layers in its service. Their records went from full-bodied, swinging ’60s psych to brittle, dying-battery synth pop, from a quintet to a duo to one person’s four-track tapes and MiniDiscs. The most prominent instrument on Spell Blanket is Trish Keenan’s beautiful voice, the steady center of Broadcast’s music, the key to its mystical appeal. We are lucky to have shared time and space with Trish; the door to her universe might now be closed, but Spell Blanket gives us one last generous peephole glimpse into its immense, singular beauty.

Laurie Anderson,Amelia,7.1,Experimental,"Laurie Anderson’s debut album, 1982’s Big Science, opens with a plane crash. Ever since, aircraft have figured inauspiciously in her work. The jets ominously crisscrossing “O Superman” (“Here come the planes/They’re American planes,” she intones) took on an even more portentous cast when she performed the song shortly after 9/11. In 2017, Anderson created a virtual reality installation, Aloft, that simulates sitting in a plane that slowly dissolves, leaving the viewer suspended in midair. At least some of these pieces may be drawn from Anderson’s own experience: She once survived the wreck of a small commercial plane. “It took a long time, ten minutes, from the time the first engine started sputtering to crash,” she recently recalled. “It sounds like nothing at all, ten minutes, and yet when you’re in a situation like that and you can’t move, it feels like the longest time imaginable.” Anderson’s new album Amelia plays similar tricks with time, but in reverse, compressing the last 44 days of Amelia Earhart’s life into a breezy 35 minutes. A fictionalized retelling of the pilot’s ill-fated 1937 attempt to circumnavigate the globe, it is, essentially, the chronicle of a crash foretold. From the very first engine noises that open the album, growling like a World War II dogfight, we know exactly how this story will end: with the 39-year-old adventurer, technologist, and feminist pioneer disappearing somewhere over the Pacific, never to be found. Like 2018’s Landfall—a rumination on the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in collaboration with the Kronos Quartet—Amelia pairs Anderson’s hypnotic style of vocalizing with a contemporary classical ensemble (Filharmonie Brno, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies). But Amelia, despite its tragic final act, is a lighter and livelier reflection: a celebration of Earhart’s life and spirit, and an occasionally awestruck meditation on the magnitude of her quest. Anderson uses multiple perspectives to tell Earhart’s story. Flatly objective logbook data bleed into fictionalized journal entries (“It was the sound of the motor I remember the most”). Telegrams (“Fred unable to set his chronometers. Stop. Personal unfitness. Stop. Looking bad for arrival in Oakland July 4th stop. Stop.”) alternate with third-person narration delivered with the coolly objective tone of an encyclopedia entry. Anderson uses different vocal styles and registers to accommodate these overlapping perspectives, while ANOHNI, singing through a vocoder, gives voice to the waves and the wind. These fragmented scenes suggest the kaleidoscopic perspective of a text like Michael Ondaatje’s Coming Through Slaughter, but in its brevity and gliding pace, Amelia feels more like a PBS special; you can practically see the red line moving across the animated map, the tastefully reenacted cockpit vignettes, the sleek montage of newspaper headlines and newsreel footage. Anderson has said that an earlier version of the piece was overstuffed with instruments and ideas, but Amelia flits briskly from scene to scene, with just enough musical backing to flesh out the atmosphere: shimmering oceanic drones; subtly driving pulses; dissonant whorls abruptly smoothed into reassuring consonance. A handful of guest musicians, including jazz guitarist Marc Ribot, flesh out Anderson’s impressionistic soundscapes, but they’re so carefully integrated into the whole that you might never notice their individual presence. Despite brief moments of tumult, it is a largely frictionless listen. Anderson has spoken of the way that Earhart’s story moved her, but neither the texts nor the music necessarily convey much of the pathos of Earhart’s life. There are many moments of wonder in Anderson’s imagistic array of sweeping deserts and glinting seas, and occasional flashes of dread (“Shipped the parachutes home today/Shouldn’t need them anymore... Not over the open ocean, where there’s no place to land”). But I rarely found myself having much idea of who Earhart was or how she felt. Perhaps that’s because I associate Anderson’s voice with a certain clinical distance, with the practiced irony of a song like Big Science’s “In the Air.” Even when giving voice to Earhart’s hardships—“So hot,” she complains, flying over the desert, repeating herself for emphasis—it feels less like a revealing internal monologue than a thought bubble in a graphic novel. The album occasionally hints at larger themes and more expansive vistas. When photographers call out “Lady Lindy!”—a reference to her rival aviator, Charles Lindbergh—she gripes, “I don’t even have my own name,” but that’s about as far as Anderson explores the feminist implications of Earhart’s story. Shortly thereafter, the perspective blows wide open, bookending the pilot’s introspective plea (“Where did I get this obsession to hurl myself against the sky?”) with quotations from Shakespeare (“Full fathom five thy father lies”) and Allen Ginsberg (“America, why are your libraries full of tears?”—a line that would not be written until 19 years after Earhart’s final flight). “What’s that sound?” Anderson asks, as though striking up a conversation with Ginsberg. “Everybody knows what’s going down. America…” For a tantalizing moment, we’re back on the familiar, ambitious turf of so many of Anderson’s works: the crumbling of empire, the curdling of the American dream, the warming planet and the rising seas. But it’s a fleeting impression, and we’re quickly whisked back to the final chapter of Earhart’s story: the failed rendezvous with the Coast Guard cutter Itasca and Earhart’s subsequent disappearance. As the pilot watches the shadow of her plane on the approaching water, Earhart’s final words are the same as those that open the album: “It was the sound of the motor I remember the most.” What follows is just the sound of lapping waves.

Mike Shabb,Sewaside III,7.4,Rap,"Mike Shabb has been a secret weapon in Montreal’s rap scene for years. Rather than turning out other staple sounds of the city—the danceable electro funk of Kaytranada or Planet Giza, the industrial and metal-tinged catharsis of Zambian transplant Backxwash—Shabb leans toward the new-age formalism of producer Nicholas Craven and rappers like Chung. He started out making trap around 2017, but he was also a fan of the classic boom-bap and airy, drumless loops that still define certain corners of underground hip-hop. After connecting with Griselda affiliate Craven, Shabb worked to refine his diverse sounds, dropping vibey turn-up joints like 2021’s Quarantine Flow and 2023’s Hood Olympics while doing ad hoc engineering for Boldy James and earning multiple beat placements on Westside Gunn’s 10. Shabb has an ear for beguiling samples and knows how to work them into beats spacious enough for scenery-chewers like Estee Nack to stomp through. After the handsome and stripped-back production of Sewaside II, which emphasized boasts, koans, and confessions told through his slick Montreal slur, he reaches higher and digs deeper on this year’s Sewaside III. The beats are stranger, the guest list is more packed, and there even seem to be live instruments in the mix. Shabb goes grander without trying to fix what isn’t broken, letting gnarled tendrils grow out of an already solid foundation. As a rapper, Shabb takes the lifestyle route, detailing his day-to-day in the 514. He isn’t concisely poetic like Boldy or a cartoonish bruiser like Gunn or Nack; depending on whether he’s slinging metaphors or simply storytelling, his croak of a voice oscillates between chill and despondent. Most of the time, he’s posted on the block and plotting out next moves while fear and regret linger in the margins. On “Grinchy,” where he’s masked up like MF DOOM and carrying a dog on him like Jim Carrey in How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a stray line sticks out from the warbling piano and betrays Shabb’s true feelings: “I keep my head high in situations I can’t cope.” That sentiment ripples under every moment on the album—from spliff tugs in the middle of shootouts where marks are running like Forrest Gump (“Free Cars”) to memorializing fallen friends and looking after their sons like Shep in Above the Rim (“Julie”). Fleeting moments of sadness prove that he’s only lowered the mask so much, and that intrigue keeps every vignette compelling. But outside of any deeper readings, Shabb is here to rap while expanding the boundaries of his production. Sewaside III’s beats shift from woozy, Conductor Williams-style dirges to lusher arrangements that will have you second-guessing whether these are samples or live-band interpolations. Some songs, like the spellbinding “Free YSL,” split the difference between competing strategies while Shabb and New Jersey rapper Da$h trade war stories and scars. There are meat-and-potatoes rap tracks like the Lord Sko-featuring “Milk Crate,” loose interludes like “We Live in Montreal” that add regional kick-back flair, and peppy hype tracks like “Ben Wallace”; Shabb approaches each with style and finesse. Thirteen of the album’s 17 songs are entirely self-produced. He’s ambitious, but not so self-absorbed that he takes himself too seriously, giving even the more ponderous tracks a breezy pace. Boasting the adventurousness and variety of a mixtape, Sewaside III is the most sprawling project in Shabb’s discography. On the penultimate track, “Free Jazz,” he yelps from inside a jazz-quartet whirlwind about the uncertainty of fame before a more sedate beat gives way to crooning about love and self-harm. It doesn’t quite have the focus and polish of his mentor Craven’s work, but he’s aiming for something bigger, more representative of his divergent tastes and thus slightly harder to categorize; he’s taking the hallmarks of traditional hip-hop and pushing them through filters attuned to Montreal’s cultural mix of jazz, dance, rap, and diasporic African influences. If this is what it sounds like for Mike Shabb to come into his own, he’s moving in the right direction.",0,"May 29, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mike-shabb-sewaside-iii/
Larry June ,Doing It for Me,5.8,Rap,"Has a rapper ever cared less than Larry June? For 15 years the San Francisco native has coasted on melodic G-funk beats—courtesy of either Cardo or one of Cardo’s many imitators—adorning them with autopilot rhymes and the most tedious ad-libs (“Oh my god!” “Goddamn!” “Good job, Larry!”) known to man. June cruises along on instinct, his casual affect reflecting his producers’ languid tempos. His penchant for luxuries great and small, Supras and smoothies, lends him something of an everyman quality, but even that’s contradicted by his insipid hustle-culture mantras. When he breaks into motivational platitudes (“Keep going, Larry!”), you find yourself bracing for an Herbalife pitch. Doing It for Me (who else would he be doing it for?) assembles the usual roster of A-list producers: Harry Fraud, Cookin Soul, and Jose Rios are all aboard. It’s some of the best music June’s compiled to date, further exposing his lackadaisical tendencies. “Magnum P.I.” weaves a fuzzy guitar, winding bassline, and purring synth into a lush, suggestive wash; June arrives in a Rolls-Royce sipping jasmine tea and clocks out in under two minutes. He’s here solely to fill space: “I’m all on FaceTime wit’ her, I’m kinda feelin’ this bitch/I love how that bitch talk, it’s so appealin’ and shit.” Anyone else would’ve considered this a reference track. Plenty of rappers owe their success to proximity, to being in the room whenever a great beat came on: Mack 10, Le$, any number of L.A. County weed-carriers who lucked into Battlecat tracks. (Jay Worthy can’t rap like Nas, but Nas doesn’t pick beats like Jay Worthy.) The job is to stay out of the way, and June has a rare talent for mucking things up. “Where I’m Going” and “Real Talk, Pt. 2” are aggravatingly simplistic, rhyming the same words for verses at a time. “Cleaning My Spot (Interlude)” is a three-minute humblebrag, June cataloging all the stuff in his house he has to dust. His bulleted diaries are static and repetitive, evoking uncanny solitude: He skims bank statements, sends a few texts, checks his oil gauge, and drinks orange juice. There isn’t a single guest across Doing It for Me’s 15 tracks—June has a house full of toys, and no one to play with. If he’s a lone wolf on record, June’s vacation-rap philosophy has been embraced by a growing cohort of rappers spanning the Gulf Coast through Texas and points west. Layering ’80s soul samples with 808 drums and semi-improvised lifestyle bars, they’re prone to stock imagery: palm trees, turn-of-the-century imports, and Diamond Collection sportswear. Producers Tavaras Jordan and DJ Mr. Rogers are disciples of Houston legend DJ Screw, adapting the woozy tempos and verse-hook structures of his ’90s work. But the movement’s origins date to 2004, when Lil Wayne boasted he was done writing rhymes—to hear him tell it, everything from Tha Carter on was a glorified freestyle. His protégé Curren$y seized the baton with an assembly-line approach, churning out low-overhead projects credited to individual producers, often just weeks apart. The lesson, for June’s closest peers—Dallas’ AJ Snow, St. Louis’ Dom Venice, Georgia’s Monroe Flow, L.A.’s Niko G4—was that smooth beats and intuitive style could compensate for low-energy performance and barely-there lyrics. It’s prescriptive mood music, and at its best Doing It for Me models an unpretentious sense of purpose. The romantic instrumentals of “Breakfast in Gold Coast” are like waking up in silk sheets, and “Imported Couches” has a string arrangement Lenny Williams would kill for. June abandons rapping entirely on “Stinson Beach,” transforming into a ’70s soul man over the track’s punchy horns. It’s a brilliant deployment of his gravelly voice, reminiscent of Z-Ro’s forays into quiet storm, and the change of clothes does wonders. Doing It for Me may prove a transitional record given June’s experiments with melody, but his faux pas are glaring in light of such magnificent production. Even the ballads are banal and acquisitive, delivered with the same thousand-yard stare as June’s paeans to cars and fruit juice. Ostensibly a love song, “A Little While” is the shuffling declaration of a sheepish prom date: “When we first started talkin’, it was easy and shit/Finally found somebody I like, I was thankful and shit.” All this macking and stacking should come with some sort of payoff, but it’s always more chores and traffic. You can’t help but imagine what a more dynamic artist would’ve done with these arrangements, because the worst part of a Larry June song is inevitably Larry June.",0,"August 9, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/larry-june-doing-it-for-me/
Young Jesus,The Fool,7.8,Rock,"Here’s an incomplete cast of characters that populate The Fool, Young Jesus’ provocative seventh album: a pair of washed-up outlaws, an elderly man entirely reliant on his children, a doctor who gets caught creeping on his patient’s social media, and, on “MOTY,” a menagerie of garden variety misogynists, hypocrites, and insecure momma’s boys fronting as alpha males. Oh, and the person who gets lost in their memories of being abused as a child and comes to, decades later, standing over a dog they’ve just beaten. Yet, the most unnerving characters are the ones John Rossiter allows us to believe are himself—artists who’ve witnessed the life-saving powers of art firsthand and seen it curdle into condescension, delusions of grandeur, and revulsion towards the people most like him. While Rossiter hasn’t confirmed whether any of The Fool is autobiographical, it’s an unsparing, indelible product of a man who had to question every one of his artistic motivations before making the most vital album of his life. Rossiter’s interrogative approach—to pop music, to literature, gender norms, to the social contract, to truth itself—serves as the connective tissue throughout Young Jesus’ fascinating discography, which has earned legitimate comparisons to the Hold Steady, Talk Talk, and Albert Ayler. But there’s also the one remnant of Rossiter’s formative era as a hard-drinking Midwestern garage rocker: the impulse to blow everything up on the verge of a conventional success. After 2015’s Grow/Decompose brought Young Jesus’ initial phase as Chicagoland barstool bards to a wider audience, Rossiter moved to Los Angeles and did what transplants do: experimented with spirituality, got into free jazz, and started book clubs. A trilogy of exploratory albums followed, each one tantalizingly close to a masterpiece. But due to burnout—or just the sense that Young Jesus’ incarnation as a post-rock jam band had become its own kind of formula—Rossiter disbanded the group and released the stripped-down Shepherd Head; like all Young Jesus albums, it felt transitional, but this was the first time that Rossiter lacked conviction in his direction. The Fool does not have that problem. The opening duo of “Brenda & Diane” and “Two Brothers” brings Young Jesus back to their roots—gleaming acoustic strums and brassy synth washes, a gruff guy singing imperiously of the downtrodden trying to protect their dignity, the sort of things that gets called “heartland rock” in 2024; surely someone as studious as Rossiter recognizes the evocative nature of their respective titles. Whereas most of Young Jesus’ work on Saddle Creek trafficked in dialectics, arcane philosophical tracts, and 15-minute jam sessions, The Fool gets right to the point, with Rossiter putting his trust in direct statements—“True love is a little bit like hell,” the goddamn American Dream, concepts dismissed as cliche until time and experience reveals their enduring truth. Towards the end of “Two Brothers,” Rossiter meets a humble gardener who works the Earth to get closer to God, which would’ve been too pat of a literary device had Rossiter not temporarily quit music to study permaculture. Even as The Fool shapeshifts into meditative jazz-pop, torch song, and frisky folk-rock, there isn’t a second of passive listening to be had; Rossiter and his new cast of collaborators confront and engage the listener as if their undivided attention essential to keeping the unorthodox mix from collapsing on itself. He might not be the most technically proficient singer, but Rossiter’s fearless—no tonal or emotional register is out of his range. To accurately express the decade's worth of thwarted desires packed in the chorus of “Rabbit,” you don’t hit the notes, they need to be smashed to bits. On “Sunrise,” Rossiter plays the role of a singer who believes they communicate directly with God, but not so far gone they lose their sense of humor—“Don’t think I take it light/Yeah I bought some new pants!” In the rare times when Rossiter takes on a more subdued tone, the mix is riddled with found sound, bursts of noise, and curious harmonies that all hit like a sudden burst of cortisol from the shame of pressing an accidental “like” or experiencing the first pangs of a vulnerability hangover. “Rich” is that very feeling extended to about six minutes. The narrator is the product of ill-gotten gains that have produced lawyers, schizophrenics, bankers, anorexics, active and sober addicts, completed suicides and four others that “tried, but we didn’t get far.” And now, an artist who sees far too many white guys just like him, overcompensating for their privilege and competing for “the purest of all.” Calling out the hypocrisy of indie rock trust funders isn’t brave on its own, but “Rich” calls into question why and if these conversations are even worth having—does generational wealth create generational trauma? Why is it assumed to preclude the ability to make great art? Is the glorification of poverty a subtle form of condescension? “And the worst of it all is that art saved my life,” Rossiter intones during the final verse, where his voice eventually undergoes an Irishman-style de-aging to bring them back to the time they bought their first guitar and deviated from the path of McKinsey internships, law school, feckless philanthropy, and everything else that makes the rich a different kind of miserable than everyone else. The thorniest question posed by The Fool is why I’d expect, or even want “Rich” or “Dancer” to be explicitly about Rossiter. Even if that would require him owning some embarrassing truths, it would actually work to Young Jesus’ benefit, placing The Fool in a lineage of indie rock lifers making a mid-career transition to full disclosure and achieving new heights of respect and acclaim. But this is yet another impulse that Rossiter has challenged—“Wanted to write about the bad men that I’ve known,” he moans during “Am I the Only One,” before he questions whether this would be just another way to reinforce his own self-image. Too often, “therapeutic” and “confessional” music is viewed as praiseworthy by default, where the unburdening of one’s own flaws is an end unto itself rather than a means of shedding ego and shame to foster connection. When the recurring character of Eloise sees a ping from her Instagram page, she doesn’t screenshot it to shame her doctor; she thinks of her father and her brother and the loneliness that moves them to scroll through a stranger’s pictures. “MOTY” (i.e., “Man of the Year”) starts cynically, in judgment of Great Men, and ends with Rossiter finding strength in the presence of the good men in his immediate circle. Perhaps the most daring song Young Jesus wrote during this process could’ve offered a more tidy first-person narrative had it made the final tracklist. “Another album in the books,” Rossiter sings on the B-side to “Brenda & Diane,” acknowledging up front how this one might be received differently than his previous six—“to Mom and Dad: I know it hurts.” It’s called “Hollywood Ending,” a title that bears more weight given Rossiter’s experience writing for television. Instead, we got The Fool, an album that offers its emotional reckoning as a messy and necessary new beginning for Young Jesus.

Good Looks,Lived Here for a While,7.5,Rock,"It’s rough out there for lots of indie rock bands, but Austin’s Good Looks have really been through the shit. The day after they released their 2022 debut, Bummer Year, guitarist Jake Ames was nearly killed in a hit-and-run. The band put off touring while he slowly recovered, and when they did finally hit the road, their van caught fire and they lost everything: gear, instruments, laptops, merch, personal effects, everything. A less committed group might have taken either of these tragedies as a sign from the universe, but to their credit Good Looks are a foolhardy lot. While they don’t address those trials on their follow-up, Lived Here for a While, they play like their lives depend on it. Lived Here for a While views the world from a blazing tour van. These songs aren’t just about what they see out on the road, but what they leave behind. Lovers grow distant, friends fade away, cities expand beyond recognition. “This used to be a Black neighborhood,” frontman Tyler Jordan exclaims on “White Out”, and few songwriters could make gentrification sound so deftly (or wittily: “Look out! They’re jogging! and they’re bringing their dogs with ’em!”). Whenever they tour, they never return to exactly where they left, which churns up a sense of unease in these songs: The tempos are just a little too fast; the guitars bypass jangle and head straight for the jitters. Too often, indie self-awareness can come across as self-regarding and off-putting, like a novel about how hard it is to be a novelist. How many listeners can relate to tales of long hauls and empty venues? To their credit, Good Looks never whine about their fortunes, nor do they sound like they’re playing exclusively to other touring indie rock bands. Jordan makes it all relatable, as though touring were no different than any other low-paying gig in late-capitalist America. And he knows that lovers and spouses typically take the brunt of any artist’s frustrations. Jordan is an ambitious songwriter—and occasionally a messy one, as on “Self-destructor,” which lapses into condescension—but songs like “If It’s Gone” and especially “Desert” are distinguished by their generosity toward their subjects. Jordan apologizes rather than throws blame, and hopes it’ll make him a better man. As he sings on “Vaughn,” “Not every single lover has gotta be a sad song.” Jordan was singing about these subjects on Bummer Year, but these new songs are more acute in their angst, more vivid in their arrangements, more volatile in their performances. As resourceful a songwriter as Jordan may be—with a casual lyricism that can turn a plainspoken phrase into a lighter-raising chorus—Good Looks were never merely his backing band. Racing through “Self-destructor” and churning up drama in “Why Don’t You Believe Me?,” they take the curves a little too fast, but the rhythm section’s taut krautrock beats keep all tires on the pavement. And Ames always has a punchy riff on hard, or a trenchant guitar tone, or a blast of feedback to bolster Jordan’s vocals or wryly undercut him. Self-referential yet also self-critical, they play every song like it’s an argument for why they’re playing that song. There’s a sharp desperation to Good Looks’ headlong heartland rock, as though they might be trying to outrun something. “I keep driving around, to try to make some strangers love me,” Jordan sings on “Can You See Me Tonight?,” and the line perfectly sums up the Sisyphean life of a touring band. Then he adds the kicker: “By the end of tonight, I’ll sing myself hoarse and I’ll still feel empty.” Without romanticizing their lives, they do manage to find something meaningful in that pursuit, even if it’s just another song to stave off the darkness. Correction: A previous version of this review included a line about the song “Self-destructor” that could be misinterpreted. This has been amended.",0,"June 12, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/good-looks-lived-here-for-a-while/
Johnny Foreigner,How to Be Hopeful,7.8,Rock,"Johnny Foreigner are not an optimist’s punk band. Listening to one of their songs feels like glimpsing the galaxy of bad decisions that led you to the present: the party where you had one too many drinks, the people you alienated when you revealed too much of your personality, the city you moved away from when you felt you had finally wrung all possibility out of both it and yourself, and especially the music you listened to while all these life-altering events occurred—music that, as much as it seemed to make sense of what happened to you, was made by people as hopeless and confused as you were. So it’s ironic that How to Be Hopeful, the first Johnny Foreigner album in eight years, does its best to unironically live up to its title, to offer up a hope steeped in realism, one that includes the inevitabilities of disappointment and regret, one that knows that life is a fitfully boring/exciting/terrifying/depressing movie that resists any narrative convention. “It gets worse!” is how the record opens, guitars wavering behind Alexei Berrow’s bark as if they woke up still drunk. It’s the kind of hangover that feels nostalgic, like a warm hug from a former self. What’s made Johnny Foreigner novel up to this point is their sense of scale. Songs are never just songs; they’re portals to memories recent or remote, to feelings one’s nearly forgotten they ever had. People are never just people: They’re tornadoes of context, and they don’t move through your life without altering it forever. A night out is never just a night out, when in the silence between drinks you can’t help but think of every mistake you ever made, and how you probably couldn’t have avoided any of them. There’s romance in failure, truth in mythology. Nothing is ever just itself. All of that scale is restored on How to Be Hopeful, but a new dimension’s been added: love. This is the first Johnny Foreigner record with actual, earnest love songs. Previously falling in love guaranteed its bitter end, or else was unrealized, unrequited, converted from present to past as soon as it was recognized. Here, songs like “What the Alexei” are disarmingly, charmingly smitten. “I’ve been collecting data,” Berrow sings, “and every time you smile stars grow brighter/Your gravity/A super collider.” You can hear a genuine smile behind Berrow’s voice. It might be the cutest Johnny Foreigner song, even as the second verse inevitably turns its attentions to another song, with Berrow interrogating Travis Morrison’s pose of self-involved heartache in the Dismemberment Plan’s “The Ice of Boston” (“Oh Travis/Boy I love you/But hey/Get a life!”). One might’ve expected them to sober up and slow down for this shift in subject matter, but musically they remain Johnny Foreigner, as if every variant of emo-punk from Sunny Day Real Estate to Blink-182 were shrunk into a orb of space trash falling through the atmosphere at a million miles per hour. (They even quote Blink on “The Blazing World,” when bassist Kelly Parker sings, “And that’s about the time I walked away from him,” and Berrow asks, “Get it?”) Drums shatter through the songs like bottles across concrete, guitars come on bright and immediate as the knife-edged clarity of the morning after. “Museum of Useless Things” is their best bid yet for the world’s fastest fake American Football song—the notes in the chorus glow like light pouring through pinholes. However they’ve neglected to innovate or explode their sound since 2011’s Johnny Foreigner vs. Everything—their best album, where bristling punk songs, piano ballads, crackling electronic pieces, and spoken-word interludes formed an interconnected universe of heartbreak and disappointment. Innovation, especially in a genre as often static as punk, seems beside the point now. Now the point is survival. How to Be Hopeful was recorded after Johnny Foreigner went on a few-year hiatus during the pandemic, and the prevailing mood of the record seems to be gratitude that it exists at all. “It gets better!” is how they begin the last song, “We Build This City,” and yet it doesn’t seem to contradict how the record opened. It gets better and worse. You lose more friends than you thought you would. You live long enough to realize that you know nothing, that you’ll never be adequately prepared for what’s coming. You learn that a “career” will spit you out as quickly as it inhaled you. But seeing someone laugh at your dumb joke still makes your heart flutter a little. Watching fireworks explode over the water still looks like new galaxies forming. And the next song you hear could still be the best song you’ve ever heard. “Whatever comes next/All pretty sunsets/I’d like that,” Berrow sings as the record closes. The image isn’t quite complete until the next line: “A perfect soundtrack.”",0,"September 23, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/johnny-foreigner-how-to-be-hopeful/
Redd Kross,Redd Kross,7.8,Rock,"If there’s one thing Redd Kross are famous for, it’s having famous fans. Years before Sonic Youth made Madonna their own, brothers Jeff and Steve McDonald were showing Kim and Thurston how pop culture pin-ups could be reframed as punk iconography. They got Sofia Coppola to pose nude on an album cover and inspired her brother Roman to essentially build a feature film around their kitschy ’70s style. They illuminated the path for Stone Temple Pilots to move beyond mosh-pit machismo toward glammy swagger. They reissued their ’90s catalog through Jack White’s Third Man imprint. And Jeff married a Go-Go. There is, however, one notable alt-rock star who resisted Redd Kross’ charm offensive. You’d think Redd Kross would’ve been right up Kurt Cobain’s alley: Both he and the McDonalds came of age with record collections where the Beatles were filed next to Black Flag, and both were charter members of the American Shonen Knife fan club. But according to mutual friend Dale Crover (the one guy who’s drummed for both Nirvana and Redd Kross), an unimpressed Cobain walked away from a 1987 Redd Kross gig in Tacoma complaining that the McDonalds seemed “too happy.” After seeing Crover tell that story in an early cut of director Andrew Reich’s new Redd Kross documentary, Born Innocent, Steve McDonald wrote “Way Too Happy,” a bittersweet power-pop number that appears deep into Redd Kross’ new self-titled double album. “What did he mean?” Steve asks with audibly wounded pride, before responding with an uncannily Cobain-esque sneer, as if he were still being taunted from beyond the grave. But the McDonalds aren’t looking to reheat old beef—rather, “Way Too Happy” serves as a renewed mission statement for a band that has always embraced joy as its superpower. As indie rock’s original poptimists, Redd Kross elevated fandom to an artform, imagining a world where ABBA and the Partridge Family could be placed on equal footing with Germs and the Stooges. But after decades of plundering rock’n’roll’s past like a thrift-store discount rack, Redd Kross are now fixing their retro-gazing lens on themselves. Redd Kross is part of a 45th-anniversary celebration campaign that includes Reich’s documentary and an upcoming memoir (Now You’re One of Us), and it’s a self-reflexive exercise in every way, from the cover art (a ruby-tinged makeover of the Beatles’ White Album, the first record Jeff bought as a kid) to the uncharacteristically wistful, introspective songwriting. But seeing as Redd Kross are the rare band who can celebrate 45 years in showbiz while one founding member is still in their 50s, the eternally youthful McDonalds are still committed to chasing new glories. They may no longer resemble the androgynous provocateurs of old, but their pop savvy remains. Redd Kross provides a thorough immersion in the McDonalds’ multi-dimensional sound world, giving equal airtime to sleazy rockers (“Stunt Queen”), glamtastic power ballads (“The Witches Stand”), and jaunty pop numbers that sound like the theme song to some saucy late-’60s British sex farce (“The Shaman’s Disappearing Robe”). While the White Album framework may suggest an anarchic, free-ranging pastiche, Redd Kross aren’t radically reinventing themselves here: Listening to the record feels more like rifling through a cherished collection of classic 45s. Recorded in collaboration with ex-Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer (who produces and plays drums for a recuperating Crover here), Redd Kross is a hit parade that perpetually walks the tightrope between the McDonalds’ pristine melodic craft and their innate garage-band insolence. Even when limiting themselves to pop-single proportions, Redd Kross can traverse entire universes. A rare duet between the brothers, “The Main Attraction,” begins as an existential acoustic lament before hotwiring their voices together and using their natural harmonic power to launch the song into space. If Redd Kross are the definition of a cult act, then “Good Times Propaganda Band” is their indoctrination theme, a tiki-lounge psych-pop excursion that suddenly drifts into KISS pyrotechnics. And in just over two minutes, the softcore porn-inspired “Emanuelle Insane” uses a backward loop of Redd Kross’ 1981 circle-pit standard “Annette’s Got the Hits” to forge an unholy alliance between groovy ’60s sitar-psych and brooding ’80s post-punk. But Redd Kross is ultimately a testament to what one song refers to as the “Simple Magic”: “Three sacred chords,” Jeff sings, “Their power shouldn’t be ignored!” And so the McDonalds spend the bulk of Redd Kross kicking out the jangly jams with the effortless expediency of the Beatles if they cut their teeth in the late-’70s L.A. hardcore scene. (AI technology will do no better job of recreating the voice of John Lennon than Jeff McDonald does on the rousing “What’s In It for You?”) But Redd Kross spikes the McDonalds’ well-worn cheeky attitude with a healthy dose of sincere gratitude, particularly on the album’s closing autobiographical anthem “Born Innocent.” An origin-story myth set to windmilling Pete Townshend riffs, the song suggests that if the brothers aren’t satisfied with the documentary and memoir, they already have the anchor track for a Redd Kross jukebox musical. “Born Innocent” is, of course, named after Redd Kross’ 1982 debut, an ironically titled document of corrupted youth that opened with a song about a former child star busted for cocaine possession. As the Born Innocent documentary illustrates, the McDonalds have endured a lot of crazy shit that could irreparably break less sanguine spirits, from a 13-year-old Steve being abducted by a woman nearly twice his age, to Jeff’s substance abuse in the ’80s, to their band’s chronic commercial misfortune. But on Redd Kross, the McDonalds are still very much those Hawthorne kids getting their minds blown with each flip on the turntable, forever gazing at the Paul McCartney and Paul Stanley posters in their bedrooms and dreaming of one day hanging alongside them. “We are all born innocent,” the McDonalds declare in unison, and after nearly a half-century of making music together, they’ve magically managed to stay that way.

Wadada Leo Smith,"Central Park’s Mosaics of Reservoir, Lake, Paths and Gardens",7.4,Jazz,"Central Park sits like a monster’s footprint in the middle of Manhattan, girdled with towers, lush and verdant but hard to mistake for the wilderness. Such an imposing work of infrastructure appeals to Wadada Leo Smith. The great AACM trumpeter and composer’s releases since 2012’s Ten Freedom Summers encompass an alternative map of America, lovingly sketching in its Great Lakes and National Parks while honoring its civil rights leaders, artistic geniuses, and the millions displaced and killed in its creation. Smith composed six of the seven pieces on Central Park’s Mosaics of Reservoir, Lake, Paths and Gardens, and he’s joined by pianist and AACM cohort Amina Claudine Myers, who completed the sessions with no prior rehearsal. Smith describes Central Park as his favorite park in the world, but from the first minor-key piano notes on “Conservatory Gardens,” it’s clear that Mosaics is about more than bucolic landscapes. The tone is stately and almost elegiac throughout, as if a grand, seismic, and vaguely frightening event is taking place on a glacial timescale. Myers broods in the lower octaves, providing the bedrock through which Smith’s horn cuts like a river through the landscape—or like a path through a garden, or like the park itself through Manhattan’s skyscraper canyons. It’s a delight when her hands dance freely into the higher registers, as in the last minute of her splendid solo piano piece “When Was,” but she and Smith largely proceed at a deliberate pace. It could work as ambient music if Smith’s sharp tone did not so thoroughly dominate the mix; its first appearance on “Conservatory Gardens” after more than a minute of insinuating piano intervals from Myers comes as an abrupt shock on an initial listen. Mosaics is as interested in the park’s human history as its natural beauty. One of the longest and most beautiful pieces on the relatively short record is “Albert Ayler, a meditation in light,” in which the spirit of the late free-jazz icon apparently inspired the loosest and most convivial interplay between the two. “Imagine, a mosaic for John Lennon” is (thankfully) not a rendition of “Imagine” but an extension of the album’s air of twinkling mystery. The spot near Central Park where Lennon died is a popular site of pilgrimage for Beatles fans; the album’s somber tone suggests an awareness of the millions of lives and deaths that make up New York’s past, the sheer density of human history one can feel in every square inch of the city. In its exploration of a relatively small part of NYC as a microcosm of its complexities, Smith and Myers’ album is spiritual kin to Loren Connors’ stunning solo guitar albums Hell’s Kitchen Park and 9th Avenue, which channeled the vanishing Irish-American history of the gentrifying Manhattan neighborhood of Hell’s Kitchen. Like those albums, Mosaics is short, just 36 minutes, more than a quarter of them occupied by “Conservatory Gardens.” But it doesn’t feel small, even when compared to Smith’s almost improbably ambitious epics like the four-and-a-half-hour Pulitzer nominee Ten Freedom Summers.

Robber Robber,Wild Guess,7.3,Rock,"Tell a teenager that their 20s are for “living,” and they might envision flashy movie montages: rooftop parties, sloppy smooches, city lights whizzing by through back windows. Tell the same thing to that same person once they’ve actually reached the age, and they may sigh. Fleeting youth must fight fledgling adulthood at some point—just ask Robber Robber. Since co-founders Nina Cates and Zack James ditched Brattleboro for big-city Burlington, they’ve taken to pitting airy dreamscapes against raw realities, scoring the havoc with searing, expansive indie-rock stompers. On Wild Guess, the Vermont four-piece’s debut album, the carnage is supercharged: Rough-edged songs melt into soupy squalls, with alien truths nestled in heaps of amorphous noise. It’s hectic, bumpy, and full of treasures that reveal themselves over time. It sounds a lot like what growing up feels like. Robber Robber tread a thin line between hearty indie and rough-edged post-punk, melding the former’s airiness with the latter’s angst. Back in the 2010s, teenaged Cates and James played in a short-lived group called the Snaz, in which off-kilter garage rock buttressed precocious tales of teenage girlhood. Since their departure, the two have made notable additions to their sound—among them, guitarist Will Krulak and bassist Carney Hemler—though Wild Guess confirms they haven’t left any of their scrappy bite in those small-town rehearsal rooms. Perched somewhere above the havoc, Cates wanders through hypnotic epics with an aloof hush, like Trish Keenan testing microphones in the middle of a crowded Guitar Center. Perhaps the best example is “Seven Houses,” a torrential onslaught of downpicking, cymbal crashes, and bass fills that grumble like a starving Godzilla’s gut; for all its tension, there’s respite in her delivery, a wispy narrator frolicking in a bad dream. In the final minute of “Until,” a charming guitar ballad that bridges Crazy for You and Pod, Cates drawls, “Hold on,” until all that remains is a single sickly string obeying her directive to the bitter, distorted end. It’s one of several moments where you feel like you’re in the room with them. The longer you sit with Wild Guess, the more it might seem to exist in a funhouse, where time and space are freakishly malleable. While Cates deadpans from the corner, her bandmates rumble at the fore, churning out foreign grooves that tick like broken clocks. It’s a disorienting dichotomy, but a rewarding one, too—often, it feels as if the band is inviting you to eavesdrop, to peer behind the mic and pick apart the musical assembly line. This is particularly fun on a track like “Dial Tone,” where guitar and drums make spirited conversation while Hemler’s bass occasionally interjects, a shy friend raising a shaky finger. It sounds like dinnertime in a dysfunctional household—that is, until the overdrive clicks on, and all interlocutors are rasping in unison, holding it for a few fiery seconds before hushing as if nothing happened. Lead single “Sea or War” rides breakneck percussion into elegiac highs; rather than stack ingredients like the shoegaze it invokes, this song deconstructs at the middle, building back up element by element. You can picture yourself front row at the show, swivel-necking to figure out which sound is coming from where. “Unsteady at the edge and falling in,” Cates sings. Twenty-somethings will be pleased to find that the view from the precipice isn’t all that bad.",0,"July 29, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/robber-robber-wild-guess/
Lava La Rue,Starface,6.9,Pop/R&B,"On Lava La Rue’s jangling new-wave jam “Push N Shuv,” the future collides with the past. La Rue’s vocal takes, recorded when the artist was 21, are a time capsule marking the exact moment they sowed the seeds that would become their debut album. The vocals intertwine with a piercing flute melody, which adds a dash of sci-fi surrealism to the otherwise retro funk groove. On STARFACE, the record that arrives five years after those vocals were recorded, La Rue continues to catalyze the old and the new. The result is a glistening mixture of psychedelic funk, ska punk, grunge, soul, and indie rock. La Rue—whose stage name is an anagram of their birth name, Ava Laurel (also spelled Aiwa Laurel)—was born in west London in 1998. Raised primarily by their Jamaican grandmother, they entered foster care in their teen years. Surrounded by the punk heritage of the West London estates they lived in, they started a DIY band of their own named the West Borns, which they’ve described as an aspiring “all-girl band version of the Clash.” Later, in school, they met fellow musicians Lloyd Macdonald and Jess Smyth—now known by stage names Mac Wetha and Biig Piig—with whom they formed the NiNE8 Collective. NiNE8 represent a radical proposition in a world of nepo babies: independent, working-class Gen Z artists who insist on splitting all profits equally between them, prioritizing community and collaboration above solo success. Alongside their work with the collective, La Rue has collaborated with artists including Clairo, Deb Never, and Vegyn on their own music—releasing a clutch of EPs blurring their indie, punk, and rap influences since 2017—as well as directing visuals for other artists, including Wet Leg. Lava heralded a hallucinogenic new era with their 2022 EP Hi-Fidelity, a mellow collection of breezy, trippy funk. On STARFACE, they lean further into that psychedelic sensibility, this time with bolder, braver melodies and a flair for the dramatic. The record hangs around a concept—an alien lands on Earth and learns about the destructive nature of human relationships (or as La Rue puts it, a “lesbian Ziggy Stardust”)—but following the narrative isn’t really necessary to enjoy the record’s plush, omnivorous sonic world. Written and recorded between London and L.A., the record has its feet on the rain-spattered concrete of La Rue’s childhood homes and its head in sunny California skies: Flecks of drum’n’bass and ska bump shoulders with soul, funk, and R&B. In keeping with La Rue’s collaborative spirit, STARFACE is full of features. Their NiNE8 peers take turns offering uneven but spirited verses on the bass-driven “Fluorescent Beyond Space”; Biig Piig’s feather-light delivery over a rush of Tame Impala-style synths makes a particularly dreamy impression. La Rue also looks outside the collective for creative input, conjuring a queer fantasy with K-indie star So Yoon on “INTERPLANETARY HOPPIN,” and romantically reimagining pirate-radio sounds with Malaysian-Irish artist Yunè Pinku on “Second Hand Sadness.” Meanwhile, on the muscular “Poison Cookie,” La Rue recruits New Jersey rapper Audrey Nuna for a rock anthem with real superhero fight montage energy. Fusing so many voices and genre elements can sometimes feel chaotic, but for the most part, La Rue makes it cohere. At 17 tracks long, STARFACE is hardly short on effervescent musical ideas, but it sags under the weight of its alien metaphors by the time you make it to the woozy outro of “Celestial Destiny.” Some of the record’s more on-the-nose hooks—“So many humans, and where’s the humanity?” La Rue sighs on “Humanity”—don’t live up to the gravitas promised by their sweeping grunge guitars and luxurious vocal layers. But elsewhere, as on the smooth funk of “Better,” which features Californian bedroom-pop star Cuco, La Rue uses that concise, plain-speaking style to distill hard-won wisdom into a perfectly simple pop hook: “It will not feel this way forever.” It’s clear that Lava La Rue’s ambition as an artist burns brightly. Right now, its light and heat is overflowing, a little messy and uncontained; but the stardust is unmistakable. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Merce Lemon,Watch Me Drive Them Dogs Wild,7.7,Rock,"When she was still in high school, the artist known as Merce Lemon legally changed her surname to Lemon. That potentially audacious move tells you everything you need to know about the Pittsburgh native’s ear for poetry and absolute confidence in her own vision. That’s “Lemon,” as in the fruit. Go ahead, say it back; run it between your teeth a few times. Even before you hear a single note of her music, you have the sense that she’s only going to do things her way. That current of surety runs through her folk- and country-tinged new album, Watch Me Drive Them Dogs Wild, which is warm, rustic, and fundamentally big-hearted—as indebted to softies like Lomelda as to rockers like Neil Young, with Lemon’s unhurried vocals as an anchor. Lemon pulled the title from a (maybe apocryphal) story about an old singer howling at a pack of dogs through his living room window, and wrote the album’s closing track around that idea: a Frank Lloyd Wright-ish melding of indoor and outdoor space, domestic scenes rubbing right up against the wilderness. Here, “lime zest on a bed of leaves” and “thoughts of a husband”—a slow, loping refrain that lends the song its center of gravity—are on equal footing. Lemon is as comfortable writing about frozen creeks and blueberry-laden branches as she is contemplating days spent alone and aimless in her room, staring at a wilting houseplant or tending to her cat, Moldy. Lemon’s last album, Moonth, tapped into a similar dichotomy but kept things a little livelier, a little more playful. Watch Me Drive Them Dogs Wild is a profoundly sad album. Lemon grew up in a musical household and has said she was influenced from an early age by Kimya Dawson, who even ended up staying on her couch when she came through Pittsburgh. But this new album is less Moldy Peaches or Frankie Cosmos than Hand Habits and Ethel Cain; you’ll find no miniatures here. Lemon is grasping at something big and resonant, something unconstrained by detail. To wit: The songs on Moonth had titles like “Hysterical Clavicle,” “Golden Lady Sauerkraut,” and “Chili Packet.” The tracks on Dogs are called things like “Rain,” “Window,” and “Crow,” and often sprawl out toward the five-minute mark. Maybe that’s just part of growing up; the vocabulary of whimsy can start to get old when it no longer speaks to your experience. Still, Lemon hasn’t lost her sense of humor. “Rain,” adapted from a friend’s poem about processing flax into linen, opens with a funny juxtaposition of direct and meta imagery: This sounds like a songI barfed out in the droughtA love song for the rainI miss you like the wind hugs wings It’s one of the album’s least structured songs, and the production is spare under these lilting lines—just a hint of strummed acoustic guitar—but you’d be hard-pressed to find another instance of the word “barf” expressed as sweetly as here. “Backyard Lover,” a smoldering highlight, builds to one of the album’s purest moments of emotional catharsis, and encapsulates many of its disparate threads. The song peaks with genuine shredding: the ecstatic moment when, over peals of electric guitar, Lemon calls out, “You fucking liar.” This is a track about grief and self-loathing, a reflection on the death of a friend, and there’s an extraordinary depth to the sadness she’s describing. Lemon is angry, but she’s ultimately also resigned. She wants to be alone, but she needs her friends. She’s struggling, but she’s trooping through it. She sounds like a lot of things—which is to say, she sounds like herself. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Pedro the Lion,Santa Cruz,7.3,Rock,"The first song on Santa Cruz, the seventh full-length album from Seattle’s Pedro the Lion, paraphrases no fewer than four separate Bible verses. More to the point, singer-songwriter David Bazan speaks in the kind of idioms that anyone who’s attended a Wednesday night youth group or summer church camp could instantly clock. Bazan repeats the lines, “If I make myself friendly/Put others’ needs before my own/Don’t let my heart be hardened,” then ends “It’ll All Work Out” with one load-bearing word: “Lord.” If the hymnal lyrics, somber synth notes, and slow-boiling discordance hadn’t fully illustrated his cry of prayer, the picture is complete now. This has been Bazan’s superpower from the start. He speaks to specific experiences with the requisite references, yet he doesn’t alienate the uninitiated. The Conflicted Christian, the Struggling Addict, the Anti-Corporatist, the Angry Ex, the Disillusioned American—all complex viewpoints vividly inhabited across Pedro the Lion’s discography. But since the band’s return from a 15-year hiatus in 2019, Bazan has narrowed his framing devices. Phoenix triumphantly kicked off a planned five-album arc, pairing big, resonant guitar chords with stories of formative years spent in the titular hometown. Three years later, Havasu relaxed its grip on rock theatrics to gently explore the thrills and contradictions of being a lonely, God-fearing seventh grader. With Santa Cruz, Bazan brings the theme of life as the preacher’s kid whose family moved around a lot into tighter focus. In just over a half hour, Santa Cruz spans a decade of Bazan’s life—from eighth grade into his early 20s, and the four cities he called home during that time. The songs cover an impressive amount of ground in painstaking detail, often within just a few minutes. The title track never drops its mid-tempo pulse as Bazan breathlessly recounts his embarrassing junior high backpack, C.S. Lewis novels, and how he can’t wait to get married and have sex. He’s never sounded so much like Mark Kozelek in his delivery, especially when the glut of stanzas forces him to cram in a line off-rhythm. “Teacher’s Pet” jumps from story to unfortunate story while fleshing out a bristly ode to teenage rebellion and learning through failure. The overtly Beatles-inspired “Little Help” shares how befriending a kid from church and discovering the White Album gave him confidence among the California beach town’s surfers and skaters. Santa Cruz is packed with memories, musings, and personality, like a well-used diary covered in old stickers. But where the lyrics and themes are consistently charming, the music isn’t always. Bazan frequently uses synths in the arrangements, and their presence in some of the best songs is refreshing: Downcast and dejected, “Don’t Cry Now” revolves around a chunky arpeggio that—somewhat incredibly—sounds lifted from an old Junior Boys single. The bobbing keys and quiet guitar on album standout “Tall Pines,” at first so contained, burst to envelop Bazan’s unflinchingly measured delivery like a sudden fog. “Parting,” however, is about as middling and generic as Pedro the Lion’s indie rock gets—unfortunate given its moving story of a high school senior whose parents move once again, leaving him to finish the year in Seattle. At least when the music is less than compelling, there’s always an affecting story to follow. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Machine Girl,MG Ultra,6.4,Electronic / Experimental / Metal,"If you took every single genre of mosh-pit-geared music, chewed it up, and spit it back out, the resulting wad might sound something like Machine Girl. Gabber, hardcore punk, noise rock, trance, drum’n’bass, djent—as long as it’s hard and fast, it’s fair game for Matt Stephenson and Sean Kelly’s arsenal. Their music together plays like the soundtrack to the final boss level of some finger-blistering bullet hell, Stephenson’s curdled screams clashing with Kelly’s battering-ram drums in an onslaught of cyberpunk sewage. Together they channel the pent-up energy of an isolated generation reclaiming raves for themselves, and like their forebears in Atari Teenage Riot, they make aggressively dystopian albums that revel in maximalism. Their music is never more alive than it is at their concerts, where Stephenson’s arcade-game sonics all blend into a nightmarish barrage of tinnitus-inducing frequencies. On record, it’s trickier to translate. Though the two have dialed up their production quality bit by bit, the music has mostly settled into a familiar rhythm ever since 2017’s …BECAUSE I’M YOUNG ARROGANT AND HATE EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR. Following some high-profile gigs, including touring with 100 gecs and soundtracking a first-person shooter game, their latest, MG Ultra, arrives via Future Classic, making Machine Girl labelmates with the likes of Flume—a career move that could suggest the duo is attempting to take its renegade routine to the next level. Yet while MG Ultra makes a few slight gestures at a more polished version of Machine Girl, by and large, it’s business as usual here, with Stephenson and Kelly hurtling through track after overloaded track. “Sick!!!” continually ratchets up its hardcore attack: “I roll my thoughts up and smoke them,” Stephenson howls in a paranoid panic, declaring himself “at war with the cerebral assassins” until the song finally reaches an all-out gabber meltdown. It’s an overwhelming assault on the senses, but the constant glut of effects ultimately ends up dragging the track down, keeping it from hitting as hard as it should. Most of the album offers slight updates on Machine Girl’s M.O.: “Until I Die” imbues their usual drum’n’bass assault with cleaner vocals, while the jungly “Schizodipshit” details the nihilistic mindset of a blackpilled school-shooter type. For all the songs’ blunt impact, there’s so much focus on cramming the midrange that any dynamics get lost in the process. “Motherfather” marks the most drastic new direction, incorporating a slow, grungy guitar chorus for a rallying cry against disappointed parents everywhere. “Motherfather/Motherfather/I’m not your boy/Motherfather/Motherfather/Why did you bother at all?” Stephenson howls; you can practically see him slamming a door covered in Serial Experiments Lain posters in their faces. The glitchy electronics of the verses are too disconnected from everything else to completely work, but it does carve out new space in Machine Girl’s angsty universe. At its best, MG Ultra refines Machine Girl’s production so that the duo’s strung-out sound connects with even more projectile force. Being able to make out each squelchy bass tone in the acidic “Nu Nu Meta Phenomena,” or the airy chords that glide through “Psychic Attack,” keeps the tracks from descending into aimless yelling. The most promising idea appears in the house boogie of “Grindhouse,” whose more club-friendly BPM actually gives its red-alert synths a chance to land. But too often, MG Ultra ends up in a nebulous middle zone that’s missing the bite of its influences, with neither the satisfying build and release of a well-paced hard trance mix, the fully freeform chaos of a good grindcore set, or the stripped-down rage of the best punk riffs. It identifies what these various styles have in common, but for all its attempts at simulating the inside of a 3D shoot-em-up, it ends up feeling frustratingly one-dimensional.

Dirty Three,Love Changes Everything,8.0,Rock,"At their best, Dirty Three can sound like they might fall apart in an instant. Listen to the way “Ember,” from 2005’s expansive Cinder, seems forever to wobble, as if Warren Ellis’ violin were about to stumble into the canyon created by Jim White’s loping drums. Or ponder how Ellis and guitarist Mick Turner skirt the void while upbraiding their strings during “Red,” from 1996’s breakthrough Horse Stories. An unusually expressive instrumental trio, these three longtime Melbourne chums have always used the tension between their respective playing to foster collective feelings of annoyance or ecstasy, boredom or wonder, anxiety or amusement. In doing so, they have often suggested some ornate mobile hanging from an art museum’s ceiling, its three bejeweled pieces bound together only by rusted wire, perpetually at risk of clattering to the ground. The thrill has been hearing them hold it together. On Love Changes Everything, Dirty Three’s first album in a dozen years, those corroded wires finally snap, leaving the pieces to smash to the floor and reorient themselves in new relationships. And they do: Ellis, White, and Turner have never sounded so alternately tight and loose, so unified and amorphous, capturing an emotional ambiguity that drifts between hope and despair. Forgoing their usual evocative song titles in favor of a suite of numbered pieces that often flow into and out of one another, Dirty Three have made not only their most absorbing album but also the one that’s most open to interpretation. It is a convincing case study in how a veteran band, each member now nearing or beyond 60, can evolve—letting go, once and for all, of preconceptions and self-perceptions and simply meeting where they are. Dirty Three emerged in the early ’90s from exuberant youthful squalor, playing long hours in Australian bars for crowds that found them perplexing or polarizing. But international attention, especially in the United States, became their passport. They toured doggedly and collaborated promiscuously. White and Turner joined Cat Power for 1998’s Moon Pix. Ellis partnered with another expat, Nick Cave, in a prolific ongoing relationship. As the years passed, Dirty Three themselves became more focused, as if the band were a repository for a specific subset of sounds and ideas for musicians who were otherwise busy doing lots of things—painting and making exquisite solo records, playing with Bill Callahan and dozens of others, becoming a score-writing Bad Seed. These days, Ellis, Turner, and White are scattered across continents and hemispheres—Turner in Melbourne, White in Brooklyn, Ellis in Paris. Their separate careers and lives have made them less subservient to outstanding notions of what the Dirty Three are meant to be. “We sat down and played, which is what we used to do in the early days,” as Ellis told The Guardian of the 2022 session that rendered Love Changes Everything, “informed by the sort of Impulse! records where they just got in and blew, you know?” This looseness is Love Changes Everything’s new boon, as if the Dirty Three have finally obtained permission to be whatever they want. Ellis actually sings on the second piece. His looped sighs and plaintive piano chords serve as the soft canvas for a kind of fragmented duet between White and Turner. Bandmates since the mid-’80s, the two size one another up after reuniting in a cozy Melbourne studio, as if nodding their greetings. It feels like a bittersweet hymn for aging and surviving. Its successor suggests a group hug or a lazy late-night conversation after a long day of work, each member of the trio contributing a bit that interlaces with the rest of the band. In the last minute, especially, Ellis’ pizzicato plucks casually slip into perfect lockstep with the slow sway shared between Turner and White. But the key to Dirty Three remains unchanged: the way each member can somehow play something that seems largely unrelated to the rest of the band, yet still works within the whole. Zoom in on an individual part or zoom out for the gestalt of it all: Dirty Three’s music suits either perspective. It’s like staring at a Clyfford Still painting, as mesmerized by each discrete block of color as the entire enormous piece. During the opener, you can follow Turner’s clinched guitar part from its beginning amplifier groan to its introductory coiled riff to its final splenetic variation. White first taps in as if to take the group’s temperature, mostly disappears for the better part of a minute, and then rumbles back in with Keith Moon-sized might. The whole track is a demented and joyous leap into kosmische oblivion, each player pushing the others deeper into a trance. With Dirty Three, and especially on Love Changes Everything, the whole is not necessarily greater than the sum of its parts; it’s just perplexingly different, the quality that makes this music feel like a discovery every time you listen. Love Changes Everything ends with two interconnected pieces that, together, constitute 16 of Dirty Three’s most beautiful and emotional minutes in 32 years. At the start, they steadily ratchet the intensity, Ellis’ violin wailing like a mourner over drum-and-guitar interplay that conjures the devotional tizzy of Gnaoua music. Just when it becomes feverish, though, the spell breaks, pieces falling again to the floor. Ellis is the first to return for the finale, his call-and-response violin pulling the rest of the band toward the center. By the track’s end, his piano flurries, White’s circular drums, and Turner’s guitar shards coil into one, moving as a peristaltic wave. Dirty Three have rarely sounded as triumphant as they do here, locked into the pure communion of making music together. They steadily rise, stretching back toward the ceiling until, without warning, they collapse one more time. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Kelly Lee Owens,Dreamstate,7.6,Electronic,"October 2024 marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of the Surrealist Manifesto, which kicked off a century of art shaped by the subconscious mind. But even without that historic spur, this year was already setting out to be one for the dreamers. From a spate of excellent hypnagogic releases to the popularity of hit em, a genre that quite literally came to the public in the form of a dream, there’s been an undeniable appetite for music that taps into the gauzy edge of the listener’s focus and transports them somewhere else entirely. All of which is to say, it’s an excellent time for a new Kelly Lee Owens album. The Welsh singer and producer has spent her career toggling between levels of definition, easing and sharpening her focus to capture dream states with varying degrees of lucidity. Her self-titled debut and 2020’s Inner Song fused the weightlessness of dream pop with techno’s mechanical heft, leveraging the former’s vaporous uplift and the latter’s cold circuitry to create music that soared and pulsed in equal measure. Owens cleared the air on 2022’s LP.8, setting fire to her music’s atmosphere by replacing its pillowy reverb with noisy distortion. On songs like “Release” and “Anadlu,” she switched up her voice from a caress into a command, becoming the strict but familiarizing counterpoint to the instrumental violence she summoned. Contrary to what its title might suggest, Dreamstate is not a return to the mistiness of her early records but her most total refinement to date, stripping her sound to its most essential parts while preserving its mesmerizing edge. The newfound clarity throughout much of Dreamstate means that you can better appreciate the contours of Owens’ rhythmic muscle, the sheer amount of craft that goes into the propulsive thrust of her music. Where soothing drone and blankets of reverb helped cushion the thump of previous tracks, many of the songs on this record are massive and glittering techno behemoths. “Sunshine,” “Dark Angel” and “Air” rise and recede over brilliantly multi-colored synths, gathering and refracting light like skyscrapers against a sunset. The title track is a peak-time banger, a side-winding rave anthem that sounds as if the acid-house climax of Madonna’s “Ray of Light” had been stretched into eternity. On “Love You Got,” Owens deploys a flickering drum machine that subtly nudges the song into motion as she layers jagged bass synths that are only a few hairs short of belonging to a Brazilian funk track. Dreamstate is also an excellent showcase for Owens’ voice. Where on previous records Owens sang behind a curtain of effects or used her vocals as pure, disembodied texture, here her singing is set powerfully to the fore. Her performance is most successful on the Chemical Brothers-assisted “Ballad (In the End),” where she properly belts, rising far above the stirring, synthetic strings to achieve a sweeping perspective about a relationship’s end. Occasionally, though, the straightforwardness of her vocal performance, on tracks like “Love You Got” and “Time To,” registers as slightly basic against the adventurous rush of her music. The clarity of Dreamstate’s production also means that any flaws in Owens’ songwriting, which has always been a little woo-woo, are laid bare. Self-love clichés (“It’s time to find/The love inside your mind”), canned hippie imagery (“I see the sun coming up/I feel it all/Rise, rise up/I feel the love”), and repetition that should be evocative but is merely distracting (“Dreamstate… the Dreamstate”) are more front and center than they ought to be. Yet despite these small hitches, Dreamstate nonetheless feels like an exciting step forward. After mastering light and shadows, Owens has created a leaner and more direct record that uses ultra-crisp and gleamingly bright production to find a whole new way to dream.

Margaux,Inside the Marble,7.1,Folk/Country,"Sometimes you go through a breakup and feel like you could just wither away; sometimes you read the news and are reminded that one day, the sun really will just wither away. Regardless of their respective scales, both problems can feel equally real. But the collision of these micro and macro heartaches can be destabilizing. “If I change my life/Will I die?” singer-songwriter Margaux Bouchegnies, who performs mononymously as Margaux, wonders on her debut album, Inside the Marble, pondering quandaries both personal and existential against dreamy, imaginative soundscapes. Bouchegnies is a recent graduate of the New School; since finishing her studies, she’s become a fixture in the Brooklyn music scene, touring as a bassist with acts like Katy Kirby and Dougie Poole. Inside the Marble was crafted in the throes of that uncertain moment when the structures of academia fall away and you’re thrust into the so-called real world. It builds on her debut EP, 2019’s More Brilliant Is the Hand That Throws the Coin, which established her as an artist who could deftly capture the tumult of young love. You can hear the fruits of her coursework in her songwriting; she quotes Susan Sontag on More Brilliant’s “Faced With Fire,” and later released a set of songs inspired by the life and work of Emily Dickinson. Bouchegnies has said that Inside the Marble is about “making sense of big feelings,” and she constructs appropriately cinematic backdrops for each of them. The moody “Midnight Contact” starts downbeat and minimalist, then builds to dizzying heights; it sounds like it could soundtrack the moment in a coming-of-age film where the wistful protagonist makes a life-altering decision. The songs are layered and dense—Bouchegnies plays guitar, bass, Mellotron, glockenspiel, Farfisa, Wurlitzer, and piano, while producer Sahil Ansari adds percussion and tape loops; other collaborators contribute trombone, violin, and clarinet. The arrangements are lush and naturalistic, filled with charming, well-placed details: the swooping strings on “Picture It,” a touch of pedal steel on “Dissolve / Resolve,” ghostly backing vocals on “Sadie Something.” The overall effect, though, remains surprisingly gentle, thanks in large part to Bouchegnies’ voice, which floats above the arrangements and rarely ever strays from its steady, self-assured delivery. Her emotions range from the quotidian to the universal. On “Ships,” heartbreak is like a storm at sea, threatening to knock her overboard; later, on “Make the Move,” she’s reaching toward new love, sounding positively smitten over plucked acoustic guitar and steady percussion. On propulsive tracks like “Picture It” and “Sadie Something,” she contemplates time’s endless march towards oblivion: “Everybody/One by one takes/Off into the great unknown,” she declares on the latter. Intellectually, we might understand that not all anxieties (the social awkwardness she details on “What Could I Say?” or the what-am-I-doing-with-my-life paralysis of “I Can’t Decide”) are equally consequential. But it doesn’t always feel that way—especially in young adulthood, when our norms and values still have some settling in to do. It’s charming to hear Bouchegnies consider all these big feelings deeply, drawing an entire universe out of them before moving on, curiously and carefully, to the next.",0,"June 10, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/margaux-inside-the-marble/
Vince Staples,Dark Times,7.6,Rap,"Vince Staples is not the rapper you come to for lyrical acrobatics. His bars are stark, jumping between straightforward recountings of gang-related violence and bits of dry humor fit for a Mitch Hedberg set. Both also extend into his presence as one of the rap internet’s favorite talking heads; he can turn an explanation of why he doesn’t share his home address with his closest friends into a hilarious exchange—until you stop to think about what exactly makes him so guarded. This candor helps his stories, jokes, and his recent Coen Brothers-indebted Netflix series, The Vince Staples Show, stick to the ribs. Looking back, Dark Times feels like a logical progression from his last few projects. During the press run for 2022’s Ramona Park Broke My Heart, Staples admitted he was ready to move on from making “an anthology of my neighborhood and my past,” a promise he frequently bends to suit his needs. Dark Times has plenty of trauma, but the difference is it more directly intersects with his present life as a celebrity trying to stay out of the way. “Children’s Song” hangs a lantern on this idea early by starting as a rallying cry for a friend who’s locked up before offering a cold reality check: “Niggas be like ‘Aye bro, ‘member back when?/Let it go, loc/I’m way too rich to be your friend/I’m way too lit to let you dim me,” he says in his trademark deadpan. That couplet is even more cutting when this hook follows just two bars later: “Don’t play with my Crippin’, go play with your kids, bitch.” He’s having his cake and eating it in the most Vince Staples way imaginable. Staples’ monotone voice used to dilute his more intense songs, but now he just sounds tired of having to read everything and everyone for an angle. After mapping out hip-hop toxicity over EDM and techno beats (made specifically for sync licensing) on Big Fish Theory and memorializing the California of his youth on his 2021 self-titled album and Ramona Park, who wouldn’t be? His insouciance still leads to great stories and affirmations of Black resilience, but what once registered as body blows now lands like a firm but loving grasp on the shoulder from an older relative. “Justin” slowly builds romantic tension up to its bombshell ending—the woman Staples is courting suddenly introduces him to her actual boyfriend as her little cousin—and then discards it with a shrug, like Staples is mad at himself for getting caught up. Other highlights like “Étouffée” and “‘Radio’” recast old encounters and family history as edifying parables for a stolen youth. On the former, Staples’ connections to Louisiana inspire him to chart a path from toting guns in Polo pajamas to a place where it’s a privilege to be told your music fell off. Later, “‘Radio’” draws bridges between chance encounters with music, from having his life changed after hearing Blu & Exile’s Below the Heavens to appreciating Brandy and Roberta Flack more after a bad breakup. Using his still-blistering concision, these lessons flesh out aspects of Staples’ notoriously private life and give credence to motivational pieces like “Little Homies” and the opening verse for “Freeman.” It’s easier to take Staples’ advice (“You don’t gotta crash out for the set, lil homie/Keep your head on the swivel when you step”) and longing (“I’ll never find a equal mind, I’ll settle for the fattest ass”) seriously when he’s laid out the steps he took to get there. The production is where Dark Times can sometimes go from stoic to sleepy. On the surface, italso seems like the next logical step in Staples’ journey. A grip of producers both established (Michael Uzowuru, Jay Versace, Cardo) and more obscure (LeKen Taylor, Saint Mino) come together to offer a sound mixing the maudlin Cali worship of Ramona Park and the chirpy minimalism of the self-titled with a stately, polished tone. Staples often sounds best when the beat is busier than he is; or else he risks being dragged down by the BPM. That risk actually pays off on lead single “Shame On The Devil,” whose gauzy thump and smooth chorus from North Carolina singer Baby Rose is countered with some of Staples’ wonkiest vocals and the long hard looks at love and fame warbling through them. Otherwise, these are workmanlike mid-tempo cuts, occasionally to a fault. The Cali sway that never truly leaves Staples’ music is most apparent in the rattling synths and drum claps of “Étouffeé” and the disco-leaning rhythm of “Little Homies,” both viscous and smooth like olive oil flowing down the walls of a glass bottle. “Government Cheese” and “Freeman” lack the spark of the rest, generic offerings that are carried by Staples as opposed to both shouldering each other’s weight. There’s nothing on Dark Times that’s surprising and challenging for Staples but little that detracts from what already works. There are several moments on Staples’ Netflix show that, while definitely exaggerated, display the banal insanity of his life as a niche rapper: A bank he’s visiting to get a business loan is robbed by a group who turn out to be homies from around the way; family members press him for money while eating ribs at a cookout; his celebrity is constantly cast as either a non-starter or enough to get him shot at or jumped by theme park mascots. That same attitude, slightly toned down, flows through Dark Times. There’s nothing grand or portentous about this album—every win, mistake, lost loved one, and lesson is presented as a fact of life. Perhaps he’ll never truly get past reconciling the scars of his upbringing with staring down a million dollars for the first time in disbelief. “Life hard, but I go harder,” he sings softly on “Little Homies,” as much a reminder to himself as it is to the youth tracing his steps.

Dua Saleh,I SHOULD CALL THEM,7.4,Pop/R&B,"Over the span of three striking EPs, Dua Saleh has established themself as a genre-agnostic shape-shifter. Pulling strands from R&B, pop, trap, and gospel, the restless Sudanese American artist and occasional actor locates pathos in brooding backdrops: A menacing club beat, downcast piano, and airy string suite all form sturdy foundations for Saleh’s drifting falsetto and surly rapping about everything from queer romance to wrestling with the devil. They continue to morph on debut album I SHOULD CALL THEM, concentrating their style into a dusky, dexterous homebrew of pop-R&B, rap, and rock songs whose lyrics seesaw between swaggering and lovesick. It’s an inventive and sinewy mix that shifts the dial toward deeper, more expressive songwriting and production. I SHOULD CALL THEM follows a loose concept—two lovers meet, break up, and reunite against the backdrop of the apocalypse—but the dystopian storyline is less a plot to follow closely than scaffolding for the glowering atmosphere. The electric guitar and explosive drums on “Want” fill out the song’s story about a sometime lover’s magnetic pull, while the intoxicating “Pussy Suicide” follows a loping, waterlogged beat to track Saleh’s romantic back-and-forth: “Was I leading you on when I told you I was really healing?” they ask sweetly. “I think we could benefit from room for breathing.” Later, on the highlight “Unruly,” they cast serpentwithfeet to intone the song’s pensive chorus—“How’d I get so unruly?/How’d I get so wild?”—while Saleh provides boastful counters to answer the question. The pair, dancing over rattling percussion and low-lit synths, are impeccable complements for one another. Saleh finds unity amid chaotic emotions via their tactile voice, molded and shaped to exceedingly elastic effect. They sound gossamer-light when exorcising a diabolic situationship on “Playing Games” and emit a blood-curdling scream on the thundering climax that caps off closer “2excited.” Saleh most often pitches up into a silvery falsetto, adding a slick, singsong pep to even the most disrespectful lyrics, à la agile vocalists like Amaarae. “Your bitch she always be crowding me/Says I’m her new sexuality,” they boast in a pitch-shifted warble on “Coast,” an otherwise deceptively laid-back track featuring R&B crooner Gallant. Later, they rewire nursery rhymes to filthy ends on “Bo Peep,” one of the few songs where you get a dose of humor to lighten the mood—it takes skill to make a line like “Patty gotta cake that she wanting me to taste” roll off the tongue, and Saleh’s nervy delivery makes it click into place. Saleh occasionally slips into more generic material—opener “Chi Girl,” despite a memorable chorus dedicated to a girl they met in the Windy City (“Chi girl, what’s the mood?/I like that you’re kind of rude”), doesn’t move much past its initial conceit. “Cradle” also gets stuck in a holding pattern of blown-out drum programming that doesn’t do lyrics like “sparks that fly like fate” any favors. But those are minor missteps, considering how frequently I SHOULD CALL THEM bends toward different, more appealing shapes. Saleh’s breathy performance on the guitar-tinged “Time and Time Again” curlicues into a pillowy, melodic chorus; the slow-groove R&B highlight “Television,” a duet with the underrated New Orleans singer Ambré, is a treatise on desire that builds to a melting climax with fogged-out saxophone and keys. It proves Saleh’s determination to switch things up at every turn, following their own arrow in a way that keeps you on your toes.

New York,Rapstar*,7.3,Pop/R&B,"New York are masters of anhedonic pop. The drolly named duo—26-year-old Estonian performance artist Gretchen Lawrence and 24-year-old Senegalese-American visual artist and model Coumba Samba—ostensibly draw from club music and hip-hop, but you can’t imagine their second album, Rapstar*, giving anyone the energy to lift their feet from the ground. It’s remarkably dead-eyed music, characterized by Samba’s sardonic deadpan and chilly minimalist glitches that sound like the Sheffield experimental duo snd as covered by the girls from Gossip Girl. The most excitable that the two musicians sound on Rapstar*—which is not very excitable at all—is when they splice their voices together on the title track to deliver a terse, twisted assessment of modern life: “The government will fuck you/And claim you deserve it.” Where so much prototypical “Gen Z music” uses maximalism to capture a sense of overwhelmed disaffectedness—think Babyxsosa beginning a song by yelling and ending it as if she’s been distracted by her phone—New York take a different tack. Rapstar* is both mundane and disorienting, down to its format: On Bandcamp and streaming services, it’s been inexplicably split into two volumes, subtitled Side A and Side B, meaning that you’ll have to make a playlist of all the tracks to listen in one go, or otherwise fiddle with Spotify halfway through, as if you’re flipping a record. On “bronx,” Samba repeats the phrase “In the Bronx I walk” until it takes on the character of Sisyphean struggle; on “no bra,” New York–based performance artist No Bra mutters about “Making out with no dress” over a subliminal, mutant footwork beat and improvised piano, making for an unpleasant but resolute answer to the question, “What does a sex jam sound like for a generation that reportedly hates sex?” It is frequently irritating music, but if you’re someone who’s frequently irritated by the world around you—who, for example, wants to scream about the fact that there are two Blank Street Coffees within 100 feet of Tottenham Court Road station—it can feel kind of soothing, a representation of modernity that depicts life as neither distorted and maximalist nor gloomily dystopic, but somewhere in the middle. New York’s debut, 2022’s darkly funny No Sleep Till N.Y., leaned enough into electroclash and ’00s signifiers—skinny jeans, the aforementioned Gossip Girl lilt of Samba’s voice—that it could broadly be tied into a broader reappraisal of “indie sleaze” and blog house, an idea furthered by last year’s “night n day,” on which they flipped the hook of Ladytron’s “Seventeen” into something even creepier and more depressing than the original. Rapstar* still kind of sounds like “Shoes,” particularly on “kicks,” on which Samba recites lyrics about shoe addiction over an IDM hum, but it also feels less indebted to the past than previous New York music. Perhaps that’s due to the fact that Rapstar* is being released on Relaxin Records, which is run by Alina Astrova (aka Lolina, fka Inga Copeland), whose music, like New York’s, seems interested in contrasting deconstructed musical forms with the straightforward immediacy of pop music. New York’s music doesn’t necessarily scan as pop, but it does perfect a vernacular that speaks to the overly detached, ironically branded way people talk online. On “low,” Rapstar*’s final song, Lawrence whispers lyrics that sound like bargain-bin affirmations designed to narrativize an otherwise dull existence: “Zone out when you talk/Indie girl on the go/Lazy for attention/Hearteyes for the dough.” It’s the kind of cruelly ironic, halfheartedly you-go-girl sentiment you might sing to yourself before clocking on and zoning out.",0,"July 24, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/new-york-rapstar/
Amaarae,"roses are red, tears are blue — A Fountain Baby Extended Play",7.8,Pop/R&B,"Amaarae songs have the icy glamor of luxury photography, but none of the stillness. Guided by her fluid coos, the Ghanaian American singer’s restless Afropop constantly flows and bubbles, liquid and frothy as seafoam. On last year’s globetrotting Fountain Baby, she played a Dionysian priestess, extolling the wonders of pussy and premium goods over beats that bridged Accra, Virginia Beach, and Hokkaido. A line from “Angels in Tibet” captures her constant pairing of opulence and exertion: “Diamonds hit the sweat.” In Amaarae’s music, even the jewels get wet.The follow-up EP, roses are red, tears are blue — A Fountain Baby Extended Play, is just as soaked and luxurious, though the mood is more subdued. The lyrics aren’t as manic; the songs don’t erupt into mall punk and dream pop; and the samples aren’t as eclectic, but an Amaarae after-party is still a romp. She continues to twist her lithe voice into sensuous and alien shapes, her indelible coolness always stemming from her boundless sense of play. For her, flexing is a love language. The rich production, sourced from core collaborators like KZ Didit and Kyu Steed, blends alté, highlife, R&B, and house. The songs are svelte, but always textured, the airy melodies and swinging polyrhythms layered with strings, horns, and synths. If Fountain Baby was a flying circus, roses is a homecoming parade, grounded but no less colorful. The wistful “wanted” works a slinky vocal sample, breathy harmonies, and pattering drums into a gentle groove. “I’ll be wanted,” Amaarae and OVO signee Naomi Sharon sing with resolve. The affirmation is vulnerable and cocky, fit to be chanted alone or whispered to a rival. Amaarae’s longtime admiration of Young Thug is obvious on this record. She raps in double-time on “jehovah witness,” her verses frequently erupting into giddy ad-libs and yelps. On the triumphant “this!” her slippery melodies burst into squeals of delight. “Thirty carat diamonds on my wrist/And I’m a vigilante/No fit close my case,” she shrieks, her pitch and lyrics channeling the incarcerated rapper. She’s not as chaotic or expressive as Thug, but she shares his conviction that perpetual motion is the ultimate freedom.Of course, sometimes even unbothered playgirls get played. Beneath the splendor and swagger of these songs runs an undercurrent of longing. “Sweetie, darling/Darling, sweetie/Pick up/The phone/And call me when you miss me,” she pleads on the sun-drenched “sweeeet,” like a ghosted lover leaving a voicemail. Pet names and a chippy delivery belie her anxious pining. On “diamonds,” a humid dance cut, gleaming gemstones offer little consolation as a relationship falls apart. “Who’s that you been calling, texting/Shawty, finessing/To love me is a blessing/Guess I never learn my lesson,” she sings with resignation. Heartbreak, joy, and self-assurance converge on highlight and explicit Jeffery Williams ode “THUG (Truly Humble Under God),” which takes its title from a moment in the ongoing and surreal YSL trial. The ballad is one of the most minimalistic in Amaarae’s catalog; it opens with a sampled prayer for blessings, then builds slowly toward catharsis. She sounds nervous the first time she sings the chorus. “I don’t fold under pressure/I don’t fall under pain/Tomorrow might be better/But I’m looking forward today,” she murmurs into a void of plangent piano and strings. But as the instruments grow bolder and the drums rush in, her voice lifts, and the hook turns exultant, as if she’s breached after a deep dive.The pop experimentalist is always in pursuit of relief in her songs—through sex, through expression, through motion. But here, confidence alone doesn’t guarantee it, a twist that adds new tension to her bustling music. Amaarae sticks to her signature carefree debauchery for most of roses, but she remains a shapeshifter.",0,"June 28, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/amaarae-roses-are-red-tears-are-blue-a-fountain-baby-extended-play/
Geordie Greep,The New Sound,7.2,Rock,"This guy knows he shouldn’t say the word “pussy.” The protagonist of Geordie Greep’s “Holy, Holy” has just spent two minutes yapping at a woman about his sexual reputation—how well-known he is among the Japanese and French Guyanese, how he’s like a god to the “jihadis” and “revolutionaries”—when he stumbles into a wildly distasteful pickup line. “I’ll bet your pussy is holy, too,” he says, chomping down on the word like it’s a cocktail straw between rear molars. He doesn’t want to say it, you can tell, but he can’t help himself, torn as he is between good manners and a crippling horniness that can only come from being profoundly lonely. That strained “pussy” is the linchpin of The New Sound, the former black midi frontman’s debut solo record. This is an album full of dudes who are beset by a misery they can’t communicate, one that forces them into saying and doing things they know they probably shouldn’t. Across its 62 minutes, men in bars and nightclubs and boardrooms seem almost as if they’re competing to see who can abase themselves the furthest. These men aren’t gigachads or alphas on the hunt, though most of them aspire to both. They are, to a man, ridiculous. “I would’ve disemboweled myself just to hold your hand,” one declares, while another, inflamed by a sex worker with college aspirations, insists that he’s curious “to see what you think of Proust.” They are failures on their own terms—seldom do they seem to successfully bed a woman, even when they’re attempting to pay for sex—which makes their failures of ethics and good taste even starker. Depending on your appreciation of over-the-top genre workouts à la Frank Zappa and Mr. Bungle, it’s either a deft artistic gambit or just delicious irony that these unsubtle, easily hateable characters are the focal point of unsubtle music that often risks being incredibly annoying. As a satirist, Greep shares an absurdist humanism and love of classic songwriting with Randy Newman (though it’s difficult to picture the latter singing a line like “You can cum more than 100 stallions”), but he lets both play out as minor elements within a turbulent, mile-a-minute style. Across The New Sound, his characters chatter their way through a pub mix of choppy salsa, mid-century showtunes, smooth jazz, Isley Brothers guitar disco, big-budget samba, and a dozen other styles you could imagine the characters in a Steely Dan song listening to (including the music of Steely Dan). It’s a minor miracle of control that, even when it’s sprinting through stylistic hairpin turns, The New Sound never oversteers into pastiche, nor does it follow the same change-for-change’s-sake logic that made black midi technically impressive but emotionally distant. The music tends to move in natural, if often incredibly unlikely, directions, and Greep’s love for this stuff is obvious. The New Sound is often zany, chummy, and charmingly overeager to connect; you can feel the songs’ clammy hands pumping yours as they introduce themselves. But like a stockbroker returning from a bump in the bathroom, they rattle on at a pace that can snuff out fascinating creative sparks before they have a chance to fully catch. That restlessness, coupled with an exhausting parade of lecherous losers, makes The New Sound great in small doses but a lot to swallow over the course of an hour. Nevertheless, Greep himself makes for consistently good company. Where most satirists might drop a single telling detail that gives their character away, he overloads these songs with phrases, images, and quips that seem to match the overblown personalities of the characters themselves; they’re photorealistic portraits drawn in hyperbole. The narrator of “Through a War” bombards the woman he’s singing to with questions, each one an attempt to neg her for her lack of experience and puff up his own bona fides: “Have you ever seen a man beg for his life?” “Have you tasted human flesh?” “Have you seen a woman give birth to a goat?” His desperation is overwhelming, and it shifts into tragicomedy when he thanks her for giving him “an incurable disease” (“for which I’m so glad, you’ll always be with me,” he quickly adds). Like any good storyteller, Greep complicates his characters by giving us a peek of their motivating sadness. “I want you to put your hand on my knee,” the narrator of “Holy, Holy” finally tells the sex worker he’s spent the past five minutes badgering. “Will that be alright?” This kind of thing always risks the criticism that it’s normalizing the repugnant, as if pointing out that people do terrible things because of their own brokenness is somehow excusing the behavior itself. Greep never lets his characters off the hook—the best a Greep guy can hope for is to look incredibly pathetic—but to his immense credit, he never lets the audience off the hook, either. Throughout The New Sound he forces confrontations with all kinds of crass behavior—like the executive who takes a lunchtime sex break and can “still smell her snatch” while flipping through paperwork after—which in turn rounds these characters out even further. To shy away from such visceral details in the name of good taste would be to risk flattening their vulgarity. Besides, the dictates of good taste are obviously not of much interest to Geordie Greep. He doesn’t so much embrace slickness as grease his songwriting with it, keeping the full-throttle engines he built with black midi intact and firing. These songs might have all the aesthetic trappings of, say, Milton Nascimento’s sophisticated samba, but they never quite feel at ease with that fact. You can hear it in the title track, an antsy revue that comes in the wake of “Holy, Holy” and mimics both the “Woody Woodpecker” melody and the riff from Led Zeppelin’s “Fool in the Rain” while also calling to mind crisp ECM guitar records like John Abercrombie’s 39 Steps or Pat Metheny’s New Chautauqua. These are sounds worthy of attention, but they each require breathing room to work properly. Given the relentless thrust of these songs, the stylistic departures often remain adjacent to one another rather than melding into something new. The imperative to keep pushing forward is especially frustrating in “Bongo Season,” which Greep and his band have been stretching to nearly 20 minutes live but is the only song on The New Sound not to break the three-minute mark. It opens with a twilit conversation between spiritual jazz keyboards, bongos, and twinned salsa-boogie guitar solos from Greep and Daniel Rogerson. The airiness of the interplay, and the patience with which it develops, lightly recall Alice Coltrane and Carlos Santana’s Illuminations, and they offer fascinating possibilities for Greep and his band. Instead, the musicians chase the verse melody in a gorgeous low-key jam, then quickly usher the song out, shutting it down before it can develop. Maneuvers like those mean that The New Sound is never really pretty, even though it often seems like it should be. It’s too frantic, too kinetic, and has too many places to be, which over the course of the album makes the essential beauty of Greep’s singing and the featherlight precision of his band feel like a front they’re tiring of holding up. It’s fitting, even artistically admirable, that such strain makes The New Sound’s music an appropriate wingman for characters who struggle to maintain basic human kindness. But it sure makes for an uncomfortable conversation. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Basic Channel,BCD,9.4,Electronic,"The first records to carry the Basic Channel name wore it quietly, stretching and distorting the text across each record’s center label, and rendering it fainter with each release. Was Basic Channel an artist’s name? Placed alongside titles like “Phylyps Trak” and “Quadrant Dub,” the early records seemed to imply as much, even as others, like “Enforcement” and “Inversion,” were credited to someone called Cyrus. Perhaps, then, Basic Channel was a record label. But who was Cyrus? And who was responsible for pressing these elegant 12"" singles? With visual design that nodded to conceptual art’s brief fascination with Xerox machines during the 1960s, they made a clean break with the futuristic features of Detroit techno, which was just beginning to settle into orthodoxy by the early 1990s. Wherever they came from and whoever was behind them, nothing else sounded quite like Basic Channel. The project moved quickly, producing nine 12"" singles for the label between 1993 and 1994. The records were austere yet intricately constructed, using atmospheric synths and studio effects to create astoundingly dense structures that revealed new patterns with each listen. The duo’s first single, 1993’s “Enforcement,” accosts listeners with a brutal synth loop that repeats, with slight variations, for the duration of the 13-minute track. Yet those subtle changes make all the difference; muffled hi-hats and hard-panned synth pulses peek through at steady intervals, colliding with the original synth sequence to reveal new contours as the track progresses. The approach borrows as much from Manuel Göttsching’s motorik E2-E4 as it does from the dizzying phase music of minimalist pioneer Steve Reich, churning forward at a relentless pace without inducing fatigue. The pair would ultimately turn away from thundering techno, shifting their focus to subtle textures. But the single contains a template for much of what would follow, introducing mixing techniques that prioritize space, as well as a careful focus on process, that Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald—the press-shy individuals eventually revealed as the artists behind the alias—would carry throughout their careers. The track, like others including “Q1.1/I” and “Octagon,” was heavily inspired by Detroit techno, taking influence from Juan Atkins, Jeff Mills, Robert Hood, and labels like Metroplex and Underground Resistance. This scene was the blueprint from which Basic Channel would establish—and perfect—a completely new sound of their own. To purists both then—a period when techno’s sprawling nightlife network was just beginning to coalesce against the backdrop of German reunification—and now, dub techno begins and ends with Basic Channel, whose 1995 compilation BCD remains the genre’s defining document. On first listen, it might be difficult to tell why the compilation is so revered. Gone is the adrenaline rush that defined early singles like “Enforcement” and “Phylyps Trak,” and in its place, studio effects like delay and reverb give the music a cold and distant feel. The forceful kicks of their early tracks have softened, slowed, and been submerged in the murk. The album includes cuts stretching as far back as “Lyot Remix,” their third vinyl single, but in keeping with Basic Channel’s fondness for endless deception, the album is neither a collection of original material nor a chronological anthology of their vinyl singles. Three exclusive tracks—in some cases, heavily dubbed-out versions of earlier singles—share space with truncated edits of EP tracks that originally stretched as long as 21 minutes; one track, a remix of a cut from Carl Craig’s Paperclip People project, has been rescued from the Detroit producer’s Planet E label and retconned as a Basic Channel original. The album’s sequencing reinforces the impression of a descent into abstraction. The rolling, mid-tempo groove of “Q Loop” eases into rippling textures with “Remake Basic Reshape,” where thin tones bounce endlessly across stereophonic space before dissolving into extended pulses of ASMR-inducing electrical noise for the nearly six-minute “Mutism.” The buoyant thump of “Quadrant Dub I” gradually hollows out over the course of the tracks that follow, approaching purely beatless waves of synth on “Presence.” Perhaps “Absence” would have been a better title; the track, like BCD as a whole, emphasizes Basic Channel’s output at its most spacious and minimal. In many ways, the album resembles ambient music, even if they come to the sound by way of Jamaican dub rather than Brian Eno (or, for that matter, the atmospheric sounds then pacifying the UK’s chillout rooms). The brilliance of Basic Channel lies in how naturally they applied the blunted studio techniques of Jamaican dub to electronic dance genres from the American Midwest. Dub innovators like King Tubby and Lee “Scratch” Perry spent the 1970s stripping reggae to its essence, taking Jamaica’s answer to rhythm & blues and reassembling it into new works. Made with massive sound systems in mind, these bass-heavy mixes used studio effects like tape echo, phaser, filter, and spring reverb, trading the band-centric feeling of reggae for a new approach to composition organized around the studio mixing console. “A dub mix is essentially the bare bones of a track with the bass turned up,” critics Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton write in their 1999 history of the disc jockey. “By adding space to a track, what is left has far more impact.” With this simple insight, Basic Channel changed techno forever. Across their initial run of singles, the duo steadily introduced various mixing techniques from Jamaican dub, revealing a new horizon for electronic music’s experimental vanguard. This shift is immediately evident on “Octagon”—anthologized not on BCD but on its follow-up, 2008’s BCD-2—where they slather a metallic snare sample with thick stereo delay, setting a rickety feedback loop into motion that ripples outward across stereophonic space. The dark chords and frenetic synth programming would become a staple of the Basic Channel sound, growing and evolving as their tracks move forward, repeating the same muted tones again and again. It isn’t hard to imagine the pair at the mixing console, manually sliding each fader responsible for the track’s deluge of moving parts. Studio effects, like the Roland RE-201 Space Echo so beloved by dub producers, lend a sense of spatial depth to “Remake Basic Reshape,” where shrill electronics rattle in perpetual motion over a simple kick and bassline. Ostensibly a remix (or, in their words, “reshape”) of a 25-minute epic called “Remake” from Paperclip People (which itself samples Göttsching’s E2-E4), the track exemplifies the way effects color practically every sound on the record. Brassy synth pulses emerge from behind a curtain of reverb on “Presence” to produce what sounds like a whirring engine turbine, while others, like “Lyot Remix” (a second pass through a cut from René Löwe’s Vainqueur project that the pair first reworked as Maurizio), bask in the uncertainty of each sound’s source material. Early synth designers may have once aspired to imitate the timbres of various acoustic instruments, but against a backdrop of widespread sampling practices and increasingly elaborate sound design, Basic Channel venture away from faithful reproductions of canonical synth patches or drum-machine samples in their explorations of the timbral and textural possibilities of dub. Mixes tend to build slowly, shifting and expanding in slight ways that are only evident with extended periods of careful listening. Some, like “Q1.1,” unfold like feedback loops, with effects that steadily rise in intensity as the track smolders and buckles beneath the weight of its moving parts. Others end closer to where they started; on “Quadrant Dub I,” the duo sets a few formal elements into motion before stepping back to let a sequence of clustered tones bob aimlessly in the mix. There’s a symmetry to the way the piece builds and recedes, but it’s distinctly performed by hand, worlds away from the kinds of automated, sequencer-centric phrasing that have long given house and techno tracks their functional cues for the dancefloor. Instead, the pair’s tracks more closely resemble sculptures or time-based installations, encouraging the kind of careful contemplation typically reserved for works in a gallery or museum. Basic Channel was never just a musical project, and to call the duo merely techno producers is to misunderstand their work in scale and scope. Ernestus and von Oswald touched every aspect of the musical supply chain throughout the 1980s and 1990s; before collaborating with Ernestus on projects like Basic Channel and Maurizio, von Oswald got his start as a percussionist with Hamburg’s Palais Schaumburg, an arty Neue Deutsche Welle (“New German Wave”) quartet that he co-founded with the Swiss composer and multi-instrumentalist Thomas Fehlmann in 1980. In 1989, Ernestus co-founded Hard Wax, a Kreuzberg record store that was among the first places in Berlin to import house and techno records from Detroit and Chicago. The pair also established a vinyl manufacturing facility called Dubplates & Mastering, and launched numerous record labels outside of Basic Channel including Chain Reaction, Burial Mix, and Rhythm & Sound. These labels released music from the constellation of artists surrounding Hard Wax, Tresor, and other techno institutions emerging across Berlin in the years following reunification. Ernestus and von Oswald were devoted archivists and fans of Detroit techno long before they ever produced collaborative tracks themselves; their work as Basic Channel represents two perfectionists’ attempt to bring the many sides of their sprawling research practice together on a series of air-tight releases. From the opening moments of their first vinyl single, everything about the project—from its beautiful packaging to the intricacies of the music itself—felt like a deliberate artistic intervention intended to upend inherited conventions and assert their own vision for techno as a kind of modernist avant-garde. The work inspired other producers, like Edward George and Anna Piva of Hallucinator, to experiment with dub techniques. And while Ernestus and von Oswald would release many of the strongest of these experiments on labels like Chain Reaction—the launchpad for a number of celebrated producers, including Porter Ricks, Monolake, Vladislav Delay, and Shinichi Atobe—the Basic Channel name was always reserved for their own forward-thinking work. “My impression is that Mark and Moritz are extremely aware of the difference in boundaries between different genres and styles, and they play with that and work with that,” Piva told Resident Advisor in 2018. “If anything, it's really going deep into each form and looking at the as-yet explored possibilities within it to generate something new.” For all that Basic Channel got right, the project wasn’t without its missteps. Like its name suggests, BCD was a compilation intended for the compact disc format, which allowed the duo to gather 11 tracks together in ways that weren’t possible on vinyl. Still analog purists at heart (original copies of the CD came affixed with a sticker reading “buy vinyl!”), the duo took a chance on the format, presenting their work in a sleek aluminum case that was consistent with the visual language for their singles. But a design quirk of the metal boxes frequently cracked the discs, rendering them unplayable. “Nice idea and great music but flawed case,” a charitable commenter wrote on Discogs earlier this year. “Store the CD separately if you find one not cracked.” Still, the packaging was beautiful and idiosyncratic in ways that were, ironically enough, fairly consistent with the music. Every track feels rough around the edges; feedback loops are as central to the release as any other sonic element, and reverb imparts a sense of space and depth that makes the tracks immediately recognizable in any DJ set. In terms of audio fidelity, BCD certainly isn’t a hi-fi release, but it also betrays the self-conscious use of lo-fi techniques adopted by others looking to achieve a nostalgic, homespun sound. Instead, the album’s fuzzy dub fidelity foregrounds the duo’s emphasis on process; like the pair’s vinyl singles, the compact disc serves as an extension of their creative practice. For much of the 20th century, concerns about audio fidelity were inseparable from the image of the recording studio, where ambitious engineers like Joe Meek and Phil Spector helped recast the studio as an instrument itself. Basic Channel make a similar contribution to global techno, placing the sci-fi visions of artists like Juan Atkins (who famously adopted the word “techno” from the futurist writer Alvin Toffler) within novel studio environments that gave new color and texture to the music. Whether due to their outsider status as international observers, or to some genuine burst of artistic insight, Ernestus and von Oswald recognized a line that could be drawn between the sounds of Detroit, Chicago, and Jamaica. This spirit would extend beyond their work as Basic Channel, overflowing onto labels Chain Reaction and Rhythm & Sound, where they released work from the international artists whose influence they drew on in their productions. BCD marks the beginning of Basic Channel’s efforts to make their singular aesthetic universe legible to outside listeners. For every teenager who wasn’t there in person, who couldn’t tell the difference between Cyrus and Quadrant and Maurizio—whether in record bins or on Soulseek—the compilation offers a way in to the duo’s catalog, which would achieve legendary status on par with the discographies of Autechre and Aphex Twin in the coming years. The same curatorial, archivist spirit that guided their enthusiasm for Detroit techno is turned inward as Ernestus and von Oswald reflect on their own work. The compilation introduces Basic Channel’s singular vision with style and dedication; it’s both a strong standalone and a crucial gateway to the rest of their material.",0,"September 15, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/basic-channel-bcd/
Blur,Live at Wembley Stadium,7.0,Rock,"Blur’s latest resurgence came crashing down at Coachella 2024, where the reunited quartet encountered an audience indifferent and ignorant to the very notion of Britpop. It was a far cry from the crowds Blur found at Wembley Stadium a half year earlier. Early in July 2023, just weeks prior to the release of their comeback album, The Ballad of Darren, Blur played a pair of shows at the iconic London venue, greeted by punters primed to revisit the glory days of Cool Britannia. The cavernous confines of Wembley may have been new territory for Blur but reunions are commonplace for the band. In the waning days of the 2000s, they mounted their first return, regrouping not much later to play a Hyde Park concert aligned with the closing ceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics. Both of these events were commemorated with the release of a souvenir double-live album, as is the 2023 show in the form of Live at Wembley Stadium, which is also accompanied by Blur: To The End, a feature-length documentary chronicling the band’s comeback. Available in a plethora of formats, Live at Wembley Stadium is best heard in its double-CD/triple LP incarnation which contains the entirety of the Sunday show, the second and final concert Blur played during its Wembley stint, a performance that carries a tangible sense of triumph: This is a band eager to commune with its devoted followers. Those listeners were ready to indulge in nostalgia, anxious to bellow “Parklife!” the moment Phil Daniels hit the stage to once again reprise his starring role from 1994. From a certain angle, that’s precisely what Blur delivered, devoting their set to the hits and album cuts that comprise their core songbook. No less than 16 of its 30 songs were also featured on Parklive, the album commemorating their 2012 performance, confirmation that the Blur canon is fairly entrenched. As commonplace as these tunes may be, the music feels considerably different than Parklive, a record that now plays like a jubilant relic of pre-Brexit Britain. Tempos are slower, particularly on such breakneck rockers as “Popscene” and “Advert,” there’s evident gravel in Damon Albarn’s voice, and Blur on the whole seems heavier, thanks in no small part to an added ballast in the rhythm section. Such subtle differences are part of aging; individual bodies change, as does collective chemistry. Blur certainly sounds older on Live at Wembley Stadium than they did on their previous live albums, yet those scars lend poignance to these familiar songs. The erosion in Albarn’s voice diminishes his impishness, adding a sense of empathy to his cultural observations. This is especially true in “Tracy Jacks” and “End of a Century,” songs written by a twentysomething wondering about “getting past 40” and how “the mind gets dirty as you get closer to 30,” now delivered with a wistful air by a singer on the far side of 50. Instrumentally, Blur accomplishes something similar. They still can play “Song 2” with burly credibility yet they seem mightier summoning cascades of psychedelic noise on “Trimm Trabb,” “Oily Water” and “This Is a Low” in versions that feel earthy and elegant. It helps that, unlike many modern live records, Live at Wembley Stadium actually feels alive. Albarn fumbles lyrics on “Beetlebum” and “Country House” and becomes overwhelmed with emotion singing “Under the Westway,” an elegy to London. Graham Coxon’s gnarly guitar runs ramshod over the vocals, while the bass of Alex James careens across the steady rhythms of Dave Rowntree. The quartet seems thrilled by the clamor they conjure and they’re able to channel that energy into the ballads, providing a nervy counterpoint to the middle-aged melancholia that underpins The Ballad of Darren. Where that studio affair offered a long meditation on maturation, the concert setting here prevents extended reflection; there’s a crowd to consider, after all. Blur nevertheless brings the bittersweet pulse to the forefront, particularly in the closing stretch that pairs recent single “The Narcissist” with “The Universal,” a song whose premonition of a numb, narcotized 21st Century has come to pass. That shift in the culture isn’t acknowledged outright but it’s felt, providing a wistful undercurrent on an album that’s a ripping entertainment.

Happy Mondays,Pills ‘n’ Thrills and Bellyaches,9.5,Pop/R&B,"The models are dressed for a 1990 music video shoot, but no one seems to have told them it’d be a Happy Mondays video shoot. To be fair, Happy Mondays appear to have no idea that they’re at a Happy Mondays video shoot either. At least a dozen women in tasteful cocktail dresses gyrate in an empty sound studio as Happy Mondays pantomime a song called “Kinky Afro,” wearing what looks like the clothes they slept in the night before. That is, if they slept at all. The first look Shaun Ryder gives to the camera is so far beyond “hungover” that it’s uncanny, like a still from an I Think You Should Leave sketch 30 years ahead of its time. His fly also appears to be halfway down. The only guy in the band that’s playing in sync is Mark “Bez” Berry, the mascot/dancer/occasional percussionist whose main instrument is himself, except when he starts patting Ryder’s back like a bongo after a model steals his maracas. “Kinky Afro” is all quotables, but the most important line is, “What you get is just what you see.” And what you saw in this video is exactly what you got on Pills ‘n’ Thrills and Bellyaches—a Madchester masterpiece that could only come from the scene’s most functionally booted band. “Kinky Afro” isn’t Happy Mondays’ biggest hit or defining song—that would be Pills’ rhymin’ and stealin’ lead single “Step On,” or the epochal Paul Oakenfold remix of “Wrote for Luck,” or “24 Hour Party People,” their sex, drugs, and on-the-dole anthem, and the namesake of an indispensable 2002 Factory Records magical realism biopic. After the tragic death of Ian Curtis at 23 ends the revolutionary post-punk phase of Factory, Happy Mondays appear in the film’s second act as unwitting insurgents, a signing that propels Factory founder Tony Wilson’s nightclub, the Haçienda, from a struggling warehouse venue to the locus of the ecstasy-fueled rave revolution that’s sweeping the UK. By the end of the movie, the Mondays are comic relief; with Factory in dire financial straits, they take a meeting with EMI, announce that they’re “going for a Kentucky [Fried Chicken]” when presented with a vegetable platter, and never come back. When we see them eating from an actual bucket of chicken, it’s a gag based on the open secret that “KFC” was the band’s code word for heroin. However, “Kinky Afro” remains Happy Mondays’ biggest hit in America. It’s central to the legacy of their third album, which was released on Elektra and recorded in Los Angeles because that was where these guys were less likely to get in trouble in 1990. Then again, maybe the famed Capitol Studios was just a proper compromise; if relative sobriety was truly a priority, the Mondays wouldn’t have also floated Amsterdam and Jamaica as options. By the time Pills was properly released in November, Happy Mondays had headlined Glastonbury, the Oakenfold-led “United States of the Hacienda” tour was a smashing success, and Madchester-lite singles from Jesus Jones and EMF had topped Billboard. American publications attempted to sum up the band’s raison d’être in a few sentences. “The new music is buoyant, almost goofy,” Newsweek proclaimed. “Scrubbed and mellow and often stoned out of their gourds, their Monkees haircuts bobbing...the fashion grafts British football gear onto American hippie glad rags—with a soupcon of the Jetsons’ futurism.” The upstart UK publication Vox singled out that passage from “Stark Raving Madchester” as proof of how poorly prepared America was to meet the Mondays on their own terms. At a 1990 music industry seminar titled “Stars of Tomorrow,” Wilson took an even more antagonistic tack towards the New York audience: “You used to know how to dance here. God knows how you fucking forgot.” It’s hard to tell whether even the most enthusiastic UK rags shared Wilson’s beliefs, or whether or not Happy Mondays were great as opposed to merely infamous. The almost universal critical acclaim that awaited Pills didn’t change the perception that the music was happening in spite of the people who made it (“stupidly excellent,” “against all odds, this is a stunningly good record”). Details about their creative process from the time are scarce, but their drug-seeking habits are well-documented and often played for laughs, whether it’s arranging international opium deals near Marlon Brando’s house or hitting up crack dens in Harlem almost immediately after arriving in New York for their tour with the Pixies. And so, if there was a lot riding on Pills, none of that seemed to get through to Ryder. “It’s hard to tell if the Mondays idolize anyone,” NME wondered, even as the Mondays surrounded themselves with avant-garde idols. Looking at the credits from their initial run, they could be mistaken for cred-conscious bohos trying to transcend their hardscrabble, Mancunian roots. 1987’s Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out) was produced by John Cale, not because it was a particularly inspired stylistic match but because, in Wilson’s cynical view, the halo effect of the Velvet Underground served as a hedge against poor initial sales of their debut. 1988’s Bummed, meanwhile, was an epic grudge match of substance issues—in one corner, the Mondays, newly enamored with ecstasy, in the other, Factory producer Martin Hannett, deep in financial turmoil and various addictions that would end his life at age 42. Ironically, the producer most responsible for Happy Mondays’ enduring critical cachet had nothing to do with Loaded or Unknown Pleasures. Long before he became a Vegas EDM punchline, Paul Oakenfold and partner Steve Osborne were up-and-coming acid house producers who were tapped to do a remix of Bummed’s massive centerpiece “Wrote for Luck,” which they pushed out to seven minutes with the help of an N.W.A. sample (a trick that would be repeated on Oasis’ Be Here Now, one of the few ’90s UK blockbusters even more notorious for rampant drug use). The partnership continued to flower on “Step On,” a quasi-cover of John Kongos’ “He’s Gonna Step on You Again” intended for a 40th-anniversary Elektra compilation that soon became proof of concept for Pills ‘n’ Thrills and Bellyaches. “Step On” only vaguely resembles its source material: The opening piano strokes are swiped from any number of Italo disco songs, the drum loops could pass for New Jack Swing, Ryder’s verse cadence is nicked from “Come Together,” and the most famous lyric is on loan from Steve McQueen. Still, this recombinant approach honors the spirit (if not the politics) of Kongos’ original, which is credited as the first song to use sampling. This approach—stripping down a cover of everything but vibe—also worked for “Bob’s Yer Uncle.” Originally conceived as a take on Fred Neil’s “Everybody’s Talkin’,” Oakenfold insisted the Mondays keep their sinister groove, as they layered the Daktari theme song, snippets from The Exorcist, and assorted porno films. And, once it became clear that Bez was in no shape to contribute proper percussion, Ryder boasted, “We got somebody who I think was called something like Fidel Castro in. Mega.” (His name was actually Tony Castro.) And since this is a band whose previous album, Bummed, was a joke about anal sex, Ryder took some liberties with the lyric, “I won’t let you leave my love behind.” “It’s our version of a Balearic love song,” Ryder told NME, “where we’re talking about fucking chicks up the arse.” This was a statement Ryder gave after 17 years of sobriety; it took him a moment to remember that Wilson had requested “Bob’s Yer Uncle” be played at his own funeral. On past records, Happy Mondays were an inspired post-punk or punk-funk band limited by their technical proficiency. In linking up with Oakenfold and Osborne, the Mondays just had to nail a couple of bars at a time and let the producers piece it together in the studio. Pills begins with a glimmering acoustic strum reflecting their new milieu of casinos, Jacuzzis, luxury sports cars, and private jets. And, in the case of Bez, getting hit on by the star of Pretty Woman and being so loaded he didn’t recognize her. But immediately thereafter, guitarist Mark Day’s snarling, loopy riff mirrors how Happy Mondays actually appeared: misfits who’d swagger into the room, steal your wallet during a bender, and help you look for it the next day. Day runs his signal through an ultra-premium Leslie amp on “Grandbag’s Funeral,” creating an impossible funk rhythm that sounds like Led Zeppelin’s “The Wanton Song” if its title was more truthful. The slide riff from “God’s Cop” sounds like it’s being played with the edge of a switchblade, whereas “Dennis and Lois” just sounds like U2 guitarist the Edge, a soaring tribute to a couple of NYC scene lifers that predates Achtung Baby by a year. While his brother served as the band’s mouthpiece, Paul Ryder’s basslines serve as the body and soul, the mirror image of fellow Factory bassist Peter Hook by putting groove and murk at the front rather than melody. And if drummer Gary Whelan or Bez couldn’t nail their parts (and the latter rarely could), they had no qualms about being replaced by drum machines or loops of their better takes. In other words, Happy Mondays were the only Madchester act that truly envisioned their music as post-punk, or even post-rock, with Pills perhaps the first example of a rock band reinventing themselves as a sampledelic hip-hop act. It’s a link made all too clear as “God’s Cop” lifts the same drum loop featured on De La Soul’s “Me Myself and I.” With a presumably dim grasp of copyright and licensing law, Happy Mondays took full advantage of early hip-hop’s openness towards collage, interpolation, repurposing, and when necessary, outright theft. The hook on “Kinky Afro” was assumed to be a rip from “Lady Marmalade,” but Ryder had an ingenious alibi—he claimed he couldn’t have been stealing from Patti LaBelle because he was actually stealing from John McClane in Die Hard. In some ways, they were ahead of the curve; Ryder bragged about never writing down his lyrics and using music as a loss leader for a lucrative drug racket when Jay-Z was still making money from ’88. “We were giving [ecstasy] away at first, like good drug dealers do. That was good marketing,” Ryder explained, less enamored with the potentially utopian impact of the drug on UK’s music scene than the fact that local police were more concerned about crack and heroin than all-night raves. “We were selling them at £50 a tab, which was a fucking fantastic earner. Bass strings are expensive, aren’t they?” Happy Mondays’ viewpoint may have been more cynical than their peers, but hardly out of step. “The philosophy is simplistic, the politics nil,” Newsweek said of the Madchester scene, which itself was an oversimplification, if not outright wrong. The Mondays were libertines and libertarians, an approach that Ryder might describe as laissez faire, or, in less fancy terms, “Loose Fit.” Pills’ most seductive groove might have been interpreted as a cultural anthem two years prior, but by the time they could afford the top gear they used to shoplift, the Mondays didn’t seem to have much allegiance to “baggy.” “Loose Fit” is Ryder’s philosophical credo rather than a fashion statement, a call to wear life like a loose garment and not to step on anyone’s toes. The most heartfelt moments on Pills are, understandably, protest songs about the reigning political issue of the day, namely: letting Shaun Ryder take drugs in peace. Inspired by a rare instance of Ryder facing consequences at customs, “Holiday” stumbles upon a trenchant take on classist policing: “You don’t look first class/Let me look up your ass.” “God’s Cop” is a sendup of quasi-celebrity bobby James Anderton, who claimed a supernatural mandate to bust up raves. “God’s Cop” is, in some ways, a protest song, but more effective as a parody. Rattling off crude jokes about feminine hygiene and stolen credit cards, the most damning blow Ryder can land makes Anderton sound like a member of the Mondays’ entourage: “Me and the chief got soul to soul!/Me and the chief got slowly stoned!” In America, Madchester remained a curiosity at best, but that’s no fault of Pills. In the same condescending way that innovations in hip-hop or electronic music are described as “the new punk,” the American mags were particularly guilty of comparing Happy Mondays to other guitar bands—claiming that Madchester was the “second Summer of Love,” or the second coming of the Beatles or the Sex Pistols. Perhaps that speaks to the limited imagination of rock scribes, but in the ensuing years, most of the biggest Madchester acts revealed themselves as boomer rock in baggy drag. As for the Mondays, their reputation as a drug band with a music problem became a lot more literal. 1992’s Yes Please! is the sort of album most people encounter through “Worst Flops of All Time” lists before they ever hear it, if they hear it at all. The lore is far more fascinating: an overmatched Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz trying to wrangle a band of active drug addicts in Barbados, the unrealized desire to collab with Bushwick Bill, Ryder selling the furniture at Eddy Grant’s studio to buy crack cocaine and developing a throat infection that left him incapable of recording vocals. While Yes Please! is certainly uninspired and dated, it’s nowhere near the disaster its reputation suggests—a reputation that all but ensures its eligibility to be reappraised as a cult classic, unlike 2007’s truly inessential comeback Uncle Dysfunktional. Ryder and Bez briefly got back into the UK press’ good graces with Black Grape’s It’s Great When You’re Straight…Yeah, a deeply mid-’90s melange of alt-rap and spiritual mumbo jumbo whose title winks at sobriety (not sexuality), even though the collective’s drug regimen was only slightly less intense than the Mondays’. Over the past 30 years, it’s become clear that fame is their greatest addiction. Whether popping up on Shameless or Shaun Ryder on UFOs or I’m a Celebrity…South Africa, it’s been difficult to keep Ryder off television; I’d say his finest role came in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, where he voiced masturbation enthusiast Maccer, a washed-up, bucket-hatted leader of an “extremely baggy” band called the Gurning Chimps. Bez likewise never stopped moving, touring the reality show circuit to pay off tax debts and winning Celebrity Big Brother in 2005. In the time since, he’s been an anti-fracking advocate and an online fitness instructor; it’s unclear whether he actually learned to play the bongos for real. Yet all of these non-musical ventures have likely done more to burnish Happy Mondays’ brand over the past 30 years as a spectacular rave’n’roll swindle. It’s why Pills manages to resonate not just with the laddish electro-rock bands that stuffed FIFA soundtracks in the 2000s, but the Tough Alliance and the Armed, subversive, high-concept projects that toy with perceptions of cultism and violence as much as they act upon them. Or basically any hardcore band that cares a lot about merch drops. The band knew to end on a possibility—that the ’90s could have turned out much differently than they did. After years of trying to establish plausible deniability for Madchester as a scene and a sound, Pills ‘n’ Thrills and Bellyaches closes on a note of peace, happiness, and love with the fittingly titled “Harmony.” “What we need is a big, big cooking pot/Big enough to cook every wonderful, beautiful, trustworthy, lovely idea we’ve got,” Ryder sings over the “Sweet Jane” chord progression, reimagining the Mad Men finale if Don Draper found self-actualization in Ibiza. In 2023’s If We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution, author Vincent Bevins surveyed the mass movements of the 2010s and found a common terminus point—the moment when the ultras arrive on the scene, either leftist punks or football fans who determine the ultimate course towards anarchy or tyranny. Pills ‘n’ Thrills and Bellyaches imagined a third way for Madchester, one that remains eternally alluring for any musical movement trying to balance drugs, thugs, and hugs, all raving under one roof.

Kaytranada,Timeless,7.3,Pop/R&B,"Time was, producers could keep secrets. Samples and drum kits were subjects of intense speculation, while draconian copyright laws pushed crate-diggers deep into obscure backlists. Equipment was expensive and quickly outdated; studio time cost $200 an hour. But Kaytranada arrived in the era of demystified production, with advanced engineering tools and infinite audio libraries mere clicks away. In developing his signature sound, he focused less on discrete elements—his peers could replicate those anyway—than their intricate arrangement. On his 2016 breakthrough, 99.9%, the tempos, syncopation, and layering techniques were Kaytranada’s own, even when the instrumentals and melodies came from elsewhere. By now, you know a Kaytranada beat when you hear one: The drums are foregrounded with a papery rasp, loud but rarely abrasive. His is such a specific trademark that he risked reaching an artificial ceiling if each record was just an iteration of a theme. 2023’s Kaytraminé preempted any stagnation, pairing Kaytranada’s kinetic drum patterns with Aminė’s chatty rhymes, keeping the temperature low while indulging a shared nervousness. On Timeless, Kaytranada builds on the fusion of 99.9% and 2019’s Bubba, spotlighting over a dozen vocalists on a suite of airy, upbeat collaborations. True to form, Timeless is structured and sequenced like a DJ set as finely chopped instrumentals cross-fade into the next. The jazzier numbers, like “Video” and “Stepped On,” have a mathematical precision reminiscent of Kaytranada’s earlier work with Robert Glasper. And while the songs themselves lack big dynamic trajectories, the tracklist orbits around “Drip Sweat,” a climactic fireworks display featuring Channel Tres. The simplistic melody recalls early-’90s claustrophobia, augmented by Kaytranada’s stuttering rhythm breaks. Channel Tres leans into his role as a glowering emcee, directing dancefloor traffic between muttered verses. Timeless is a dance record, but it can be easily adapted for kicking back at home. The busy drum patterns are offset by soft chords and engineering—the whispery snares land like an air conditioner’s muffled rattle. Kaytranada’s touch is also accentuated by a corps of fluttery-voiced R&B stars: Tinashe and Ravyn Lenae are flanked by Canadian counterparts Rochelle Jordan and Charlotte Day Wilson, grounding the electronica with more classic phrasing. On “Still,” Kaytranada’s heavy kicks propel Wilson’s wistful ballad; the rimshots scattered throughout “Hold On” contrast Dawn Richard’s smooth vocals with spiky edges. The intersection recalls a late-’00s moment when hip-hop producers like Dela and DJ Jazzy Jeff were huffing neo-soul’s last fumes, dousing their rustling MPC drums with turntable cuts—a short interim bookended by more decisive movements, condensing techniques drawn from disparate, bygone eras. And that’s what makes a good DJ set—there’s a little something for everybody. On Timeless, Afrobeat rhythms and funk licks are dressed in R&B elegance; Childish Gambino and PinkPantheress meet the lively tempos with alacrity. If anything, the parade of blends and collaborations dulls the record’s highlights. A winking and mischievous Anderson .Paak supplies the album’s most charismatic performance on “Do 2 Me.” Don Toliver echoes .Paak’s vocal register on “Feel a Way,” yet it’s missing the sly intimacy, bogging down the set’s breezy opening passage. An angsty Thundercat duet, “Wasted Words,” is limited to 90 seconds and buried on a bonus disc. Over Kaytranada’s hypnotic shuffle, Thundercat scales into falsetto, lambasting his neighbors (“You need to take that hat off/’Cause your whole ‘fit is trash”) for innocuous offenses. It’s a bit out-of-place on Timeless, yet the moody chords and harmonies are tantalizing in context, exposing a tiny hole in the record’s block-party itinerary. But if Timeless feels slighter than its predecessors, it’s no less assured, its purpose no less profound: to get you moving, even in quiet moments.",0,"June 12, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kaytranada-timeless/
Wilco,,8.0,Rock,"Wilco have been a lot of things in their 30-year career, but they’ve never been an EP band. Where other acts use the format as a testing ground for new ideas, Wilco always performed their wildest experiments on their studio albums, and Jeff Tweedy has historically favored the LP and the lengthy live set as forums for working through big ideas and worrying over deep uncertainties. Their EPs have almost always been promotional tools, whether it’s their short live set for iTunes or the bonus CDs they’ve appended to proper albums. Even 2003’s More Like the Moon started out as a promo for the Australian edition of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot before it received a standalone release. They’ve been dumping grounds for live cuts and leftovers rather than major statements in and of themselves. Hot Sun Cool Shroud ostensibly serves a similar purpose: Wilco culled tracks from recent sessions and are releasing the EP to coincide with this year’s Solid Sound Festival, where concertgoers will have first dibs on exclusive vinyl before it gets a wider release later this year. But this feels like the first time the band has crafted an EP as a coherent statement with the purpose, if not the weight, of a full LP. There’s an intentionality here that wasn’t present even on More Like the Moon, an embrace of the possibilities of the shorter format. They use the medium surprisingly well, establishing and then elaborating on a “summertime-after-dark” vibe (to use Tweedy’s description). It doesn’t mean much to say Hot Sun is the best EP Wilco have ever made, because there’s not much competition. It means more to say that it feels complete, like a haiku. Opener “Hot Sun” practically melts from the heat, guitar notes bending and warping as Tweedy sings about the physical pleasure of sunlight hitting skin. With that sensation comes a nagging doubt, possibly about climate change: “Shouldn’t I be doing something?” he asks himself. “What can I do? What can I do?” These two oppositional feelings sit in the song as equals, not just as things to experience, but to write about. “What’s the word I want?” Tweedy sings, as though concerned he might not fully convey either the joy or the fear. Few artists can break the fourth wall of a song so eloquently without sounding too clever. With summer as a general theme, Hot Sun is structured in two acts, each side of the 10"" featuring an instrumental bracketed by two vocal-centric tracks. In this setting Wilco sound more focused, the songs tauter in their melodies and more purposeful in their arrangements, even when those arrangements seem designed to be disorderly. The instrumentals move by their own logic—especially “Livid,” a collision of reckless post-punk guitars that recalls A Ghost Is Born—but every song makes space for a little bit of noise, a little bit of chaos. Even the relatively twangy “Say You Love Me” has a heatsick quaver as they offer up a rousing, reassuring, aching sing-along chorus that will no doubt sound great at Mass MoCA. Especially for a short EP, there are a lot of different Wilcos on Hot Sun Cool Shroud. There’s Wilco the dad rockers on “Hot Sun,” still figuring out their responsibilities to their children and everybody else. There’s Wilco the noisemakers on “Inside the Bell Bones,” screwing around in the studio. There’s Wilco the frayed worrywarts on “Ice Cream,” wondering how anybody could love them. There’s Wilco the festival organizers, Wilco the migraine rockers, Wilco the country-rock band, Wilco the goofballs, Wilco the Wilcos. To this familiar parade, add Wilco the EP band, elevating a modest tracklist into something much bigger than itself, and demonstrating how they’ve kept in touch with all those different Wilcos for so long.",0,"June 27, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wilco-hot-sun-cool-shroud-ep/
Judy Garland,Judy at Carnegie Hall,10.0,Pop/R&B,"In a photograph snapped on the evening of April 23, 1961, a line of disembodied hands reach out to grasp for Judy Garland onstage at Carnegie Hall. They belonged to a group of men whose allegiance to the star was as passionate as it was fraught; as bound up in their identification with her strength and humor as with the many troubles of her life. Their cohort could only be spoken about in code, and in time, a whole vocabulary emerged to describe them: friends of Dorothy, the boys in the band, Best Judys. To journalists and outsiders they were objects of amusement, if not outright scorn: “the boys in tight trousers,” “ever-present bluebirds,” or as one writer bluntly called them, “a flutter of fags.” What’s most striking about this image is Garland’s responsiveness to the people connected to those flailing limbs. Her eyes are cast downward, reciprocating their gaze, engaging them as individuals rather than an undifferentiated mass. Most accounts of that evening are of a restless and animated audience, leaping out of their seats and swarming the footlights to be closer to the singer. According to one review, the fervor was so intense “you could not tell whether the crowd was clapping, shouting, screaming, laughing, or crying. The sound suddenly had no character. It was just an expression of total approval and acceptance.” “It was, even by the strictest definition, perfect,” Gerald Clarke, Garland’s biographer, wrote of her series of performances at the storied New York concert hall. But strict perfection is at odds with Garland’s enduring appeal. The expressiveness of her voice outpaced its technical merits. Her genius was using a flawed human instrument to communicate something far more complicated than a lovely song sung straight. She approached show tunes and pop standards with such unguarded emotion that they came to seem disarmingly personal, no matter how well-known or widely performed. Despite her music’s theatricality, the scrim separating the person from the performer was unusually thin: the draw of a Garland concert had as much to do with her glamorous presence as her unbridled singing. The mystique of Carnegie Hall was only enhanced by the success of its recording. Judy at Carnegie Hall spent 95 weeks on the charts and 13 of them at the No. 1 spot. It won several top awards at the 1962 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first ever awarded to a woman. It was a record that lived up to the hyperbole of its liner notes and soon was widely known as “the greatest night in show business history.” After a sometimes rocky 1950s, it once again reaffirmed the star power Garland had always possessed, marking the moment when the singer and her audience were in perfect sync with one another; when the peak of her powers as an artist was met with the kind of sustained and unconditional recognition she’d always sought. Though beloved by her audience, Garland was also the subject of decades of ridicule and gossip about her romantic failure, substance abuse, and professional unpredictability. If she didn't have an enduring romantic partnership, she often found love through applause, forming a complex circuit of affection between herself and the public. This was especially true among pre-Stonewall gay fans, who heard reflections of their own perilous lives in the resilience she embodied. To listen to Judy Garland was not only to feel “total approval and acceptance,” but to be recognized for one’s difference and embraced for it too. Born Frances Ethel Gumm in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, the yet-to-be-christened Garland was marked for success at an early age. Thrust into a performing group with her only modestly talented sisters, “Baby” Gumm was quickly singled out by her legendarily awful stage mother, Ethel, as the most likely potential star. The family relocated to Lancaster, California, where Ethel dedicated her weekends to hauling her youngest to auditions. Her efforts paid off when, in 1935, Garland was signed to MGM. Judy’s voice was so outsized and affecting that it could cow bullies into submission; it could telegraph feelings so beyond her years that executives were unsure how to make use of her. She was considered too old to be a child star, too plain to be a glamor girl, and too “fat” to be a sex symbol. MGM’s dedication to policing the young actress’ weight was notorious: hiring spies to catch her eating, pushing unhealthy fad diets, comparing her to an overweight mannequin, and most crucially, putting her on a pharmacy’s worth of pills. From early on, shame defined Garland’s persona. Where the stars of the late 1950s and ’60s would go on to make unguarded teenage emotion central to pop, Garland disclosed feelings that seemed more related to early adolescence. The spur that sets a given track into motion often isn’t angst but embarrassment. It’s present in her earliest numbers like “You Made Me Love You,” which she originally sang from the perspective of a moony-eyed young fan longing for the impossible embrace of her idol, and reaches its pinnacle with “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” a song so naked in its yearning that it feels almost intrusive to listen to. By the time Garland stepped onstage at Carnegie Hall to perform both numbers, she’d grown into her powers but preserved their signature tension. The “triumph” of so much of Garland’s music is of conquering self-consciousness with talent, and in doing so, attaining a freedom unfettered from shame. In 1950, after years of being drugged by the studio and overworked to the brink of psychosis, Garland was effectively kicked out of the film industry. At the behest of her husband, Sid Luft, she pivoted to live performances and reminded everyone what MGM had long exploited her for: the sheer power of her voice. The tour’s success reinstated her in Hollywood, but by the end of the decade, she was in a rough way. Her marriage to Luft was falling apart due to his colossal mismanagement of her fortune, and her health was rapidly deteriorating. Doctors told her that hepatitis would likely leave her incapacitated for the rest of her life. Tellingly, it was news that she initially seemed to greet with some relief, as though it would finally allow her to have a moment’s rest. But after she got wise to the extent of her financial troubles, it became clear that rest was not an option. After a period of convalescence, Garland was able to partially re-generate her liver, hire new management, and get back on the road. Unlike her extravagant shows from the 1950s, Carnegie Hall was envisioned as a straightforward engagement. No circus acts, no cheap thrills, just Judy backed by a 40-piece orchestra. The setlist was a series of highs drawn from every era of her discography, from breakthrough hits (“You Made Me Love You,” “Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart”) to film performances (“The Trolley Song,” “The Man That Got Away”) to mature standards (“Do It Again”) and classics from the American songbook (“Swanee,” “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love”). These were songs that she had lived with and performed over and over again, that had developed a universe of popular recognition and quiet personal subtext. You don’t need to know, for instance, that Garland’s original performance of “You Made Me Love You” prompted Mayer to finally recognize her star power to hear the emotional economy of her delivery at Carnegie Hall, the ease with which she can shade reminiscence with regret. At 13 years old, she was told to sing “Zing!” at her very best because her dying father would be listening over the radio. But understanding that history isn’t necessary for grasping the heaviness beneath the song’s light heart. After basking in the applause, the first sound that Garland makes on the record is a flattered but self-deprecating “oh!” Then she kicks off into “When You’re Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You).” Self-effacement and self-empowerment go hand in hand for Garland: the song is a call to optimism in the face of personal ruin that’s paced like a stand-up comedy routine. Between warbling verses, Garland rattles off a list of troubles that run from petty slights to outright devastation, practically inviting the listener to map the song’s catalog of misfortune onto the gossip cycle surrounding her own personal life. After being deceived, told she looks stout, handed a subpoena, and having her groom get cold feet, Garland sings a mantra for survival: “Forget your troubles/C’mon get happy!” Though that motto may be saccharine, Garland makes its positivity sound like a kind of faith. The attitude of unyielding cheer in the face of collapse, reflective of the musical theater tradition in which she cut her teeth, is like an inversion of rock’s detached cool or punk’s ferocious snarl. But it can be just as defiant of a rejection: a refusal to be diminished by life in the face of mundanity or outright ruin. Garland sums it up multiple times throughout the evening, like in “San Francisco,” where she plays up the melodrama of the original number before the arrangement quickens and she flips it from a dirge into a brassy homecoming. “That’s Entertainment!” elevates the idea to cosmic scale, paraphrasing Shakespeare to sum up theater’s ability to elevate everyday mediocrity into a vast human comedy: “The world is a stage/The stage is a world of entertainment!” From Dorothy’s implacable longing to Esther’s hometown pride in Meet Me In St. Louis, Garland’s appeal was thoroughly rooted in nostalgia. Judy at Carnegie Hall was composed primarily of numbers that dated back to the 1920s and 1930s, which she managed to keep relatively fresh by accommodating elements of jazz and swing into her arrangements. The nostalgia she inspired in the early ’60s was two-pronged: for the Golden Age of Hollywood and the long-lost world of vaudeville, where the Gumm family had gotten its start. That nostalgia was not entirely benign: When critics needed a point of comparison for the young Garland, many reached for vaudeville star Al Jolson, America’s most famous blackface performer. Garland covers two songs popularized by Jolson on Carnegie Hall: George Gershwin’s “Swanee,” which she had also performed in 1954’s A Star Is Born, and “Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody.” In both cases, her pleas to return home to “mammy” have aged as poorly as the blackface she once donned for 1939’s Babes In Arms. But these are the only wrinkles in an otherwise flawless evening, and reminders that the feigned, backward-looking innocence of the American songbook is far more dated than the worldliness of Garland’s singing. After a lifetime of stewing underneath a veneer of perfect poise, Garland developed a razor-sharp wit and self-deprecating sense of humor that would make her a talk show favorite toward the end of her life, even as she was left slurring and glassy-eyed in her seat. Her stories between numbers are genuinely funny, as when she recalls using a safety pin to affix an ill-fitting evening dress for a seated performance at a piano: “I sat down and the pin came undone and into my derrière. I’ve never sung so high or so fast.” On the other hand, the anecdote she tells of a journalist flattering her all night only to publish an article about how fat she’s gotten is hard to laugh off, even as it’s played for comedy. “I’ve spent years and years and years trying to please through singing or acting,” Garland once raged on tape recordings for a memoir that never materialized, “and yet I’ve constantly been written or talked about as an unfit person.” Those tapes reveal the flipside to the concert’s circuit of affection, the life largely not captured on record: of lonely, inebriated nights in far-flung hotel rooms, stone broke and many miles from her children, years of anger surfacing as her battle-honed sharpness dissolves into chemical slush. The most affecting numbers on Judy at Carnegie Hall are the ones where she communicates pain and loss, like the aching way she phrases “The man who won you/Has run off and undone you” on “The Man That Got Away,” or her powerful belting as the song blazes to a climax. In that number and “Stormy Weather,” Garland’s use of dynamics demonstrates her tight rapport with her backing band, allowing the music to swell and recede so that almost pitifully small levels of woundedness eventually culminate into pyrotechnic displays of emotion. “Come Rain or Come Shine” rides a breakneck drum line that becomes increasingly frantic as it’s accompanied by strings, horns, and a relentless ride cymbal, with Garland’s voice growing more ragged with desire the more aggressive the music becomes. By the end of the song, her ferocity is matched by a crowd that won’t stop screaming. “Alone Together” dramatizes its deep weariness and devotion with a pitch-black vortex of woodwinds and strings. Wielding the powerful lower end of her contralto for all of its resolve, and the corroded edge of her vibrato for all of its turbulent emotion, Garland encircles the audience with her passion while conveying a fear it might not be enough to protect them. Later, after flubbing a verse in “You Go to My Head” and gamely carrying on, she hedges her performance of “If Love Were All” by bringing the lyrics sheet onstage for a performance backed only by piano. Garland more than makes up for her caution by how totally she occupies the loneliness at the song’s heart and the despair of its final lament: “But I believe that since my life began/The most I’ve had is just a talent to amuse.” Though their music is quite different, Garland’s appeal is not entirely dissimilar to that of later performers like Elliott Smith or Kurt Cobain, although her scorching honesty is complicated by her need to express herself through the veil of other people’s songs. If those performers gained part of their power from raw disclosures of pain, what animates Garland is an almost unbearable dose of dramatic irony. This capacity to read Garland beyond face value—to sense, for instance, as she breaks down over the hopelessness of her partner’s addiction in A Star Is Born, that she was also talking about herself—also placed her at the forefront of camp. The “failed seriousness,” as Susan Sontag later put it, of a child star who developed a lifetime of trademark tics to cope with the spotlight, has been a boon to generations of drag queens and actresses in want of an award-winning biopic. Though the lexicon of contemporary gay culture is unthinkable without “Judy, Judy, Judy,” the audience who clamored for Judy at Carnegie Hall inhabited a vastly more hostile world than the modern listener. Apart from the brutal policing and social ostracization, the 1950s and early 1960s was a heyday of Freudianism in America, and the profile that emerged of homosexuals as effeminate, repressed, and grotesquely sentimental elicited both patronizing sympathy and flagrant contempt. In a very homophobic article for Esquire in 1969, William Goldman managed to sum up both: “First, if [gays] have an enemy, it is age. And Garland is youth, perennially, over the rainbow. And second, the lady has suffered. Homosexuals tend to identify with suffering.” Though Garland’s death in 1969 on the day of the Stonewall Riots is mythically invoked by some as a driving factor for the rebellion, it actually marked a decisive break between generations. Gay liberation was, to a large extent, about materializing a self out of the shadows. The defiant, often hard-bodied new homosexual that emerged in its wake had no need for Garland as a conduit to express itself or to articulate its political demands. In turn, loving Judy became not only passé but slightly shameful, an activity associated with the most pathetic kind of closetedness: evocative of mothballs, jazz hands, and a deferred life of masochistic yearning. But even as the cult of Garland dipped, it laid the seeds for powerful new affinities to develop between performers and their audiences. In Judy at Carnegie Hall, one can hear the genesis of contemporary queer fandom, in all of its relatability and complicated emotional grappling. Judy’s precipitous highs and lows have gradually been given a cleaner shape by the artists who succeeded her, smoothing out the turbulence in favor of a much more manageable approach to pop as a way of life, whether that be narrativizing a fully-rounded approach to sex and romance (Madonna), sharing moments of shattering vulnerability (Janet Jackson), or performing jazz standards while taking on A Star Is Born (Lady Gaga). Even when the going is rougher, she remains the benchmark for preternaturally gifted performers who persevere despite unthinkable odds: just look at how often her name comes up in discussions of Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston, or Britney Spears. However satisfying it is to see “The Trolley Song” come full circle and get meme’d into oblivion, it’s difficult to imagine a singer today occupying quite the same status for their fans as Judy did for hers. The identification that accumulated gradually around her over decades is now recreated on an industrial scale, virtually overnight, with billions of dollars at stake. It’s no longer just Judy: You can now take your pick of queer singers to stan, or choose from an even larger pool of flamboyant pop girls, gaybaiting boys, and industry-backed “outsiders.” Psychological subtext has given way to a ready-made therapeutic language of overcoming trauma. No public controversy or tabloid trouble is too minor or damaging to create a new album cycle over. This has all contributed to deep cracks in a once iron-clad relationship. Artists are in the awkward position of having to give profuse thanks to fans while also trying to claw back their autonomy from them. Fan service has increasingly become fan deference. At times, it feels like the tail is now wagging the dog: that the purchasing power of gay money—and the sense of entitlement over artists that comes with it—not only dictates the sound of pop music but the character and affect of its performers. That’s part of what makes Judy at Carnegie Hall so moving. The singer’s capacity for openness was met with a proportionate show of gratitude by an audience who could appreciate it for the act of generosity that it was. Her struggles were not their struggles, although both knew the pain of being unable to reconcile the roles foisted upon them with their deeply inconvenient yearning for basic happiness. This is also what makes “Over the Rainbow” such a powerful anthem. The song was talismanic for Garland, and she treated it with a protectiveness that she did not extend to anything else in her repertoire. The lives of Dorothy Gale and Judy Garland were equally fantastic, but time had frozen the former in a fairytale while the latter was left to square her longing with an adult understanding of just how pitiless the world could be. On the record, Garland does not burst into quiet sobs while singing like she did in the 1950s, but she does approach the song’s central emotion with an almost holy reverence. The mature grain in her voice makes its final question feel all the more poignant and heartbreaking: “If happy little bluebirds fly/Beyond the rainbow/Why, oh whyyyy, can’t I-I-I?” Ultimately, Garland could not resolve her unhappiness, but struggled against her limits, yielding a hard-won truth that she bore out in her art. Like Dorothy at the end of The Wizard of Oz, Judy at Carnegie Hall found home: among an audience who loved and accepted her, applauding her for all that she was rather than defining her by all that she lacked.

Leon Bridges,Leon,6.7,Pop/R&B,"Yesteryear has always been a balm for Leon Bridges, the neo-soul singer who first became known for the deliberate revival of pre-Motown R&B on his 2015 debut, Coming Home. With each successive record, Bridges crept further into the modern era, yet his fourth album, Leon, floats in a different plane: It’s a nostalgia trip that disguises its sentimentality beneath its heavily stylized, ultra-polished exterior. Where Bridges previously framed his cribbing from the past as a signifier of authenticity, all the borrowed sounds on Leon are consciously blurry, playing on collective memories of communal good times. When woven together, the enveloping reverb, reassuring rhythms, and tuneful yearning amount to a well-worn scrapbook for Bridges, a vehicle that allows him to reminisce at a comfortable repose. As he puts it on one of the album’s pivotal tracks, he’s in a “Peaceful Place,” enjoying the sweet stillness of a bright, sunny vista. Leon sustains this blissful attitude throughout the album’s succinct 43 minutes. Bridges created its gentle sway in tandem with Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian, a pair of producers who have served as Kacey Musgraves’ chief collaborators since Golden Hour, the 2018 album that earned the country singer the Grammy for Album of the Year. Golden Hour is a blueprint for Leon, particularly in the way refurbished vintage sounds serve as stylish accents on modern pop. Musgraves’ blurring of genres and eras was deliberately amorphous, resulting in music that could seamlessly slide onto pop and country playlists. Bridges attempts a similar trick on Leon. Avoiding anything conspicuously contemporary, he nevertheless winds up with an album that sounds quintessentially modern in that it could be parceled out into any number of settings; it would sound equally at home on playlists designed for morning coffee or late-night chillouts. Bridges pulls from numerous sources, touching upon introspective folk and pulsating pop alike. What unites the album is a pervasive rose-tinted nostalgia that’s undergirded by his unending gratitude. Early in the record, he provides a laundry list of affections on “That’s What I Love,” setting a soothing tone that’s never once broken. He does pepper the record with hints of unpleasantness—underneath its sunny pulse, “Panther City” contains a suggestion of the trouble lurking in the neighborhoods surrounding his childhood home—but his sweet, rounded tone and the softly sculpted settings all lend the impression that he’s left the darkness behind. There’s no grit here, no earthiness: It’s a fantasy constructed out of pleasant recollections and dusty old records. Fantasy can be appealing, of course, especially when it’s conjured with the loving care that Bridges, Fitchuk, and Tashian bring to Leon. Relying heavily on the sun-bleached soul of the early 1970s, the trio paints with acoustic strums, subdued funk, fuzz guitar, glistening keyboards, and, in the case of “Laredo,” jazz flute. None of the songs on Leon sound precisely alike—the sensual slow burn of “Ain’t Got Nothin’ on You” gives way to the longing piano ballad “Simplify,” and the pastoral pleas of “Ivy” slide into the sensuous “Ghetto Honeybee""—but for all its variety, Leon is oddly monochromatic, even a touch insular. Blame it on studio craft so slick that it refuses to let any grit into the proceedings; the arrangements are airless, never allowing space for dissonance or accidents. The tidiness of the production makes Leon feel curiously frictionless. All the emotions Bridges mines in looking back are flattened into another textural element in the mix, a move that results in an album as comforting as a cool summer breeze—and just as ephemeral.

Hana Vu,Romanticism,7.6,Pop/R&B,"Time comes for us all, but Hana Vu is taking it harder than most. “There’s no song in my heart like I thought there was when I was young,” she wallows on the first song of her second album, Romanticism. It’s the kind of lament that a more restrained songwriter might make with melancholic resignation, but Vu doesn’t do quiet emotions: She bellows the line as if she’s been mortally wounded or awoken to find the sun stricken from the sky. She’s not just getting older—the very fabric of her being is slipping through her fingers, and she’s wrecked. On Romanticism, Vu channels her despondence into such titanic pop and gleaming rock that you don’t feel her pain so much as marvel at the magnificence of its display. She sings with an operatic authority that makes even her most hyperbolic assertions land as indisputable truth. “I scream so loud/Because I don’t exist no more,” she writhes over glammy twinned guitars on the album’s rousing farewell to youth “22,” her unrelenting voice prodding the song to a Bowie-esque climax. The irony that she’s still in her early 20s isn’t lost on her, but she has such command over her voice that she really does seem old beyond her years. Her keening contralto envelops the song as if it’s been conjured from an ocean of epsom salt.Just imagine how some of the label A&R in her native Los Angeles might have tried to mold her rock instincts for maximum return: play up the soaring guitars, tie her into a “Gen Z can rock, too” narrative, and perhaps encourage her to throw shade at the state of popular music in interviews. Everybody involved would probably make a mint. Vu’s own vision isn’t nearly so prefabricated. It’s much more nuanced and amenable to the times, a complement to the stately gloom of Mitski, the TikTok sadness of Boygenius, and the alt-rock ear candy of Olivia Rodrigo. For all its insularity—she wrote the album alone and recorded it almost entirely with just one other musician, Jackson Phillips of the dream-pop project Day Wave—Vu’s music is unmistakably a product of this moment.Depression’s unliftable curse hangs heavy over the album. On “Hammer,” Vu pleads for a cure to an ailment her doctor can’t diagnose: “There is no answer/But I want one anyway.” Romanticism’s tone lightens on its more resigned B-side, as tense rock gives way to driftier, dreamier material, but Vu’s malaise never clears, despite her attempts to harness the power of positive thinking. Over a tentative dance-pop pulse, “Dreams” imagines an existence where “it doesn’t hurt to be alive,” while “Airplane” sets a lovelorn fantasy to the buoyant pop-rock of the Killers. A closing suite of three more love songs challenges the core assertions of the album’s first half, suggesting the root of Vu’s anguish might be romantic, not just existential.Vu’s been kicking around the Los Angeles music scene since she was 14, which may explain in part why she carries herself like such an old soul. She also lost a prime chunk of her youth to pandemic, time she can’t get back. On Romanticism, she grieves the past not just out of nostalgia for something that’s been lost, but also trepidation about the future. “Do you remember getting older?/Can you tell me what it’s about?” she sings on “Airplane.” It’s one of the rare moments on the album when she sounds hopeful, as if knowing might take some of the worry away, but of course, nobody can tell her precisely how adulthood will unfold. That’s what makes it so frightening. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Mustafa,Dunya,8.0,Pop/R&B,"The dunya has put Canadian Sudanese singer Mustafa through the ringer. The Arabic word, which means “this world,” has no real English equivalent. The phrase that comes closest to capturing what the term means in Islam might be “the human condition,” which for Muslims is brief compared to the eternal afterlife. Knowing that this dunya is fleeting offers consolation to the faithful who endure its hardest trials: war, poverty, grief. At just 28, Mustafa has been touched by all of the above, and the former poet processes these experiences openly in his sorrowful, searching music. When Smoke Rises, his debut, focused on commemorating the dead. Over flickering production from Frank Dukes, Jamie xx, and Simon Hessman, Mustafa breathed warmth into the contradictions of his Toronto neighborhood of Regent Park, which he’s called a “dreamland and a graveyard.” His seamless fusion of hood idioms and folk vocals turned senseless deaths—like that of his friend and fellow Halal Gang member Smoke Dawg—into tender odes to platonic love. On Dunya, Mustafa widens his sound and the scope of his storytelling, using varied strains of electronic and folk music to explore the worlds within and beyond Regent Park. If When Smoke Rises was a funeral, Dunya is the strange days and years afterward, when death settles into the fabric of life. Mustafa, who’s previously described his music as “love letters to the hood,” spends a lot of time on this record rethinking both the hood and love. The death of his older brother, who was shot and killed in Toronto last year, colors the songwriting, which is more panoramic than his earlier, diaristic work. When he rinses his hands of his hometown on “Leaving Toronto,” a track that quietly stews with rage, it feels like he’s truly speaking to the entire Six. “If we’re burning this city tell me where to start/I’m leaving the things that I said/Last of my friends help me shut my eyes/Oh, I still haven’t slept,” Mustafa sings with chilling reluctance. The city’s ambient violence has disappointed him so deeply that even his appetite for vengeance is diminished. But if the quest for retribution doesn’t go his way, he can make peace with that as well. “And if they ever kill me/Make sure they bury me next to my brother/Make sure my killer has money for a lawyer,” he croons. “Gaza Is Calling” offers another tale of death and estrangement. The lyrics concern a Palestinian friend from childhood with whom Mustafa’s lost contact, and detail the subtle ways Gaza’s ongoing occupation closed the kid off from intimacy. No amount of hanging out, talking, or gift-giving seems to bridge the wall between them. “There’s a place in your heart that I can’t get into,” Mustafa laments as an elegant oud arrangement ripples beneath him, the instrument a subtle marker of their shared connection to the Middle East. Mustafa sounds both devastated and hopeful, a contrast played up by the shifting production, which begins with minimal string and piano melodies and later erupts into a rumbling IDM beat. Throughout the record, Mustafa and his collaborators tether grief and despair to other feelings. The production credits include Hessman, DJ Dahi, Aaron Dessner of the National, and Rodaidh McDonald (Sampha, the xx), who layer the songs with rhythms and textures that fill out this expanded emotional world. Lambent Rhodes and flute melodies flutter beneath the breathy singing of “Hope is a knife.” A looped rap verse, presumably from someone close to Mustafa, repeatedly pops up on “Leaving Toronto.” These arrangements underscore that folk is a roomy and worldly tent; the seamless mixing of instruments like the oud and masenqo with rap drums nod to all the genres and places that inform Mustafa’s style. He’s not a gallivanter pulling from every far-flung locale, like Sudan Archives or Madlib, but he’s definitely a syncretist. The spiritual “I’ll Go Anywhere,” where Mustafa happily pledges to go anywhere to be closer to his god, is as cosmopolitan as a passport: Flamenco claps, a buoyant sample of singing children, and exaltant vocals from Rosalía percolate in the background. Despite its endless hardships, the dunya is a tapestry of sensations and perspectives. Mustafa’s pliant, breathy singing holds all these threads together. His weary rasp can convey distress and concern, as on the elegiac “What Happened, Mohamed?” It can radiate regret and longing, as on the upbeat and nostalgic “Old Life.” Or it can sound warm and playful, the approach Mustafa takes on subversive single “SNL.” Short for “street nigga lullaby,” the song is sneakily about drive-bys and retaliation. But Mustafa doesn’t emphasize action, instead narrating the quiet domestic scenes that take place before the violence, almost as if saving these moments from corruption. “Yelling gang gang gang in my room,” he sings with the sweetness of a parent serenading a child, softening the drill-associated chant. He constantly finds ways to chip away at the numbed hardness of Black masculinity even as he implicates himself in its tragic rituals. In many ways, Dunya is about finding new rituals, better ones, for himself and his peers. The love Mustafa has for Toronto is tougher now, more guarded and distant. “The voices that are cheering aren’t for you, listen closely my nigga,” he warns at one point. These could be the words of a hermit or paranoiac, but in Mustafa’s hands they are invitations—to seek peace, to pay attention, to bear this dunya.

Charley Crockett,$10 Cowboy / Visions of Dallas,7.5,"Folk/Country Reviewed: August 21, 2024 Late last April at a small German beer hall in Queens filled with steins and bolo ties, Charley Crockett took the stage to celebrate the release of $10 Cowboy. Backed by the Blue Drifters, his trusty band by way of Austin, Texas, he played a style of music he calls “Gulf & Western,” an amalgamation of the blues, folk, soul, and country influences he absorbed growing up between South Texas, Dallas, and New Orleans. The New York crowd—unmistakably full of belt-buckled transplants—was captivated, only looking away to two-step. But one look at the man himself and it was clear: Charley Crockett is tired. At the pace he works, it’d be hard not to be. $10 Cowboy and its recent sequel, Visions of Dallas, mark his 15th album since 2015 and his ninth since 2020. Before that, Crockett spent roughly a decade busking across the northern hemisphere. In New Orleans, he learned traditional street songs and was introduced to the hobo lifestyle; in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, he played honky tonks and street corners alongside Leon Bridges and Vincent Neil Emerson. There were stints in Paris, Copenhagen, Morocco, California, and New York City, where he and his folk-meets-hip-hop group the Train Robbers were discovered performing on a subway car by a music industry executive. Their new manager aspired to take the Train Robbers mainstream; Crockett had other ideas, heading to Northern California to work on a weed farm (and traffic pounds of it) until their contract expired. Risky as this move was, it allowed Crockett the time and independence to concoct a vintage country sound that still manages to be forward-thinking. The core of his music pays homage to old-school outlaws—Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and James Hand—but more elastic artists like T-Bone Walker and Link Wray play a role too, attributing to his boogie-woogie and rock‘n’roll tendencies. Crockett’s mix of genres initially confused some country purists, but these roots-driven sensibilities have now situated him alongside contemporary stars like Tyler Childers, Colter Wall, and Sierra Ferrell who are moving the genre forward by looking back. With the $10 Cowboy series, Crockett not only cements that he is one of the most prolific artists in the business, but that he is one of the most consistent, too. Chapter I, the stronger of the two releases, features one of Crockett’s most personal and well-executed ballads to date, “Good at Losing,” a solemn ride-along through the years he spent traveling aimlessly. The title track, “$10 Cowboy,” is another highlight: a slow burner that traces the similarities between cowboy singers and bull-riders, quixotic showmen eking out an existence on the outskirts of society. This feeling, a desire to be seen but a refusal to be known, runs strong through Chapter I. Crockett takes the role of a lonesome traveler who, despite getting kicked around time and time again, continues to stride towards the blurry paradise he believes America still has to offer. The bulk of Chapter II is made up of covers, including renditions of Jack Routh’s “Crystal Chandeliers and Burgundy” and Townes Van Zandt’s “Loretta,” two songs written nearly 50 years ago that still speak to Crockett’s troubadour narrative. Crockett has always done a good job at keeping the classics alive, but the album’s originals lack the punch and narrative depth of Chapter I. “20-20 Vision,” off Chapter II, is led by a simple ragtime piano riff and a whining electric guitar that puts his smoky baritone voice in its natural setting: a dusty bar room. It’s a good track, but, as is the case with much of Chapter II, it doesn’t really weave in his relationship with Dallas. Instead, it’s a song that could be dropped nearly anywhere on his discography. Compared to the intimate showcase of Chapter I, Chapter II comes off more like a grab-bag of Crockett loosies than a true sequel. He’s at his strongest when he writes about the ghosts from his past, battles with redemption and belonging, or pours his heart out for a lover; he retreats to his comfort zone when he falls back on songs about “Trouble and Misery” or invokes casinos as a lasting emblem of false hope in America. Yet throughout both, his conviction and sense of place are undeniable. In the decade it took Crockett to brush country stardom, the bygone era of music he loves and embodies arrived in the modern age. He is a key player in deciding where it will go next.

Ad Choices CN Entertainment","Late last April at a small German beer hall in Queens filled with steins and bolo ties, Charley Crockett took the stage to celebrate the release of $10 Cowboy. Backed by the Blue Drifters, his trusty band by way of Austin, Texas, he played a style of music he calls “Gulf & Western,” an amalgamation of the blues, folk, soul, and country influences he absorbed growing up between South Texas, Dallas, and New Orleans. The New York crowd—unmistakably full of belt-buckled transplants—was captivated, only looking away to two-step. But one look at the man himself and it was clear: Charley Crockett is tired. At the pace he works, it’d be hard not to be. $10 Cowboy and its recent sequel, Visions of Dallas, mark his 15th album since 2015 and his ninth since 2020. Before that, Crockett spent roughly a decade busking across the northern hemisphere. In New Orleans, he learned traditional street songs and was introduced to the hobo lifestyle; in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, he played honky tonks and street corners alongside Leon Bridges and Vincent Neil Emerson. There were stints in Paris, Copenhagen, Morocco, California, and New York City, where he and his folk-meets-hip-hop group the Train Robbers were discovered performing on a subway car by a music industry executive. Their new manager aspired to take the Train Robbers mainstream; Crockett had other ideas, heading to Northern California to work on a weed farm (and traffic pounds of it) until their contract expired. Risky as this move was, it allowed Crockett the time and independence to concoct a vintage country sound that still manages to be forward-thinking. The core of his music pays homage to old-school outlaws—Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and James Hand—but more elastic artists like T-Bone Walker and Link Wray play a role too, attributing to his boogie-woogie and rock‘n’roll tendencies. Crockett’s mix of genres initially confused some country purists, but these roots-driven sensibilities have now situated him alongside contemporary stars like Tyler Childers, Colter Wall, and Sierra Ferrell who are moving the genre forward by looking back. With the $10 Cowboy series, Crockett not only cements that he is one of the most prolific artists in the business, but that he is one of the most consistent, too. Chapter I, the stronger of the two releases, features one of Crockett’s most personal and well-executed ballads to date, “Good at Losing,” a solemn ride-along through the years he spent traveling aimlessly. The title track, “$10 Cowboy,” is another highlight: a slow burner that traces the similarities between cowboy singers and bull-riders, quixotic showmen eking out an existence on the outskirts of society. This feeling, a desire to be seen but a refusal to be known, runs strong through Chapter I. Crockett takes the role of a lonesome traveler who, despite getting kicked around time and time again, continues to stride towards the blurry paradise he believes America still has to offer. The bulk of Chapter II is made up of covers, including renditions of Jack Routh’s “Crystal Chandeliers and Burgundy” and Townes Van Zandt’s “Loretta,” two songs written nearly 50 years ago that still speak to Crockett’s troubadour narrative. Crockett has always done a good job at keeping the classics alive, but the album’s originals lack the punch and narrative depth of Chapter I. “20-20 Vision,” off Chapter II, is led by a simple ragtime piano riff and a whining electric guitar that puts his smoky baritone voice in its natural setting: a dusty bar room. It’s a good track, but, as is the case with much of Chapter II, it doesn’t really weave in his relationship with Dallas. Instead, it’s a song that could be dropped nearly anywhere on his discography. Compared to the intimate showcase of Chapter I, Chapter II comes off more like a grab-bag of Crockett loosies than a true sequel. He’s at his strongest when he writes about the ghosts from his past, battles with redemption and belonging, or pours his heart out for a lover; he retreats to his comfort zone when he falls back on songs about “Trouble and Misery” or invokes casinos as a lasting emblem of false hope in America. Yet throughout both, his conviction and sense of place are undeniable.

Heems,Veena,7.6,Rap,"In 2024—after years of hinting at his struggles in oblique, punny song lyrics and cryptic, quickly deleted tweets—Heems is finally done hiding his trauma. In February, the Punjabi American rapper dropped his first full-length release in eight years, LAFANDAR, rediscovering the joys of rocking up to the mic after years in self-imposed musical exile. VEENA, his second album of the year, takes a clear-eyed look at what dimmed that joy in the first place: the complex PTSD, chemical dependencies, and self-sabotage that dragged him away from the light. Produced almost entirely by Melbourne’s Sid Vashi—whose day job is in psychiatry—this is rap as self-directed therapy. These are not entirely unfamiliar waters. Heems has always interspersed his meta-satirical bars with personal accounts of his experiences with racism in a post-9/11 America. But the struggles that he is processing here aren’t only personal—he’s also tackling the generational trauma left behind by cataclysmic historical events like the 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan, which killed over a million people and turned millions more into refugees overnight. A few decades later, in the 1980s, a separatist insurgency and state repression in the Indian half of Punjab forced tens of thousands to flee the country. In a fractured homeland or as diasporic exiles, everyday Punjabis found themselves living hard lives in hard circumstances. Most of the time, Punjabi families (including mine) don’t like to discuss, or even acknowledge, these psychic wounds. To talk about them is blasphemy, an unseemly airing of dirty laundry. On VEENA, Heems isn’t afraid to go all in. “Only way to process it is write like it’s my mission,” he raps on lead single and album centerpiece “Manto.” The song’s title is a nod to Urdu writer S.H. Manto, the preeminent chronicler of the chaos that accompanied Partition. Over Vijay Iyer’s tender piano keys and a dusty, sepia-tinged beat, Heems raps with an urgency that lands somewhere between the Last Poets’ agitprop spoken verse and ragged punk-rock howl, trying to come to grips with “PTSD for something I didn’t witness.” A lot of VEENA—named after both Heems’ mother and the string instrument associated with the Hindu goddess of knowledge and music—deals with similarly grim subject matter, but it does not wallow in misfortune. Much of the music here is joyous, even exuberant, Vashi gleefully wrangling pop-R&B vocals and lush soul samples next to wavy synths and woozy, propulsive grooves. There are forays into lush, Avalanches-esque plunderphonics and Kollywood-adjacent club rap aimed directly at the hind-brain. Heems raps about surviving addiction and mental health issues with the sort of earnest, unflappable positivity that only comes after a process of painful self-reflection. “Ratatouille” exemplifies this shift toward unmitigated optimism. Vashi speeds up a 1980s Bollywood-esque melody—think lovers dancing in a field in springtime—till it warps into something darker. Midway through the song, Heems rhymes “Ay yo I’m on antidepressants” with “I’m feeling good man, I’m eating lettuce.” A few bars later, he raps, “Life is beautiful, I’m looking at flowers/I’m feeling like I got superpowers.” A pre-2024 Heems might have drenched these lines in irony (or avoided them altogether). But here any incipient corniness is burned away by the sheer intensity of his joy at still being alive. Yet Heems’ signature mix of ironic, smart-dumb humor isn’t entirely absent. He’s just deploying it more judiciously—one of many tools in his arsenal, rather than an all-encompassing security blanket. On “Bourdain,” over a cheeky handclap-and-campana beat, he alternates between transnational flexes (moving from Maine to Spain and Bahrain in a single bar) and insouciant wit (“I’m with 11 killers, that’s my cricket team ya philistines”). “Dame” sends up the hip-hop playboy trope; Heems follows up the sexual undertones of “Now you all wet, [it’s] a mess, and I’m moppin’” with the record-scratch punchline “I can clean your house.” But even the jokes sound like they come from a less cynical, more grown-up version of the former Das Racist rapper—one who’s aiming at something deeper than bratty provocation. Another of the album’s central themes is the healing power of family, human connection, and his community, both in the New York rap scene and the global South Asian diaspora. Heems spells this out with frequent name-drops of his creative peers and in the voice notes that stitch the tracks together. His mother reads out a critique of Heems’ “provincial” poetry, while an eclectic group of South Asian musicians and creatives—including Hasan Minhaj, Arooj Aftab, Riz Ahmed, No Doubt’s Tony Kanal, Bollywood director Zoya Akhtar, actor Danny Pudi, and more—offer messages of love and affirmation. The pleasure of community—of connecting with people who have inspired him, and been inspired themselves in turn—is also evident in the dynamic he shares with his collaborators. On the UK drill-inspired “Rakhi,” all frenetic tumbi riffs and brooding synths, he does a little grime turn—adopting a lower, more menacing vocal register and upping the tempo—before the Punjabi folk melodies and reggae-tinted rap of fellow Queens natives Pavvan and Ajji arrive. On “Flowers,” he drops to a nearly conversational tempo as he lays out his heart, playing the grounded foil to Tamil-Canadian singer-rapper Navz-47’s airy, melismatic arias. On closer “Banshee,” chopped-up samples stutter and strike a pose over a long-legged groove. Heems lists out his close calls—overdoses, jail cells, car crashes, and pumped stomachs—before shouting his defiance at the hand fate dealt him. “I’m done retiring,” he declares, “I’m back!” Then, at this triumphant moment of personal redemption, he hands the mic over to frequent collaborator Cool Calm Pete. It lands as a powerful acknowledgement of the fact that he didn’t make it here alone. It’s a lesson that we could all learn, but especially us Punjabis. Maybe I’ll even play VEENA for my mom the next time I’m home.",0,"August 26, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/heems-veena/
Jake Xerxes Fussell,When I’m Called,8.0,Folk/Country,"Not so long ago, Jake Xerxes Fussell was in a hurry. The son of Southern folklorists, Fussell took his family inheritance—that is, an invaluable intimacy with customs and cultures far beyond the mainstream of his ’90s youth—and immortalized it with his earliest records. Fussell played spirited and relatively faithful versions of rather obscure old songs. Sometimes, he sped through them, though, as if he were some folk-festival stenographer, putting down what he’d heard in his own hand before it was all lost to the future’s sweep. But near the last decade’s end, on his third album, 2019’s Out of Sight, that seeming impatience began to erode, replaced by the desire to transform that inheritance into something truer to his own life and time. With his rhythmically idiosyncratic guitar and his golden mean of a folk singer’s voice, as inviting as a Sunday picnic, Fussell stitched together bits of those old tunes in ingenious shapes. It was as though Fussell finally realized just how much of his source material had made it online, ostensibly digitized forever; that work done, he could now tell his own story by using that source material in his own way and his own time, as slowly as he’d like. Fussell has never been as patient—or, for that matter, as graceful or compelling, curious or inclusive—as he is on When I’m Called, his fifth and best album. Produced by kindred spirit James Elkington and played by a cast that includes Blake Mills, Joan Shelley, and Joe Westerlund, When I’m Called foregrounds Fussell’s ability to take songs moldering in university archives or reissue label stacks and locate another meaning within them, to imagine some new way to interpret that inheritance. Fussell’s field of play is broad here, from a 1994 cassette by Maestro Gaxiola, who turned his life into a sort of anti-industry piece of performance art, to an English nursery rhyme about animals that dates at least to 1744 and may be an allegory for a half-dozen historic events. In conversation with what has come before, Fussell creates a space where our own modern malaises, whether loneliness and anxiety or political instability and social suspicion, feel less like our burdens than those of humanity at large. Fussell finds mostly forgotten songs to sing, less now to preserve them than to connect to a past we still share. Much of When I’m Called is a survey of indecision, or at least of not knowing what is supposed to come next. Most obvious is “Leaving Here, Don’t Know Where I’m Going,” a century-old Georgia lament about needing to part from home to get some work. (Another of Fussell’s folklore mentors, the late Art Rosenbaum, captured it for Folkways 40 years ago.) Framed by gentle acoustic guitar that trickles like a country creek and horns that sound like soul-baring sighs, Fussell’s tragic rendition is an existential wrestling match in slow motion. Why does pursuing what we need so often cost us what we love, like “Alabama water that tastes like cherry wine”? “Gone to Hilo,” meanwhile, sees the forlorn world from the other perspective—the lover whose Johnny has set sail for yet another foreign port to make his wage. That’s just life, but Fussell’s tender phrasing and measured pace feel interminably sad, as if this were the end of a line and a love. A touring musician with his own young family in North Carolina, Fussell seems to step out of his own body and brain here, imagining how it must feel to watch himself leave for adventures that are also just his job. Not good at all, he reckons. The great Robin Holcomb, another Georgia singer who has long mined the past for her own present, softly echoes Fussell, linking this conundrum across generations. Someone is almost always on the move during When I’m Called. That’s Fussell contemplating his own responsibility and, ultimately, mortality amid the title track’s gentle and brilliant electric ripple. He’s waiting whatever turn is his. There’s the meet-cute of “Feeing Day,” a 19th-century ballad in which a gentleman extends his umbrella to a woman stranded in a rainstorm. They share some drinks, fall in love, and, in the classic version, quickly get married. Fussell omits that last bit here, closing instead on a fanfare of languid horns. They curl like a question mark, an ending shrouded in uncertainty. It’s hard not to hear the closer, “Going to Georgia,” as the answer: “They’ll hug you, they’ll kiss you/They’ll tell you more lies,” Fussell sings of men at large, his voice deep and warm, like a father offering advice distilled from his own misdeeds. “And the crossties in the railway are the stars in the skies.” (He inveighs against cads with some of the same lines earlier in the album during “One Morning in May”; if it sounds playful there, it sounds like a real warning here.) Betrayal and selfishness are ancient arts, cosmic even. The best we can do is to canter on, then, just as Fussell and his band do through a final corona of wispy strings. If you spend long enough diving into online repositories, you can find something about most every song Fussell invokes or interprets or recombines here—the complete lyrics of what was then called “Feeing Time,” the bouncy Maestro Gaxiola tape where he lampoons Andy Warhol, even a wobbly file of Virgil Anderson singing that perfect bit about Alabama water, Alabama women, and cherry wine. The sources, then, are mostly safe, so he doesn’t have to be in a hurry to immortalize them anymore. But unless you know what you’re looking for, those antiques are bits of folklorist flotsam locked in an endless data heap, viewed only by the most obsessive and diligent. Reverent and imaginative, Fussell does the work of pulling them out of the pile and making them ring again. No other American singer is repurposing our old folk scripts with so much authority or ingenuity; When I’m Called proclaims—softly, gently, and slowly, with a sly grin and a Southern ease—that what these songs have to say isn’t old at all.

Nubya Garcia,Odyssey,8.0,Jazz,"Nubya Garcia’s simple titles conceal worlds of complexity. Source, her 2020 debut, paid tribute to the British saxophonist’s roots in London jazz and the Afro-Caribbean diasporic sounds that inspired her. Odyssey, the follow-up, is a wilder, more expansive work—a veritable quest of a record sporting ornate orchestral arrangements, meticulously layered mixes, and countless twists and turns. That combination doesn’t always make for easy listening, at least initially. Source was adventurous, but its strong melodic lines and sunny disposition were relatively easy on the ears, helped along by a healthy dose of hip-hop, soul, and reggae. Odyssey is more involved: a mournful, imposing work made up of hundreds of moving parts. At times—such as on the frantic title track, or surging toward the climax of the turbulent opener, “Dawn,” featuring Esperanza Spalding—it sounds like the whole band is soloing simultaneously, a disorienting yet exhilarating experience. “The Seer” feels almost enraged: Sam Jones’ hulking, broken-beat-inspired drums shatter against Joe Armon-Jones’ darkly dramatic piano jabs, Daniel Casimir’s impatient double bass, and Garcia’s tenor, which has the on-edge feel of a headache on a humid afternoon. A pair of calmer songs fill out the album’s midsection, but even these aren’t exactly relaxed, despite the slower tempos. Georgia Anne Muldrow’s quavering vocal melody on “We Walk in Gold” never quite seems to resolve, and the song is charged with the nervous air of a coming storm, eventually building towards an irascible climax. The string arrangement of “Water’s Path” spins and bobbles like a wind-up toy as it picks away at James Douglas’ opulent cello lead. Sometimes this intensity feels deliciously contradictory: In “Solstice,” the band probes the internal conflict between skittish, flustered drums and Garcia’s sumptuous and supremely confident tenor saxophone lead. The contemporary genres that Garcia explored on Source are less present on Odyssey. Jones’ exhilarating drum lines occasionally resemble drum’n’bass or broken beat; “Set It Free,” featuring Kokoroko’s Richie, bounds with the revitalizing spring of hip-hop; and the closing “Triumphance” is, for all intents and purposes, dub jazz. But these are exceptions. In their place are orchestral arrangements whose majestic air brings to mind the symphonic jazz of Kamasi Washington’s The Epic. Much like Washington’s masterpiece, Odyssey requires a degree of concentration, but the album is all the richer for being slow to reveal its hand. New highlights appear with every spin. Consider, for example, how drums and piano play a game of cat and mouse halfway through “Odyssey”; or Garcia’s lush saxophone tone driving the band through an unsettling series of chord changes toward the start of “In Other Words, Living”; or the ever-so-subtle reggae touch underpinning “Clarity.” Another sitting might yield a completely different set of revelations. Odyssey isn’t just full of ideas; it’s full of good ideas—rich, challenging, and inspiring in their largess. A decade into the new jazz boom and seven years on from Garcia’s debut EP, Odyssey shows ambition and style. Garcia has said that she wants listeners of her second album “to feel like their imagination knows no bounds” and she aces this test on a record that is alive with intensity and rich with the luxury of inspiration.

Charli XCX,Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat,8.0,Pop/R&B,"Charli XCX has been a celebrity for a long time, but she’s never been this famous—exposed enough that I don’t even really need to explain what the past few months have entailed for her. The question that’s lingered in the wake of the world-conquering success of her sixth album, BRAT, has been what she’d do with that newfound fame: Unashamedly chase a bag and put her name to a swath of ill-fitting collaborations? Write the requisite fame-is-hard record? Release an album of impenetrable noise? Why not a little bit of all three? Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat is a Rolodex flex and a reckoning with fame and an album that features harsh noise and outright screaming—the platonic ideal of a collaboration-heavy pop remix record as well as one that’s Charli to its bones. Were I a newly minted star who’s spent much of the year performing and promoting and partying all the while, I might take the autumn to recuperate; Charli, currently losing a yearslong battle with workaholism, recorded new vocals for every track here, sometimes overhauling tracks to the point that I’m not sure they’d qualify under Billboard’s rules for remixes contributing to a song’s Hot 100 placement—which is generally the entire reason most A-listers release so many superfluous remixes. That’s a crucial detail of this Brat remix record: It feels less like a way to keep “Brat summer” rolling than an attempt, on Charli’s part, to relocate her sense of self amid the memes, opportunistic co-signs, and critiques, both good-faith and bad. Like its sister album, it is unexpected, unfiltered, uncomfortably messy, and dizzyingly fun. Contained within Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat are monuments to friendships old, new, and repaired (“So I” with A. G. Cook; “Von Dutch” with Addison Rae; “Girl, So Confusing” with Lorde); link-ups with collaborators from songs you might have chosen to forget (Tinashe pops up on “B2B” a decade removed from “Drop That Kitty”); and real-time markers of Charli’s ascendancy (“Guess” with Billie Eilish). Lesser-known names like The Japanese House and Bladee are given just as much space as artists Charli has long admired (Robyn, Ariana Grande) and newcomers, like the young, gloriously bitchy Catalunyan rapper Bb Trickz. On paper alone, the variegated and very unusual guest list is a testament to Charli’s talents as a genre- and scene-agnostic A&R; if the title feels too unwieldy, maybe you can just call it Pop 3. Like Pop 2—the clearest blueprint within Charli’s catalog for a project like this—Brat and… is raucous and reckless, and it’s really really sad. But romantic love isn’t a concern here. Instead, Brat and… siphons off some of BRAT’s primary fuel: the idea that fame is too potent, too damaging, and too deliriously intoxicating for any one person to deal with in a “normal” way. The stakes are far higher now that my mum, your mum, and Ella Emhoff’s mum have all at one point self-identified as “Brat.” Seeing the most famous woman in the world at your boyfriend’s show, it turns out, is not as bad as hearing that your friends think you’ve changed; wondering if you should have a baby is even more agonizing when the album on which you wondered if you should have a baby becomes so successful that the next three years of your life are suddenly fully booked. Brat and… has the aesthetic of a victory lap—Ariana Grande co-sign, monumental first-day streams, weird activation at a bucolic outdoor Hudson Valley art center—but its lyrics are often even more shatteringly bleak than those on BRAT, that album’s many hypotheticals suddenly made viscerally real. BRAT was one of Charli’s few records without features, a fitting mode for an album about how isolating it’s been for her to spend a decade drifting in and out of the mainstream. The guests on Brat and… were seemingly recruited with that sense of loneliness in mind: The 1975’s Matty Healy, Grande, Eilish, and Bb Trickz are lightning rods, forever singled out for their sharp tongues, fat mouths, and tabloid provocations; Bladee and Yung Lean make an aesthetic of alienation; Justin Vernon is indie music’s most enduring avatar of aloneness; Lorde and Eilish spent their teen years surveilled and scrutinized by the public and the media. None of these artists have traversed Charli’s exact path, but they’ve all, in their own ways, had to reckon with their own stardom, their position in the industry, and the choice to chase easy success or follow their muse down the rabbit hole. Rather than fruitlessly try to foster relatability with her audience—who will never be as rich, famous, or exposed as her—Charli writes with surgical specificity, a welcome change from the platitudinal, patronizing I’m Just Like You vibe that’s become de rigueur lately. The flip side, of course, is that these songs do sometimes veer into one-percenter solipsism (“It’s a knife when you’re so pretty, they think it must be fake”) but they feel truthful in their mashups of folly and despair. As ever, friendship is a salve. A simulated phone call between Charli and Caroline Polachek on the diaphanous, wintry remix of “Everything is romantic” is vulnerable and affirming, ominous comedown anxieties (“Did I lose my perspective? Everything’s still romantic, right?”) neutralized by the simple tactility of Polachek’s lyrics: “Late nights in black silk in East London/Church bells in the distance/Free bleeding in the autumn rain.” A. G. Cook’s fleet remix of “So I,” originally an apology and tribute to the late SOPHIE, becomes a paean to “all the good times”: “First time I ever felt alive on stage/In Texas, in matching latex/That’s as cool as I’m ever gonna feel.” Tinashe’s remix of “B2b” is one of the few unapologetic flexes here—a triumphant celebration that’s a welcome relief after a handful of songs that wear their discontent on their sleeves. Partying provides some comfort, too—or at least a fun, fleeting high. Were you one of the many annoying dance music types who complained that Charli shouldn’t have described BRAT as a “club record”? Here’s a positively filthy EASYFUN remix of “365”—endlessly bootlegged after it premiered at that auspicious Boiler Room back in February—that samples Altern-8’s “Frequency.” And, for good measure, a sexy, stupid UKG track, courtesy of wifey, that braids “Club classics” and “365” and a deliciously insouciant Bb Trickz verse into the musical equivalent of one of those confusing but cunty Y/Project button-ups. Should we do a little key, should we have a little line? How about a whole snowplow’s worth? It’s immensely gratifying that Brat and… swerves between modes—sad and hard, quotidian and glamorous—in this way. Pop has been quite boring in recent years, in large part because it’s been easy to predict where its top-tier stars will go next. Brat and… is both diabolically calculated and so off-the-cuff as to seem kind of guileless: ego and id getting caught in a barfight at 3 a.m. Rather than try to fit the expectations of how a pop star should act, Charli has taken exactly the right lesson from BRAT’s success: Nothing about this world makes any sense—so you might as well use your 15 minutes being as uncompromisingly weird as possible.

Polo Perks ,A Dog’s Chance,7.3,Rap,"Atlanta producer-rapper FearDorian first asked to join the NYC hip-hop collective Surf Gang six years ago. It didn’t work out—Dorian was then just 12 years old—but the young artist was undeterred, steadily racking up internet collaborations with everyone from digicore wunderkind d0llywood1 to skater-turned-lyricist Na-Kel Smith. Along the way, he co-produced tracks with Surf Gang triumvir Harrison and began sending beats to one of the collective’s OG members, Polo Perks. Perks and Dorian make a sensible combination on paper, drawing equally from the 2020s SoundCloud underground and mid-2000s Warped Tour-adjacent detritus even as their music moves in different directions. Their union with Milwaukee lowend upstart AyooLii is less intuitive: The 23-year-old rapper’s songs tend to be simpler, better suited for moving asses on dancefloors than solitary listening. But like Polo Perks, AyooLii has never met a sample that scared him, and all three members of the trio work fast. Their new collaborative album is charged with this improvisatory spirit: a brief blast of unruly energy that bounces between 5G towers in New York, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and beyond. On the freewheeling and frenetic A Dog’s Chance, familiar samples twist into endearingly bizarre shapes. Here, a warped fragment of chiptune band Anamanaguchi; there, a snippet of Hawaiian singer Israel Kamakawiwo’ole. Our intrepid protagonists barrel recklessly through these landscapes, rarely hitting a dead end. Thanks to FearDorian’s steady hand behind the boards, A Dog’s Chance manages to zig on even the zaggiest beats. The lowend drums on “BackPack” are layered over a wisp of melancholic guitar; “Skatepark” scans as straightforward sample drill for three seconds until weaving snares snap that anticipation in half. Dorian’s production here cribs heavily from Milwaukee, setting the BPM via 1-and-3 handclaps, and moderately from Surf Gang’s hazy vision of New York drill, pulling just enough from his collaborators’ home turfs to ensure they feel at ease. Yet the defining rhythms of A Dog’s Chance come from nu-jerk, the zany, burgeoning wing of the Gen Z underground that counts Xaviersobased, YhapoJJ, and FearDorian himself among its pioneers. Nu-jerk ostensibly retrofits the drum patterns of mid-2000s California jerkin’ music to modern synth loops—albeit with glitchier snares and blown-out 808s—and Dorian crushes these drums up against unusual palettes and patterns. The lowend/jerk hybrid “They Love Ayoolii” splits open to reveal a Jersey club style break, while Current Joys collab “Rockband Tees 08 Denims” treats Nick Rattigan’s sampled vocals and Polo Perks’ verses with equal respect, a nearly unintelligible mishmash that miraculously gels. A Dog’s Chance stumbles where it retreads ideas. The maudlin “Carissa’s Weird” aims for catharsis, but its fusion of jerk drums and rock sample pales next to the stoic “Breeshwrld.” Oklou-sampling “BackPack” sounds watered down rather than wavy, especially when the atmospheric “Alicia Keys” arrives two tracks later. These songs aren’t bad, but they drag down the trio’s batting average. FearDorian’s idiosyncratic flair is perhaps best understood through the highly recognizable samples heard on “PaperPlanesSoulja” and “Benice2me.” On the former, Dorian twists Diplo and Switch’s flip of the Clash’s “Straight to Hell” into endless rising action, building and building without release; on the latter, Dorian and Quinn chop and screw a fragment of Bladee into a stop-start shuffle. These “cheat code” samples feel tonally distinct from Jack Harlow singing Fergie or Kanye invoking the Backstreet Boys: less concerned with triggering nostalgia than with bringing their source material into the now. The capricious production leavens AyooLii and Polo Perks’ raps, which stray just far enough from their solo work to avoid feeling static. Perks is the more grounded, his fine-grit bark loping forward with metered precision. “Yeah that nigga broke, he get no bread/How you wanna, uh, nigga go head,” he sighs on “Answers,” before craniometrically deducing a woman has good pussy. By comparison, AyooLii’s pinched yelps zip forward like a terrier with the zoomies. “This Glock’ll paint a picture, I’m an art director! Need a bitch with a booty like Ari Fletcher!” he crows on “Pinky.” When playing against each other, as on lead single “Ricky Eats Acid,” Perks and AyooLii find a delirious synergy; on the brief occasions FearDorian steps in front of the mic, his slightly more melodic approach splits the difference between his teammates’ salt-of-the-earth raps and more aerodynamic Auto-Tune flows. And although closer “Left Right” leaves ample room for Dorian and Perks to get in their feelings, most of the tape is sunny and chipper, as if AyooLii burst into the studio and told them to stop dwelling on Midwest emo and touch grass at the skatepark instead. The net result is a breezy celebration of all the small wins along the path of regional semi-stardom. With friends like these, there’s no need to rush.",0,"June 27, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/polo-perks-feardorian-ayoolii-a-dogs-chance/
Zsela,Big for You,7.5,Folk/Country / Pop/R&B,"Zsela’s music is rooted in intimacy, a term that both describes a profound closeness and serves as a euphemism for, well, fucking. In the case of the Brooklyn-based artist’s debut full-length, Big for You, her portrayal of intimacy is firmly the former. That isn’t to say the album isn’t sexy, but that her music retains the tenderness of a blossoming crush and the feelings that swell when you realize you’re witnessing parts of someone that typically remain unseen. Listening to Big for You is a bit like doing that “36 Questions That Lead to Love” exercise with the 29-year-old singer. From the first second of her new record, she introduces (or reintroduces) listeners to her hypnotic, honeyed voice and reels them into mutual vulnerability with each subsequent word. In 2019, Zsela’s debut track “Noise” had a nocturnal beauty to her brooding, contralto vocals, and in 2020, her Ache of Victory EP perked the ears of Sade-worshippers with its memorable lo-fi R&B, including the nostalgia anthem “Earlier Days.” (Zsela, née Zsela Thompson, has a musical pedigree; her father, Marc Anthony Thompson, is the neo-soul artist Chocolate Genius.) Since then, Zsela has chiseled away at her full-length while performing alongside Caroline Polachek, Arooj Aftab, and Cat Power. She once again taps producers Daniel Aged (Frank Ocean, Kelela, FKA twigs) and Gabe Wax (the War on Drugs, Soccer Mommy), resulting in an eclectic, experimental album that straddles the worlds of alt R&B and folky indie rock. The record is an exercise in presence, at times taking in deep pulls of oxygen, at other points folding into lyrical repetition or dropping surprises that leave listeners breathless. Zsela opens the slow jam “Fire Excape” crooning a cappella in her falsetto. Then, over a building funk bassline, she sings that she’s falling in love as day breaks on the fire escape. A moment later, a hose-blast of synths drenches her voice as she finds herself helplessly “falling down” into infatuation. It’s one of the most evocative vocal hooks (and earworms) on the album, and the boingy, sultry bassline brings to mind the more spartan pop-funk arrangements of Prince, combining the remixability of a club track with the hushedness of a coffee-shop confessional. She seems to have found that if you want to be heard in a crowded room, don’t shout—get close and speak softly. The melancholy “Moth Dance” gradually lets out layers of musical fabric; Zsela repeats “I am alive” over and over at its end, finally with a quivering voice, like an affirmation that never really resonated until now. On “Lily of the Nile,” she reveals, in a husky stage whisper, that she “hitched a ride with the bride last night” as though she’s telling you a salacious secret. And “Not Your Angel,” a cheerfully breathy electropop anthem, treats lyrical obstinance as a flirting tactic and evokes the emotive, hook-forward baroque pop of Annie Lennox’s “Walking on Broken Glass.” Some endeavors are less engaging, i.e. the baby-voiced, whimsical “Now Here You Go,” which neither enhances nor shifts the scope of the record. It segues somewhat awkwardly into the spoken-word-driven “Easy St.,” a steamy, abstract mood board of jazz guitar (performed by acclaimed avant-garde guitarist Marc Ribot) and meditation. “Watersprite,” a slow-moving composition, feels indistinct alongside the more rhythmic drive of the record’s first half. Still, at 10 songs in 33 minutes, the album never overstays its welcome. Zsela’s at that special juncture in her career—the one before too many people get in an artist’s head, want a piece of their pie, want a credit in their liner notes—that generates a refreshing authenticity. Big for You captures that rare, fearlessly vulnerable lightning in a bottle. It’s a collection of hymns for those yearning for an “I love you”—or even just a text—back.

KUČKA,Can You Hear Me Dreaming?,6.9,Electronic,"As KUČKA, Laura Jane Lowther makes moody electronic music that flickers with angst and glee. After breaking through as a background vocalist on LongLiveA$AP and cutting her teeth on the Perth, Australia live circuit, she made her name as a singer for club-ready rap and dance tracks. Her diaphanous voice can slink through or float over a mix, a quality that has landed Lowther placements on madcap beats by SOPHIE and Flume, and on mellower arrangements by Mount Kimbie and Andrei Eremin. On features, many of which are uncredited, KUČKA’s singing tends to function more as a texture than as a centerpiece—but in her solo work, she pushes against that reputation.“Absolutely no vocal features,” she declared as she prepared Wrestling, her 2021 debut album. The mostly self-produced record showcased the anguished romantic beneath the ethereal voice, its misty and brooding beats bringing out a sensuality and tension often muted in KUČKA’s guest spots. She sounded less like a manic pixie dream girl—or an “alien, sexy space lady” as regular collaborator Flume once more colorfully described her timbre—and more like a person navigating life’s ups and downs. Follow-up Can You Hear Me Dreaming? has a similarly corrective mission, showcasing KUČKA’s takes on synth-pop, R&B, and dance while emphasizing narrative. If Wrestling was a waking dream, this album is a lucid one. KUČKA again handles most of the production, assisted by Flume, sauna6, and pnkblnkt. The beats vary in style but generally feature crisp drums, crystalline melodies, and lots of negative space. The minimalism somewhat recalls Jessy Lanza and early SBTRKT, but KUČKA’s low ends aren’t as deep, nor are her synth melodies as syncopated. As an arranger, she’s more concerned with clarity than propulsion. Even the brisker songs feel inviting, their breezy arrangements as beckoning as a body pillow. Leaning into this cozy mode, KUČKA structures these songs around stories of intimacy and romance. Opener “Wasting Time (til the end of the world)” centers on a fault that emerges in a relationship as a pair tries to outrun the apocalypse. “We got the music blasting along the motorway/But nowhere left to go/Why can’t you understand?/Look at me I’m serious,” KUČKA sings with irritation. The shuffling garage beat ups the tension; the couple might bottom out before the world does. Other lovers mentioned across the album fare better. The earnest narrator of chippy single “Cry Cry Cry” is brought to tears by the accepting gaze of her partner. And “Heaven,” a minimal R&B track flecked with icy synth melodies and chimes, turns vacation planning into seduction. “Nothing but our sweat and our own skin/We don’t need a week on an island,” KUČKA sings, her voice both pleading and affirmative. She’s not a theatrical singer or a powerhouse, but she understands the inherent drama of a voice stretching or warbling even slightly, and uses such flourishes to make her characters personable. On “Wedding,” a song about being a witness to a shitty marriage, her smug delivery doubles as homegirl intimacy. “Every time he lets you down/On your face I know,” she laments in solidarity with her miserable bestie. Highlight “Not There,” an ode to an absent paramour, offers pure longing. “There’s a craving/In my bones/Subtle aching/When you’re not there,” she sings, stretching “bones” into four wounded syllables. A few concepts don’t congeal. “Can’t Help It” attempts a sarcastic takedown of control freaks (or is it insecure men?), but is tanked by a bland hook and a generic beat that sounds like a throwaway from AlunaGeorge’s Body Music. Flume team-up “One More Night” also stumbles, its mix of heavy bass and airy vocals a retread of their past work. The obvious lyrics don’t help, either: “I’m your addiction now/You can’t resist when I’m around,” KUČKA sings, overexplaining an already cliché metaphor. Both songs sound like the kind of plug-and-play fare she’s trying to distance herself from. “Communal Reverie” and “Gross Body,” tracks featuring her new band PESH, point in more promising directions. For both, KUČKA cedes the mic to her bandmate and wife Dillon Howl, who performs charged spoken word. The buzzy, growling beats practically crackle with energy, the chaos barely tamed by Howl’s witchy and tender verses. Though the songs slot into the overall vision of Can You Hear Me Dreaming?, there is a feral quality to them that could further complicate the image of KUČKA as a twee singer. Imagine it: KUČKA making rage beats for rap sparkplugs Cochise and OsamaSon, or droning trap for Kim Gordon and Fever Ray, or angry industrial for herself. Sounds far-fetched, but there’s a craving.

Naemi,Dust Devil,8.0,Electronic,"Across Dust Devil, a notionally ambient electronic double album, Naemi—a Kansan now based in Berlin—crafts songs that rise and fall gently. Each one has a strong point of view but a brittle feel, like they began as sharp statements before the producer whittled them away to nothing. Indeed, like weather.gov says rather poetically about the tornado-like phenomenon that gives the album its name, each song arrives in a haze and when “depleted or the balance is broken,” “will break down and dissipate.” It’s a soft and magical album, big on ambition and small in scale, which is, in my opinion, the proper amount of each. Naemi, who previously produced under the name Exael, is a member of a loose crew of musicians from Kansas and beyond—most notably Ulla and Huerco S., both of whom appear on the album—working in the more expansive side of electronic music. Expect to hear sweeping vistas of sound, ping-ponging synths, slow laser beams melting across muffled hi-hats, acoustic guitars weaponized into fractal dissonance. These decrepit acoustics share the anti-melody principles of no wave music but not the abrasiveness. The album is quirky, but it’s easy to listen to. Suppleness is part of the approach. Dust Devil is the opus of this sound, with Naemi gathering together a murderer’s row of young experimentalists as featured guests, talented people who dot the Bandcamps of Motion Ward or 3 X L, whose label head, Shy, appears on this album. They perform an array of musical talents, spoken-word poetry, strumming an acoustic guitar, or cooing the sweetest of nothings over beats that gurgle, buzz, and pulse. The album opens with “It Feels So Good” featuring “Erika”—who is also known as the fairly popular R&B musician Erika de Casier; so much more well known is she than the rest of the artists it feels like they thought it would be gauche to use her full name—a hazy sweep of sound. The song could easily have been an instrumental; alone it would be a nice piece of ambient music, made of the gentlest version of something between a baby whale’s call and the digitized sound of a trumpet mixed with a harp-like digital twinkle. But with de Casier’s singing, which she does slow and soft enough that she’s almost whispering, the song turns from relaxing to seductive. Brian Eno could never. “It Feels So Good” is likely the closest thing the album has to a “song.” It’s a smart choice to have it open the album, a proper immersion into the album’s warmth before journeying onto the next 13 songs which blur together as they flit in and out of cohesion. Ideas are developed, actualized, and abandoned. There’s not always a ton of development, but not much preciousness either; curiosity reigns. Despite coming from an electronic music scene, Naemi feels less like a techno producer than a collage artist; imagine an avant-garde take on J Dilla, with crinkles. Texture is substance here; style (or, more specifically, genre) feels largely besides the point. Technically, the production work sweeps between folksy emo (like on the quiet “Day Drifter” with Perila and Ben Bondy’s moody guest track, “Pretty Girl 4K Drone”), trip-hop (the backbeat-heavy “Couch Angel” with Arad Acid and Huerco S.), techno (the anxiously Baeleric “Olivia Prime” with Jason Graf), and an obliterated ambient track that, in principle, is essentially doom metal minus the drums (“Milau” with Zoe Darsee). Tying things together are the tracks’ rise and fall; each fade-out and fade-in arrives quickly, offering a new type of sound but within the same foggy parameters. No sound, whatever its origins, is left crisp. The dust devil brings us on a joyride across the sky before depositing us safely back on the ground. I listened to the album on the subway one morning. I was on the way to therapy and it was a good soundtrack for gathering my splintered thoughts. At Chambers Street, I was up to track nine, “Ambrosia,” a laid-back neo-soul-ish number with what sounds like a live drum kit and soft singing in Spanish by Daniel Rincón, who goes by NAP. It sounds like something David Lynch would love. The doors opened and a lot of people exited and a few entered, including a man playing muffled rap music straight out of his phone’s speaker and two women pushing a rolling cart wearing headset microphones connected to a small speaker, which they used to offer food, juice, and prayer to all who needed. All the subway clamor blended with the music in a way that felt supernatural, snatches of sound burnished with an elevated aura by their transient nature. I didn’t ask for a prayer because I didn’t need one. I’m not saying Dust Devil is holy music, but I’m not saying it’s not.",0,"May 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/naemi-dust-devil/
Jon Hopkins,Ritual,6.5,Electronic,"Getting his young mind blown to Stravinsky while stoned. Making an album to enhance a ketamine therapy session. Releasing two more LPs that pay tribute to tripping on mushrooms and rolling on MDMA. Few artists are as honest about electronic music’s chemical accoutrements as Jon Hopkins, and even fewer can capture those reality-altering feelings in instrumental tracks. His style of techno is shapeshifting and time-warping, with stadium-ready atmospherics and larger-than-life textures. (This is a producer who opened for Coldplay, after all.) Hopkins makes music for people who aren’t necessarily into the club—you could imagine his albums played in a planetarium, Pink Floyd-style, as well as soundtracking the heaving festival crowds where he thrives. Making music for rowdy live performances seems to be the furthest thing from Hopkins’ mind these days. His recent turn to ambient music placed his work in a controlled environment, sealing off the wild abandon of his landmark LPs Immunity and Singularity. Recent tracks with fellow electronic musician HAAi touched on past glories, but on Ritual, his seventh album, he digs his heels in with an ambient-leaning 41-minute composition that isn’t too far removed from 2021’s watered-down Music for Psychedelic Therapy. Ritual is Hopkins’ most epic record, and also the most two-dimensional, honing his thrilling ups and downs into one long build-up and release. Like his last LP, Ritual has its roots in a psychedelic experiment: the Dreamachine, a modern recreation of a 1959 invention that used flickering lights to trigger trippy visuals when users closed their eyes. The latest version is marketed as both entertainment and therapy, and Hopkins is listed on its website as an official composer. Like any kind of product with iffy wellness implications, Ritual is vaguely calming, a particularly elegant Rorschach blob. Are you feeling it? Is it working? What is it supposed to do, exactly? For his part, to match the Dreamachine ethos, Hopkins says that the type of “ritual” the LP is meant to accompany is up to the listener. So, in the parlance of self-care, you’ll have to do the work yourself. Hopkins is joined by a handful of musicians on violin, cello, guitar, and vocals, as well as past collaborator 7RAYS and IDM auteur Clark, but Ritual is pure Jon Hopkins. All the familiar elements are here: hushed coos, the quiet roil of sustained strings, synths that float by and leave vapor trails in their wake. The smooth shimmer conjures Brian Eno’s mid-’80s period, when the ambient pioneer started to stretch out with extended pieces Thursday Afternoon and Neroli. A kraut-y rhythm takes hold—“part iii – transcend / lament” sounds like Stars of the Lid in the studio with Last Resort-era Trentemøller—and the lines between acoustic and electronic are blurred. Eventually the slamming beats come in, though the drums are more like the graceful movements of a percussive troupe than the bone-crunching textures of Immunity. There’s a new painterly touch to Hopkins’ layers of melody and texture. He’s a master at gathering tension, and if you pay close enough attention (or hit the zoned-out sweet spot), the trudge towards climax becomes almost tantric. By the time we’re at “part vi – solar goddess return,” the anticipation is nearly unbearable. An organ-like sound whirrs and you wait for that release—and then it just sort of happens, dissolving into immaterial synth washes that eventually curl around a cloying piano. It’s pleasant, yet hardly the payoff such an extended build-up demands, an Erased Tapes-style facsimile of Eno’s space-travel classic “An Ending (Ascent).” The Eno comparisons are hard to avoid. This music is smooth, classically beautiful, fit for both background and close listening—nothing even an inexperienced ambient music fan hasn’t heard before. It’s a surprisingly safe record given its scale, holding back in its attempt to become a blank canvas for the listener. Hopkins is at his best when he’s lovably melodramatic. Ritual holds down his rock-star impulses and ties the album to a specific time and place, settling for the merely pretty instead of the all-consuming. Richly textured and carefully composed, Ritual is an impressive composition, but for Hopkins it feels rote. It’s like a former club kid settling down to do supervised ketamine therapy. It might do something good for you, but it’s not quite as fun as the unsupervised kind. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Yetsuby,,7.6,Electronic,"Taking cues from ambient pioneer Hiroshi Yoshimura and Studio Ghibli filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, Seoul duo Salamanda conjure vivid fantasy worlds with richly tactile sounds: mallets striking, objects plunking, vocal cords pushing air through pursed lips. Yetsuby, one half of the duo, takes a similarly physical approach to sound in her solo work. But where Salamanda’s music often conveys a sparkling, childlike quality—call it the psychedelia of innocence—Yetsuby’s solo records have often been more chaotic. She twisted up synthetic sounds on 2019’s Heptaprism and leaned toward Two Shell-style overload on last year’s shuddering My Star My Earth. Her new EP, B_B, is her most dynamic and evocative solo release yet. It sounds like a geyser of ball bearings, or a plasticine rainbow, or a marimba the size of a bridge. Both Yetsuby and Salamanda have long displayed ambient leanings, but “Who Swallowed the Chimes at the Random Place,” which opens the EP, is the closest she’s come to crafting something that might be filed within the genre. Softly rounded synth arpeggios bubble expectantly; chimes flicker across the stereo field; jagged streaks of tone occasionally resemble Jon Hassell’s prismatic horn. Still, despite the music’s incidental feel and the absence of drums or melody, the mood is anything but chilled. The moving parts are unpredictable and the placid, new-age tones are offset by metallic bursts and an overarching air of turmoil. The piece belongs to a contemporary strain of hyper-digital music whose organizing principle is gestural in nature, as though Yetsuby had reached into the virtual space of her DAW and smeared the sounds into a shimmery blur. At five minutes long, “Who Swallowed the Chimes” is both the longest and the most formless of the EP’s six tracks. The rest of the record zigzags between streamlined rhythmic studies and maximalist amalgamations of IDM and hyperpop. But no matter the style, a sense of mischief reigns. The brief, percussive “If I Drink This Potion” traipses along at a relatively restrained 112 beats per minute, yet everything seems designed to make it feel faster and more hectic than it is: Drums explode into effervescent clouds, and the downbeat constantly shifts, lending the impression of a frantic jog across liquefying sand. Things settle down on “1,2,3, Soleil,” a 90 BPM head-nodder whose thumping log drums and elastic, dancehall-inspired syncopations could easily pass for a Salamanda track. But Yetsuby can’t resist her habitual impishness: Dappled flute accents soon cede the way to garish splotches of synth, and 32nd-note arps take off like a runaway train, tipping the groove toward singeli’s breakneck gait. Yetsuby is at her most dulcet on “Maxilogue: Potion, Materials,” a sculptural assemblage of chiming synths and sing-song vocoder that gently swells to a full-spectrum climax—dissonant, but somehow soothingly so. She’s at her most intense on “Poly Juice,” piling tiny slivers of sound onto a snapping electro rhythm reminiscent of the early-’00s IDM of labels like Schematic, and topping it all off with sweetly robotic vocal processing. But ultimately, both tracks feel like two sides of the same iridescent coin. On both—and the same goes for the dreamy, Blade Runner-inspired closer, “The Sublime Embrace”—every iota of the stereo field teems with microtonal detail. In Yetsuby’s universe, categories like ambient and club music are largely a question of perspective. At the root of it all is a riot of motion, she seems to suggest: Zoom in far enough on even the most seemingly static object, and you’ll find a field of atoms whirling like dervishes.",0,"June 28, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yetsuby-b-b-ep/
Anycia,PRINCESS POP THAT,6.8,Rap,"If you ever wanted to live a day in the life of an Atlanta cool girl just listen to an Anycia song. That’s been the appeal since last summer when the grainy snippet for “So What” lifted her from a life of partying and working odd jobs (bottle service, babysitter, hair stylist) to a life of partying and rapping. Produced by ATL underground gatekeeper Popstar Benny, the addictive “So What” features Anycia’s raspy-voiced, flirty-with-an-attitude raps over a beat that tosses Ciara’s hook on Field Mob’s hit of the same name into the pluggnb blender. The short visual added to the dreamy seductiveness, as Anycia and her clique—including fellow overnight sensation Karrahbooo—get drunk and turn up poolside; the handheld feel of a GoPro making it seem as if you just stumbled into a random Tuesday night of hers. Less than a year later, Anycia is on a Flo Milli album, coasting in a vintage muscle car with Latto, and teaming up with proven music industry hitmaker Jetsonmade for her debut album PRINCESS POP THAT. Compared to “So What,” which sounds like it was made on the fly as the video suggests, the album is more buttoned up, but the sense that you’re riding shotgun with her through all the drama and excitement of being poppin’ in Atlanta is kept intact. The more laid back, the better. Cruising over the generic yet smooth g-funk groove of “Bad Weather,” trickling in little details like “I’m in the Lamb’ tryna’ put my lashes on.” On “Nene’s Prayer,” wishing the worst on an ex (“I hope your barber push your shit back/I hope you get up out the car and then your phone crack”) over one of those breezy beats a Detroit rapper uses when they want to be a family man all of a sudden. Her relaxed, monotone recalls a wide array of hangout flows: The haze of Dom Kennedy, the easygoing stunting of Tony Shhnow, when Gucci or 50 do some sweet talking. But a delivery as low-key as Anycia’s relies so heavily on beats. They have to be a vibe, or else her same-y flow can wash over you. Jetsonmade is not the guy for that. The South Carolina native is a malleable, trusted hand, who is decent at booming, minimalist instrumentals that give big personalities the space to do their thing. That worked just fine on DaBaby’s “Suge” or Jack Harlow’s “Whats Poppin,” big hits that I would not lose any sleep if we left them in the pre-COVID days forever. But with Anycia, too much weight is on his production, and it’s too dry and derivative to handle that. (It’s worth noting that all of his beats have three or four other producers credited, but his producer tag gets the star treatment.) For example, the steel-drum bounce of “Call” just makes me want to fire up the summer anthems on Trapnificent. Jetson’s mid-aughts trap revival on “Back Outside” is solid, but is blown out of the water by other recent beats in the same lane such as Baby Kia’s “Od Crashin’” or JT’s “Okay.” On paper Anycia and Cash Cobain seem like a good match because they both are masters of sexually charged, locally-minded, lifestyle rap, but it’s not dirty enough and the airy instrumental lacks the sauce. When the beat is right, Anycia is a fun rapper. “I fuck yo’ nigga to Detroit-type beats,” she jokes on “Type Beat,” over a thudding, serviceable instrumental by Jetson and his team. (Only thing worse than getting cheated on, is getting cheated on while a Teejayx6-type beat is on in the background.) She’s outshined by the punchier Karrahbooo on their bouncy back-and-forth “Splash Brothers,” but Anycia’s insults are still venomous. The album standout is “BRB,” a lush single where everything in town seems to be getting on her nerves; the girls copying her, the guys in her messages: “Blowin’ up my phone I know yo’ baby mama whack.” It’s the perfect Anycia song: Low-stakes, short enough to be a snippet, rapped as if she’s unimpressed, possibly even burdened, by her Atlanta cool girl status.",0,"May 1, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anycia-princess-pop-that/
X,Smoke & Fiction,7.7,Rock,"Billed as the band’s final album, Smoke & Fiction is a fulfilling closing chapter for X, the pioneering band whose breakneck rhythms and turbo-charged rockabilly riffs came blazing out of Los Angeles’s nascent punk scene in the late 1970s. Forty-four years after their debut, 1980’s Los Angeles, the group sounds vigorous and assured, finding fresh inspiration in familiar sounds, emotions, and ideas. Chaos was central to X’s appeal in the early days. The intertwined lead vocals of John Doe and Exene Cerevenka suggested that the one-time couple were embroiled in an ongoing argument; guitarist Billy Zoom added to the frenzy, though he never forgot the swing of early rock’n’roll, even when chasing after the velocity of the Ramones. Inherently empathetic to the needs of his singers, drummer D.J. Bonebrake provided a steady anchor—though he, too, could occasionally get caught up in the band’s feverish excitement. The band thrived on tension, channeling interpersonal drama and clashes with the culture at large into a potent songbook that sustained them decades after they stopped writing new material. In 2020, following a succession of lineup changes, hiatuses, and reunions, the group unexpectedly returned with the sharp, lively ALPHABETLAND, its first album of new material from the original quartet in 35 years. The focus and urgency of Smoke & Fiction makes ALPHABETLAND look like a dry run. Part of that stems from the palpable sense that the band can feel the clock ticking away. Frustrated that they were unable to tour ALPHABETLAND, which landed in the early days of the pandemic, and keenly aware of their advancing ages—Cervenka and Bonebrake are pushing 70, while Doe and Zoom are over that line—X chose to re-run the play one more time. Teaming again with producer Rob Schnapf, who also helmed ALPHABETLAND, X knocked out Smoke & Fiction in a few days this past January—a working band working in the method that suits them. (To underscore the impending sense of finality, they’ve dubbed their new tour the End Is Near.) Clocking in at 28 minutes, roughly the same length as Los Angeles, Smoke & Fiction sounds as if X is drawing inspiration from its long history, purposefully recalling the kinetic rock’n’roll of the band’s early records for Slash. As Doe explained to the Los Angeles Times, “It’s not in our nature to reinvent things. We have a clear idea of who we are.” As robust as they sound, Doe’s and Cervenka’s voices show signs of wear, while the rhythms feel heavier than in the past, even when the tempos quicken. These elements lend natural grain to the music, adding depth to the tales of aging that riddle Smoke & Fiction. Doe and Cervenka are fascinated by the passage of time, accepting the present while being cognizant that the old days don’t seem as far away as they actually are. Those yesterdays are explicitly celebrated in “Big Black X,” a joyous recollection of the band leaving decaying Hollywood for a life on the road, a journey that takes them from “A big black X on a white marquee” to “A tiny little x on a white marquee.” There’s the desire to “get in trouble again,” as the pair sings on “Sweet Til the Bitter End,” with the realization that they’re in the process of—as they put it in another song—“Winding Up the Time.” But the prospect of the end doesn’t haunt the band. Rather, they seize the chance to create a righteous noise one last time, still getting a kick from turning country two-step into punk, or adding dusty, cinematic accents to hard-bitten urban tales like ""The Way It Is.” Listening to Smoke & Fiction in the same sitting as Los Angeles or Wild Gift, the lasting impression isn’t how they’ve changed over the years, but how much of their original spark they’ve sustained. No longer frenetic or hungry, X have nevertheless maintained their intrinsic interpersonal chemistry, drawing strength from the way their voices collide with a relentless backbeat and three simple chords. It’s a simple yet powerful pleasure that gives Smoke & Fiction its kick, along with a surprisingly emotional resonance. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

SML,Small Medium Large,7.8,Electronic,"There were no rules at Enfield Tennis Academy. The tiny Los Angeles cocktail bar, with its specialty in avant-garde jazz and a name that winked at David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest, dodged any accusations of snobbishness by cutting out the usual strictures: no two-drink minimum, no ban on talking or cell phones, and for a while at least, no cover charge. ETA became a destination for the new jazz scene’s westward migration from Chicago to L.A.; a weekly improv session led by Tortoise and Isotope 217 guitarist Jeff Parker was the highlight of the schedule, and a phenomenal recording of those shows, 2022’s Mondays at the Enfield Tennis Academy, finally let the world know what was happening in the cramped back space of that long, narrow club. But despite its momentum, ETA officially shut down at the end of 2023, closing another chapter in the history of West Coast jazz. It will take a long time to uncover the full extent of ETA’s influence on the L.A. scene. So let’s start now, with SML, a new quintet who recorded their debut album, Small Medium Large, across four nights of longform improvisation at the venue. The group represents the next wave of jazz artists to hit the western shore: saxophonist Josh Johnson, synthesist Jeremiah Chiu, and guitarist Gregory Uhlmann are all Windy City transplants. Bassist Anna Butterss arrived in L.A. from Australia via Indiana, while percussionist Booker Stardrum was drawn there from his native New York. (Butterss and Johnson also happen to appear on Mondays at the ETA). They take their cue from an important record on Chicago’s International Anthem imprint, Makaya McCraven’s 2015 album In the Moment, on which he cut up and remixed live improvisations to create a fusion between jazz and hip-hop. SML shares McCraven’s method but not his style; rearranging their concert recordings in their home studios, the group crafted a set of songs that drives like Afrobeat and drifts like kosmische. The post-production technique is sometimes identifiable—the ultra-fast loops of “Switchboard Operations,” for example, belong on a classic Oval track—but the fervent energy of the live performance shines throughout. “Three Over Steel” begins with nine or 10 seconds of a reverse tape effect and then plows ahead with an undeniable groove. This is either live jazz or a facsimile too good to spot, right down to the way Uhlmann’s guitar solo picks its way through delicate one-note stretches while the audience holds their breath. At other times, the degree of editing is irrelevant. “Dolphin Language” is a new-age wash of ambient synthesis more remarkable for its calm, aquatic atmosphere than for any display of chops, whether on an instrument or a DAW. Of course, McCraven didn’t invent the cut-and-paste approach. In 1969, producer Teo Macero edited Miles Davis’ In a Silent Way by cutting down 40-odd reels of 2-inch tape into a sleek 38 minutes, combining live performance with studio manipulations for the first time in a jazz context. SML are intimately familiar with this history, as they prove on “Industry,” a funky number in the vein of Davis’ Macero-produced On the Corner. Over Butterss’ and Stardrum’s chugging rhythm, Johnson plays his sax in short bursts and then solos with himself, either through deft editing or impossible dexterity. Later in the track, Chiu’s synth takes off like a rocket in homage to Herbie Hancock’s spacier voyages. Herbie is there too on “Feed the Birds,” a synth-led interstellar journey (the birds are fed, presumably, on the way up). The band soars through clouds of the starstuff that Chiu’s keyboard emits, with Uhlmann’s guitar spiraling out in fractal patterns over the NASA-precise rhythm section. Referring to the post-genre turn that McCraven and Parker initiated, McCraven has called the word “jazz” “insufficient, at best, to describe the phenomenon we’re dealing with.” Small Medium Large might signal a new iteration of jazz, or it might not be jazz at all, or it might not matter. At the very least, it represents the thrilling next phase of a vibrant L.A. community that, for a decade now, has only moved from strength to strength. ETA may be gone, but SML is here, and hopefully to stay. Correction: An earlier version of this review stated that the venue was named Enfield Tennis Academy; the actual name was simply ETA.

The War on Drugs,LIVE DRUGS AGAIN,7.9,Rock,"Even in the band’s ramshackle early days, the War on Drugs’ music could change the dimensions of a room. They didn’t achieve this feat through sheer volume alone (though songs like “Show Me The Coast” or “It’s Your Destiny” could reach intimidating decibel levels) but through scope: enormous emotions peeking through the curtain of incandescent synths and droning guitar. They made hanging in a dingy rock club watching four wiry Philly dudes conjure a multicolored squall feel like standing on the edge of a cliff, the universe roaring in your ears that you’re smaller than you think. When the War on Drugs grew to a sextet to bring Lost in the Dream’s variegated haze to the stage, their sound pushed against the rafters of thousand-cap venues, fully realizing the kind of immensity music writers love to call “stadium-sized.” LIVE DRUGS, the band’s first live album, collected soundboard recordings from 2014 to 2019, focusing on cuts from Lost in the Dream and A Deeper Understanding. Four years later, they’re back with LIVE DRUGS AGAIN, sourcing takes from their 2022 and 2023 runs. Like its predecessor, LIVE DRUGS AGAIN feels like a single show, one where you lucked into the perfect spot in front of the soundboard, awestruck by a band that exudes the ineffable combination of tour-tight and casual. LIVE DRUGS AGAIN is an expansion in many ways: The band added multi-instrumentalist Eliza Hardy Jones in 2022, and the set draws heavily from 2021’s shimmering prairiecore opus I Don’t Live Here Anymore. It’s even more painstakingly assembled—Granduciel stitched this version of “Under the Pressure,” for example, from six different performances. Here, the music doesn’t smear together into a beautiful mass like the sound of the War on Drugs of yore; instead, it builds into a towering, complex structure. This new, seven-piece configuration of the War on Drugs plays with remarkable patience. There’s a newfound—or at least newly emphasized—attention to the interlocking rhythms that bolster the songs’ swooning Heartland core. Granduciel’s solos aren’t as jammy as in the past, trading the minutes-long shred sessions for a more measured take on hypnotic maximalism. The band assembles “Living Proof” brick by brick, starting with sixteenth-note guitar strums, then adding eighth-note hi-hats, syncopated bass drums, and that hooky keyboard line that hovers in a fog of reverb. It’s almost techno-like in construction, meticulously building tension and ending in a quietly cathartic payoff when the groove downshifts into its roots-rock coda. During some songs, you can pick out one element—the dusty Linn Drum backbone of “Burning,” Dave Hartley’s motorik bassline during “Slow Ghost”—and follow it like a single stream into a tremendous waterfall. The most surprising inclusion on LIVE DRUGS AGAIN is “Come To The City,” a Drughead favorite from 2011’s Slave Ambient. On the album, Granduciel sounds as though he’s singing from the eye of a hurricane, a buzzing cloud of overlapping chords threatening to consume him whole. Live, the band plays like a slowly darkening sky, adding a new layer every few bars until it becomes a colossal, undulating mass. The ambient intro unfurls for a full minute before Robbie Bennett’s triangular piano figure emerges from the haze, and Granduciel sings like he knows what’s coming, the desperation of the studio version replaced with weary wisdom. After dipping into a couple of gorgeous guitar solos, each preceded by a signature Granduciel “Woo!”, the outro sends it skyward. Jones and Granduciel harmonize on the repeated phrase, “I could leave it all,” as the band adds another chord to its structure, giving the droning churn a tinge of hope. It’s a near-perfect distillation of the cosmic, psychedelic Americana that the War on Drugs has been honing for the past 15 years. In press photos and liner notes, Granduciel is the face and catalyzing force of the War on Drugs. But what LIVE DRUGS AGAIN proves, more than LIVE DRUGS, and maybe more than any of their studio albums, is the band’s force as a symbiotic unit. During an extended opening vamp on “I Don’t Live Here Anymore,” Granduciel lovingly introduces the members (save Bennett, whom he refers to as an “international rock icon” at the end of “Come To The City”), singing their names or peppering in an esoteric inside joke. When the whole group finally launches into the stadium-sized anthem, it feels like it’s existed forever, pulled whole from the ether by an ensemble connected via telepathy and MIDI data. That energy exchange seeps out into the audience, each song becoming an act of communion. As Granduciel sings “You’re on your own” near the end of “Harmonia’s Dream,” the crowd begins to cheer, refuting his words, celebrating that they’re all in it together.

Alan Sparhawk,"White Roses, My God",8.0,Rock / Electronic,"At Le Guess Who? festival in Utrecht last November, Alan Sparhawk performed in a church to a congregation that was clearly there to pay its respects. It was the Low guitarist and singer’s first European show since the passing of his wife and lifelong bandmate, Mimi Parker, just a year and six days earlier; the Minnesota band had been booked to play the Dutch festival in November 2022, until her worsening ovarian cancer forced the cancellation of their remaining tour dates. At the Jacobikerk, the pews spilled over as Sparhawk and a band including his son, Cyrus, performed loose but raging rockers that were piercingly direct in their invocation of Parker’s death, panic attacks, the limits of hope, and the damnation that might as well follow. I have never been to a show where the audience was so clearly on the same emotional wavelength—nearly all of us crying audibly, for Sparhawk and for the tangible loss of a stalwart, often holy-sounding voice that had likely guided many present for some part of the preceding three decades. I wondered how it must feel for Sparhawk to be confronted by this outpouring, which felt like an understandable response to the intimacy of Low’s music and public persona, as two beloved artists who were also models for long-term romantic and creative partnership. It seemed at the same time that our unearned catharsis could be almost a burden pressed upon him—one intense hour paling in comparison to a new and unwanted life of dislocation. Indie rock has been struck by a devastation of comparable records in recent years: Sufjan Stevens, Nick Cave, and Phil Elverum have all stared unflinchingly at bereavement in its transcendent awfulness, shocking mundanity, and gradual revelation. But for whatever reason, Sparhawk chose not to make those raw, extraordinary new songs part of his first solo album following the conclusion of Low, which he has said could only ever be him and Parker. White Roses, My God is more primordial than that. It contains his earliest complete attempts at self-expression after her passing, using basic electronic equipment, originally purchased for Cyrus and his older sister, Hollis, to find a new voice and with it go beyond language. “Sometimes, something would come out that I could not stop and I could not mess with,” he told The Guardian. There is a sense in which White Roses, My God is shocking. Its sound is blown out, staticky, inhuman, like Kanye at his most desolate and grasping or SoundCloud rap at its blurriest. Giddy and distorted and impish, like 100 gecs’ wacko tricksiness. Trappy and disjointed and possessed of some feverish, questing energy beyond listeners’ full comprehension, like Kim Gordon’s solo albums, also made after a huge midlife rupture. Sparhawk’s voice is always mutated by a Helicon VoiceTone pedal, rendering him a goblin droid capable of sounding unsettlingly menacing and just as unsettlingly innocent, and rarely coherent. The album sounds nothing like Low, and certainly nothing like the received wisdom of how a record about the loss of one’s life partner should sound, with scarcely any bare-all lyrics akin to what Sparhawk sang in Utrecht. But then when did Low ever conform to the expected? Sparhawk and Parker greeted the birth of Hollis with “In Metal,” from 2001’s Things We Lost in the Fire, in which they longed to keep her “little body in metal” so that she might remain forever unspoiled and protected: not a sentiment you’re about to find on a new-baby greeting card. It is strange to look back just over a decade ago, to the bafflement and near-indignation that met the band’s 27-minute “drone not drones” set at Minneapolis festival Rock the Garden in 2013, which they later explained was a protest at the Obama administration’s “targeted killings” in the Middle East. Where fans might have craved their benedictions in the violence of the Trump era, Low instead met it with furious distortion on 2018’s Double Negative, and doubled down on 2021’s HEY WHAT, the mutant noise perhaps also evoking a more personal kind of malignancy. You could hear Sparhawk’s machine music as an embodiment of the way loss can make its bearers feel abject and monstrous, caught between the living and the dead, but his evident trust in the freedom that these tools offered him feels more like spiritual necessity. It feels akin to André 3000’s New Blue Sun, some kind of hopeful venture beyond definition and into a new frontier of possibility; or simply rising to meet the disorienting intensity of a moment, as Low always did. He told the New York Times that it was Parker’s voice that completed a song; you could imagine how not sounding like himself stepped in for that kind of externalized green light. The only palpable note of defiance is “I Made This Beat.” The mutated Sparhawk repeats the title over and over, at first burbling, then blaring and stuttering, the drily thrumming synths and ticklish percussion growing closer and more aggressive. The phrase evolves from the literal surprise at having finished a song to a kind of godlike fervor at having resuscitated the inanimate. White Roses, My God often sounds rudimentary, seemingly happy to dwell in presets (the credits simply cite “synths”). It’s far from the formal reinventions of Low’s final two albums made with producer BJ Burton, but it is viscerally inventive within its closed sound world: snaking, slurred, and often anarchically fun. There are a few would-be pop songs here with their own gripping dramatic arcs: “Get Still” is woozy and lurching, the sudden divine blasts of Sparhawk’s voice and Hollis’s wordless call (and how uncannily she sounds like Parker) breaking open the song and funneling the slurred instrumentation towards sharper definition. “Can U Hear” trades in darker textures, a glitching wind battering a harsh, grinding motif, Sparhawk’s language so crushed by distortion that it becomes just another rasping texture before it breaks free to wail across the abyss. “Brother” is the only song to feature Sparhawk’s guitar, a rare moment of familiarity: here a clenched, repeating figure dappled with flickering light, then eventually cracking open as Sparhawk and Hollis, Nona Invie, and Leah Sanderson sing a chorus that crests and slumps: “Watch and wait.” It’s one of few comprehensible lyrics. The record comes, surprisingly, with liner notes that reveal what Sparhawk is singing, though given how obscured most of his words are within the music—he’s said most of them were free-associative—it feels academic to parse them too closely. There are flashes of the gospel, Jesus and the Devil; blood, bait, and carrion. Most frequently, he’s suspicious of idealism and saviors, fact-agnostic propagandists, anyone afraid of “the pause that’s hidden and raw,” a line he rolls around his mouth like a marble on “Not the 1.” “Black Water” is a footworky hurtle with a subtly sleazy, almost Nine Inch Nails-worthy motif; here Sparhawk urges, “Let not hate and fame set the clock,” and also slips out: “I’m not the face that make sad.” Whether his theme is grief or something more outward looking, he’s clearly resistant to the convenience of preordained roles or glib narratives in lieu of sitting with difficult truths. The clearest and most coherent parts of White Roses, My God are the more fragmentary, mantra-like songs, in which Sparhawk reaches towards the unknown—and which also seem to be the parts most closely aligned with Parker. “Heaven,” he sings on a beautiful, scrap-like song of the same name, is “a lonely place if you’re alone.” His daughter’s wordless voice swoops around a juddering, fizzing beat as he asks: “Are you gonna be there?” “Feel Something” comes off like the opposite of “I Made This Beat,” desperately searching for sensation amid numbness: “Can you feel something here?” Sparhawk asks a dozen different ways, his voice plaintive, fragmenting, lonely, ultimately so tightly compressed it almost squelches as he palpates for an emotional spark. There’s something almost carnal and funky to the bounding keys that’s a gutting contrast to the robotic, desperate vocals. In the wake of Parker’s death, Sparhawk has not only made this album and the songs he premiered at Le Guess Who?; he’s also formed the funk band Damien, with his son; another funk outfit called Derecho Rhythm Section, which features both his kids; the Neil Young covers act Tired Eyes; and the noise-rock band Feast of Lanterns. Next year he’s releasing a collaborative album with Duluth bluegrass group Trampled by Turtles; he plays on the new Father John Misty record. He’s everywhere from refined concert halls to neighborhood bars. Anywhere might become a church, a diffusion of spirit that might connect; the momentum keeps that spirit alive. His relentlessly propulsive new album only ever pauses for breath once, on closing song “Project 4 Ever,” another that seems to hold Parker in its groovy, cosmic boy-band weirdness. (“I have wanted to wake you with everything I could be then,” he warbles.) The tension of the record breaks, and a vast, sparkling deluge floods the song. It’s beautiful and subsuming, resonating with the lure of the void—how easy it would be to give in to pain and darkness. Then it tapers to a static echo, and Sparhawk’s voice returns, urging forward motion: “On and on and on and on.” White Roses, My God won’t be for all Low fans, and though—perhaps as with the strangely comparable posthumous SOPHIE album—its reception will certainly be softened by goodwill, it stands alone. Sparhawk releasing a record this immediate and inchoate feels like a gesture of faith, in both listeners’ patience and the musical futures it might yet bloom.

Peel Dream Magazine,Rose Main Reading Room,7.3,Rock,"In the middle of “Lie in the Gutter,” a track near the end of Rose Main Reading Room, Joseph Stevens and his collaborators in Peel Dream Magazine slip into a trance state. A vibraphone softly repeats an eighth-note figure, vocalist Olivia Babuka Black coos a wordless phrase, and syncopated guitar plucks bounce off a pulsing bassline. It’s all held together by a muted but propulsive motorik beat. This isn’t new territory for the band—beginning with 2018’s Modern Meta Physic, Peel Dream Magazine have taken cues from bands like Stereolab and Pram, exploring the ways that rigid, droning repetition can make time feel rubbery. As they snap back into the present, Black sings, “Millions of light years, all of them ours.” The past and future fold into themselves, braided together in perpetuity. Like a scientist collecting data, Stevens travels through time throughout Rose Main Reading Room, Peel Dream Magazine’s fourth album. His observations have him spider-webbing through questions of identity, experience, and perception. Though he now resides in Los Angeles, Stevens grew up just north of New York City and lived in Brooklyn for many years. The album was inspired by recollections of childhood trips to Manhattan and, as an adult, days off spent meandering through the borough’s storied landmarks. A theoretical alternate universe might contain infinitely looping versions of Stevens sitting in the New York Public Library or wandering around the Museum of Natural History, each holding the weight of a specific private era. When Stevens returns to those personally sacred parts of the city, as he does on “Central Park West,” the record’s dreamy second song, those former selves appear like leaves in the fossil record, offering clues to who he was and who he has become. Stevens’ songwriting is fascinated with cycles. Tumbling, Philip Glass-like woodwinds mirror the rhythm of a rote morning routine; lyrics montage together a hand grabbing keys from their place on a counter, a comb running through hair, an arm sliding into a coat. On “Recital,” Stevens recounts the ritual of piano recitals as a youngster, describing delicate details in both present and progressive tense. The songs students play are always different, but the same people show up each year; the same sense of adolescent shame and embarrassment hangs in the air. In nearly every song, melodies switch between keys or guitar, previewing the notes Black or Stevens will sing later. Everything repeats but never duplicates; each revolution forms not a clean circle but a spring that contracts and expands. Peel Dream Magazine records have always worn their influences on their sleeve: Modern Meta Physic mined the velvety drone of early Stereolab, Agitprop Alterna referenced early-’90s shoegaze, and Pad’s swinging orchestral pop took cues from Van Dyke Parks and Burt Bacharach. Rose Main Reading Room is another stylistic shift, but rather than set his sights on some bygone era’s gentle psychedelia, Stevens reaches back into his own catalog. Luminous synths provide the cushion for overlapping Steve Reich mallet work; bits of noise hover around a song’s edges like lazy flies on a humid day. Stevens and Black sing in their inside voices, as though careful to avoid a librarian’s shush. The reference points are easy to identify—“I Wasn’t Made for War” feels like a sativa-scented Belle and Sebastian tune, “Four Leaf Clover” could be a lost Yo La Tengo B-side—but it’s a distinctly Peel Dream Magazine sound, gorgeous and glowing, each track slowly blooming like a fruiting mushroom. The album closes with a mantra. Over a shuffling slacker beat and a waterfall of chiming tones on “Counting Sheep,” Stevens advises himself to let go and find peace in the current moment. “Stop counting sheep,” he repeats, “don’t worry.” What existed yesterday will exist tomorrow; stressors or joys will change shape, but their discovery will always feel new.

The Alchemist,"Heads I Win, Tails You Lose",6.7,Rap,"Gangrene are here to crack brains like they were blown speakers. So says Oh No near the top of his fourth collaborative album with the Alchemist, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose. The Oh No–produced highlight “Oxnard Water Torture” slides in on a bed of drums, cymbals, and haunted-house organs, a hazy backdrop he runs into the gutter. “This ain’t your Moët, this Olde English,” he says with a Joker-like snarl, his verse all harsh dissonance and razor edges. Alchemist follows up with more nimble flows and surreal writing: He’s the android with a sniper scope, hopping out the reclining Recaro seat at pinball velocity. Back together for the first time since 2015’s You Disgust Me, this dueling-stoner-dragons approach is a perfect distillation of the mud-caked shit talk the duo inaugurated with 2009’s “Acts of Violence.” Heads I Win oozes with menace when it taps into this frequency, but nearly as often, it loses some of that grime, coming off a touch too clean for its own good. Prolific doesn’t begin to do justice to this pair’s respective catalogs—last year, they dropped nearly a dozen projects combined. As Alchemist has parlayed his indie-rap mini empire into placements on Travis Scott and Drake albums, Oh No has churned out wonky psychedelia with underground stalwarts like Elzhi and Tha God Fahim. Gangrene remains the space for them to get their hands dirty, trading sludge balls with the laidback giddiness of a true-school weed cipher. Everybody needs an outlet for low-stakes fun, and at its best, Heads I Win plays their still-developing contrasts against each other well. On “Cloud Surfing” and “Just Doing Art,” Alchemist’s fixation on surreal elegance—all Lamborghini races and smearing enemies’ blood on canvases—slots decently with Oh No’s blunt threats and metaphors (“Y’all ain’t solid, just some snakes sittin’ low-low/They will find you on the side of the wall like plate sticker logos”). They still sound like they enjoy rapping about rapping together, even when they’re worlds apart. But when I press play on a Gangrene song, I expect not just grimy beats, but grimy beats that sound tailor-made for the duo. Several tracks on Heads I Win are missing the distinct Gangrene rawness, and it’s not a welcome change. Sometimes they’re a little too silly, like the Saturday morning orchestra sample at the center of “Dinosaur Jr.” or the chintzy interpolation of the Inspector Gadget theme song on “Watch Out.” Others sound like leftovers from non-Gangrene Alchemist projects: “The Gates of Hell” has the same kind of maudlin loop heard on his This Thing of Ours projects; “Just Doing Art” and closer “Muffler Lung” sound like they were pulled from the Bo Jackson and Haram folders, respectively. That isn’t to say these beats are bad, just that they don’t fit the project’s ethos. Stacked next to “Espionage” and “Magic Dust,” which do scratch that itch, they illustrate how Alc’s prodigious output is beginning to blend together. Aside from “Watch Out,” Oh No largely sidesteps this problem. In front of the mic and behind the boards, the Oxnard, California, native routinely supplies Heads I Win its filthiest moments. On opener “Congratulations, You Lose,” his slinky keyboards and farting synth line inspire him to use his enemies’ beards as Swiffer mops. Here and over the skipping drumline and sour horns of “You Should Join the Army,” he sounds vicious and hungry. Even when the beats get a bit homogenous, Alchemist and Oh No’s verbal chemistry is still airtight. Hearing them flex just for fun while playing vocal double-dutch over peppy drums on “Royal Hand” is as engrossing as early career highlights like “Gutter Water” and “Flame Throwers.” It’s one of the few times on this album when the vintage Gangrene sound feels forward-thinking, too.",0,"April 30, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gangrene-heads-i-win-tails-you-lose/
Kurious ,Majician,6.7,Rap,"This year marked the 30th anniversary of A Constipated Monkey, the warmly regarded debut of Kurious, a Cuban-Nuyorican rapper from the Upper West Side. A bulletproof album on the merits, it owes its historical significance to a stacked production roster, with early work by the Beatnuts and Dante Ross’ Stimulated Dummies outfit. Kurious had established himself as a freestyle maven in appearances on Stretch and Bobbito, but A Constipated Monkey’s local hits—neighborhood anthems “Uptown Shit” and “Jorge of the Projects”—never caught on beyond the five boroughs. Dissatisfied with his contract at Columbia, Kurious failed to deliver a follow-up. By 1998 he was working at a tutoring center in the Bronx, his recording career seemingly behind him. Kurious fielded a call from fellow major-label castoff Zev Love X, who was putting finishing touches on a self-produced project credited to a masked alter ego, MF DOOM. An evocative, untitled duet made the final cut of Operation: Doomsday, introducing Kurious to the internet’s nascent community of underground rap fans. Subsequent DOOM collaborations—2003’s “Fastlane,” 2009’s “Supervillainz” and “Benetton”—allowed Kurious glimpses of cult stardom that had eluded him as a headliner. That’s Rhymesayers’ bet with Majician, a set of unearthed material workshopped by Kurious and DOOM during a series of 2016 reunions. (Born in the UK, DOOM grew up on Long Island but was never granted American citizenship; he was denied re-entry to the U.S. from 2010 until his death in 2020.) Though he’s listed as an executive producer, DOOM doesn’t appear to have actually composed the music—all 15 tracks are credited to New York producer Mono En Stereo—which makes for a rather strange homage. Between Mono’s dreamy samples, engineer Eddie Sancho’s sludgy mixing, and Kurious’ spare, inflected vocals, everyone’s doing his best impression of the late legend. Easter eggs abound, including a vintage Mr. Fantastik verse on “Par for the Course.” Majician is something akin to an officially licensed tribute. These songs might’ve been compelling enough on their own. On “Eye of Horus,” Mono loops a spare piano and kick drum, centering Kurious’ hard-nosed rhymes and succinct imagery. The spiky guitar, full-bodied horns, and breakneck pace of “Unknown Species” recall past glories, with Kurious’ verses supplying ’90s pragmatism to contrast the ’70s stylings. He’s unafraid to indulge nostalgia, holding forth in extemporaneous bursts and meeting Majician’s upbeat instrumentals with raw, instinctive energy. The free-associative technique works when the tempos are sprightly and spirits high. A sparkplug in his prime, Kurious’s sensibility bordered on Redman and Grand Puba’s, and “Barry Gibb” and “Separation Anxiety” prove he’s still a consummate shit-talker. But with tracks approaching four minutes and hooks in short supply, there’s a lot of space to fill. Kurious sticks largely to monosyllabic rhyme patterns on “Tis the Season” and “Cow’s Eye,” failing to compensate for the plodding grooves and muted percussion. He approximates DOOM’s rhythmic contours on “Untainted,” right down to the pauses between bars, but his wistfulness curdles into kids-these-days grumbling (“It was drugs and murder then, but MCs was neutral/From the hood reporters, nowadays they shooting you”). If DOOM’s masterworks are an unfair standard, Majician cribs the format with half the breadth of vision. “Bacalao Opera” and “Majical Journey” are framed like narratives, but in lieu of plots or characters Kurious defaults to scattershot musings and genuine head-scratchers (“Gentrification cool, but it’s fucked up”). As an article of DOOM apocrypha, Majician is a victim of its own expectations, sacrificing the lively humor of Kurious’ best work and falling short of Madvillainy’s loopy brilliance. Kurious is rooted to the asphalt—he doesn’t need to chase ghosts. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Ayra Starr,The Year I Turned 21,7.6,Pop/R&B,"Before Ayra Starr even turned 21, she had already graduated college, signed with the powerhouse West African label Mavin, and dropped her debut album, 19 & Dangerous. Her second LP, The Year I Turned 21, is the next chapter in her pop stardom storybook. While 19 & Dangerous spotlit an angsty Ayra jaded by toxic, past relationships, TYIT21 captures a Grammy-nominated Starr fixated on getting the bag. This new Ayra might be dripping in designer, but there’s an underlying vulnerability that grounds her. Not straying far from her signature sound, Starr’s well-curated album explores introspective depths and thankfully journeys beyond feel-good anthems. In the lead single “Commas,” the Beninese Nigerian singer-songwriter credits her success to God, radiating a gracious spirituality that floats through the album. Money is a recurring motif: “To be real I’m still eating off my last hit,” she raps breathlessly, then lets the words settle into the gospel-tinged choir of “Bad Vibes.” What initially sounds like a flex suddenly feels existential. Starr’s reflections on money bounce between moments of gratitude, reminders of the hustle, and an insatiable desire for more, painting a far richer picture of a young woman grappling with adulthood. On “1942,” she stammers, “I don’t wanna lose”; the worry feels especially palpable when Milar, Ayra’s brother, interjects that he’s scared he might “lose it all” one day. The line hints at insecurities Starr might hesitate to voice herself. Here lies the driving force of TYIT21: the fear of everything you’ve worked for suddenly vanishing into thin air. Turning 21 is both a milestone and trope, but Starr’s portrayal across the record feels refreshingly complicated, filled with contradictions and uncertainties. She sparkles on “21,” a heartfelt meditation that wrestles with the weight of self-definition. The woozy ballad thrives in its dreamy simplicity, allowing Starr to explore the lush textures of her voice; breathy croons and spoken word morph into full-bodied belts. Her musical alchemy makes R&B’s flow and Afrobeats’ rhythmic pulse groove in unison, rendering her voice a natural fit for more traditional ballads. It’s an internal monologue between youthful optimism and being comfortable not knowing it all. “21” fades on the soft refrain of the word “22,” a chilling lullaby turned cosmic nightmare. Despite her undeniable growth over the last two years, Starr’s words still read like a diary. This album basks in the greenness of youth. From the violin-guided opener “Birds Sing of Money,” Starr puts up an IDGAF front, spitting, “I don’t watch my tone cause I like how it sound bitch,” a cheeky swerve from her softer, rose-colored lyrics. “Lagos Love Story” is an Afropop sugar rush that revels in the thrill of a young romance—the kind of love that leads to impulsive promises after a day of smoking weed at the beach (“Let’s make babies, we’re still young but I dey ready,” she proposes). Three tracks later, Starr has prematurely declared her “Last Heartbreak Song” in a duet with Giveon. Who’s going to break it to her that this is only the beginning? There is a palpable maturity, however, in the production of her sound. While staying true to her earlier Afro-fusion works, TYIT21 taps into dancehall, Nigerian highlife, and amapiano, demonstrating an expanded range, restraint, and purpose for Starr. She tones down the Afro trap and EDM beats of her debut, opting instead for summery melodies, log drums, and acoustic guitar licks, even as she navigates more serious themes. Nigerian Pidgin and Yoruba are sprinkled throughout, alongside her love of proverbs, a mission to popularize Nigerian culture for Gen Z’ers across Africa. The features are also well-matched, with Starr’s buttery vocals melting into those of her collaborators, like Asake and Seyi Vibez. In the sabi girl bounce “Woman Commando,” Anitta and Coco Jones adapt to complement her alté style, rather than outshine her. On the bonus track “Santa,” with Rauw Alejandro and producer Rvssian, Starr contributes to a growing movement of Afrobeats and reggaeton collabs. The invited guests here feel like intentional curatorial choices, showcasing her versatility as an international star. Turning 21 is weird. You’re not a kid anymore, but being an adult feels like playing pretend. With your twenties also comes a lingering twinge of regret, in which you doubt whether you’ve done enough before hitting this “landmark occasion.” It’s a clumsy era of navigating newfound changes while dealing with the pressure to be somebody. Closer “The Kids Are Alright”—dedicated to her late father—opens with a voice note from Starr’s mother: “I want you to be happy…Enjoy what you worked for. Don’t save, save, save…because your dad did not really enjoy what he worked for. He was always pleasing people.” The Year I Turned 21 suggests holding onto the freedom of your salad days isn’t so bad. Maybe adulthood can afford a touch of teen spirit.",0,"June 6, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ayra-starr-the-year-i-turned-21/
Office Culture,Enough,7.7,Rock,"The double album is enjoying a cultural revival lately, a defiant rejoinder to attention-deficit audiences hooked on shortform media. The bug is contagious; over the last few years, artists as varied as Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, and lo-fi iconoclast Cindy Lee have leaned into their expansive impulses, pressing-plant delays be damned. Still, I never expected Office Culture to partake in this maximalist tradition. The Brooklyn soft-rock project, led by writer and musician Winston Cook-Wilson, the kind of guy who gets quoted in trend pieces about millennials embracing Steely Dan, hit its stride on 2019’s A Life of Crime and 2022’s Big Time Things, wonderfully out-of-time albums that thrived on a certain quixotic intimacy. With Cook-Wilson’s suave voice, melodic talent, and affection for sophistipop elegance guiding the way, they were small-scale albums about big-time things; self-contained releases that seemed designed to be enjoyed in one sitting. But as anyone who’s read his reviews (including for this website, where he has been an occasional contributor) can attest, Cook-Wilson’s musical interests extend beyond a certain constellation of soft-rock classics released between 1975 and 1988. Enough is the proof. It’s a 73-minute double album that swaps Office Culture’s jazzy stylings for sample-speckled art-pop and nocturnal brooders, replete with guest spots and stylistic left turns. The lurching, distorted rhythmic inkblots that open “Hat Guy” signal that this is a new kind of Office Culture record; once the track settles into a loungy funk groove, though, with Cook-Wilson crooning self-effacing vignettes about a love gone stale, it’s clear that the band’s songwriting acumen remains very much intact. The singer drew influence from what might ungenerously be called CD-era bloat—those sprawling, 70-plus-minute discs from the ’90s and early aughts, loaded with genre-mingling ambition and an anything-goes spirit. That explains why Enough is so wide-ranging, and why it has a more pronounced hip-hop, electronica, and trip-hop influence than the group’s past work, with wobbly beats underlining the falsetto hooks of “Imabeliever” and a reggaeton rhythm coursing through “We Used to Build Things” as it shifts from programmed beats to live instrumentation. It also explains why the remarkable lead single “Counting Game” opens with grainy loops that seem transplanted from a late ’90s Massive Attack B-side before morphing into a spectral duet of sorts between Cook-Wilson and fellow Brooklyn singer-songwriter Alena Spanger, who intones random-seeming numbers more eerily than anyone has reeled off digits since Philip Glass’ Einstein on the Beach. Another tie to CD-era nostalgia? Enough is the first Office Culture release that works best as a headphones album, its arrangements bubbling with curious, disembodied samples and off-center backing vocals that are only discernible upon close listen. “Around It” seems like a relatively sparse mantra of love and belonging, but listen with headphones in a quiet environment and you’ll catch all these counter-harmonies and eccentric vocal snippets whirring about in the right channel, as though the song were being remixed in real time. And if not every experiment lands—if “Imabeliever” strains Cook-Wilson’s vocal range and “Beach Friday” feels a little too fussily arranged and cheesily prone to nautical metaphors—maybe that also fits with the theme of CD-era bloat, of not holding anything back. Enough seems to be a breakup album, though not the self-pitying kind, and not the embittered, scorched-earth kind either—that’s not this band’s style. Cook-Wilson is more prone to wry, wordplay-inflected interrogations on where it all went wrong and why. “Where I Can’t Follow” movingly evokes the pain of sensing a partner drift apart from you, with Charlie Kaplan’s supple bass licks anchoring Cook-Wilson’s bummed prognostications (“You’ll go somewhere/And I won’t follow/I can’t follow you”). Meanwhile, the six-minute centerpiece “Open Up Your Fist” is heavier and stormier than anything Office Culture have done before, with lyrics that probe a relationship’s demise like a courtroom drama (“Sit back and let me hear it/I’ll close out my defense/This is the background we cast the good times against”). And the disarmingly wise ballad “Was I Cruel” flips its titular question into a stirring meditation on guilt and forgiveness and how easy it is to mistake cruelty for honesty in a doomed relationship: “I can’t believe destructiveness felt that much like truth,” Cook-Wilson sings. The song is surprisingly theatrical—not in the hokey, showtunes-y sense, but in its knack for detail and emotion, how easily you can imagine one character crooning it to another in a scrappy off-Broadway show. Where previous Office Culture albums were charmingly insular, Enough buzzes with a sense of community, situating the group within a larger sphere of hyper-literate and jazz-loving New York musicians. With its myriad guests, the album makes Office Culture feel more like a loose collective than a clearly defined band. Spanger returns to sing lead on the sputtering, mournful “Secluded”; the Bird Calls (aka songwriter and former Pitchfork staffer Sam Sodomsky) gets a spotlight on the title track, a nostalgic elegy; and Jackie West (whose recent LP Close to the Mystery has marked her as another ambitious Brooklyn songwriter on the rise) wrings plaintive melodies out of the jazzily disheveled “Everything,” which also serves as the album’s curtain call. That community also includes Ruination Record Co., the scrappy label that’s putting out the record, and whose co-founder, musician Dan Knishkowy (aka Adeline Hotel), plays guitar on several tracks here. If Office Culture’s breakout album, A Life of Crime, was preoccupied with the lonely indignities of life in the big city, this one is enriched by its eventual rewards: building a community of artists and weirdos, a network of over-talented and under-employed peers who can help bring your creative dreams to life.",0,"October 22, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/office-culture-enough/
Laila!,Gap Year!,7.2,Pop/R&B / Rap,"Trying to convince a teen in the throes of passion that their feelings are not the summit of human emotion is a fool’s errand. On Gap Year!, the debut full-length from Laila!, young love blossoms and withers with crushing intensity. The New York vocalist and producer plants you directly into the whirlwind that is life before 18, muddling through mixed signals and dreaming of being asked to prom. All the while, her melodies sound as though they issue from bedrooms plastered in Brandy and Lauryn Hill posters, a compressed mixture of sincerity and wit. As the album title hints, Laila!—born Laila Smith, the daughter of rapper Yasiin Bey—is a dedicated student of the game. The self-described Brandy disciple graduated from high school a year early and began forging her path as a musician with nimble GarageBand flips of old Brandy and Aaliyah cuts. Her magnetic, carefree persona carried early singles “Like That!” and “Not My Problem,” which Cash Cobain subsequently flipped into a viral posse cut. The almost entirely self-produced Gap Year! is Laila!’s coming-out party, her own version of a throwback self-titled debut. The record plays out as casually as an after-school hang, full of titles and themes that might’ve been rattling around since the morning bell. On lo-fi acoustic opener “Talent Show,” the tactile sounds of amps being plugged in and mics being adjusted seem to play over a scratchy cafeteria PA. Powered by a punchy bassline that wouldn’t be out of place on an early 2000s 702 album, “If U Don’t Know by Now” quivers in anticipation of being noticed by a crush (until then, she’ll leave a note in their locker). The restrained production allows her voice to shine, capitalizing on a sense of familiarity without feeling like a cynical retread. On “Want 2,” Laila! lilts over a stripped-back, bouncy drum beat that spiritually belongs on the back half of the Like Mike soundtrack. Her croons carry an emotional conviction that makes you believe that she means every word. “Were we in love? That’s really what I wanna know/Tell me, what is it gonna take for you to let your feelings show?” she sings on “R U Down?” letting her voice carry as she puts the screws to a particularly frustrating guy. Gap Year! peaks when Laila! centers her vocal performance, acting as a conduit for waves of high-school feelings. In weaker passages, its 17 tracks start to blend together; the repeated musings on love and relationships, especially from an 18-year-old’s perspective, can feel predictable. But there’s plenty of artistic personality to be found here, like the joyful pocket Laila! catches as she spits on “Sani (Homework Freestyle)” and “Not My Problem,” or the falsetto that pierces through the opening bars of “Could Be.” The subject matter may come with an expiration date, but Laila!’s endless stream of heartfelt declarations are worthy of the yearbook pages: “All the love in the world/Is there for you to find,” she sings on the bridge of “Sink 2 Rise.” Maybe youthful idealism isn’t so foolish at all.",0,"September 20, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/laila-gap-year/
Eiko Ishibashi,Evil Does Not Exist,7.5,Pop/R&B,"Eiko Ishibashi and director Ryusuke Hamaguchi both revel in the unresolved. Ishibashi’s music has flitted between toy-box art punk, wide-open free jazz, zig-zagging classical piano, and dreamy industrialism, arriving now at a tense, quietly graceful form of musique concréte in which it’s never obvious what’s coming next. Hamaguchi, meanwhile, has steadily built a body of work delving into the quotidian unknown; the most mundane moments in his films hide the possibility for strange twists, vulnerable revelations, and open-hearted catharsis. Ishibashi’s soundtrack for Hamaguchi’s acclaimed 2021 film Drive My Car not only offered a sweet, sighing counterbalance to the film’s winding search for closure, but also delivered some of Ishibashi’s downright prettiest music yet. It was so successful that the two have teamed up once again, this time for a project of a very different nature. Ishibashi wrote the Drive My Car score based on visuals sent to her by Hamaguchi, along with reference points (a theme song in the vein of Henry Mancini; music that sounds “like a landscape,” she told Variety). But Evil Does Not Exist took shape more holistically. The project began when Ishibashi asked Hamaguchi for imagery to accompany a new live performance she was working on, to be titled Gift. After a visit to her studio a few hours outside Tokyo—where, amid the tranquil surroundings, the two discussed the relationship between cities and nature—Hamaguchi began writing a story about a small rural community that becomes disturbed when a glamping company moves in and threatens to contaminate their water supply. Hamaguchi ended up shooting an entire film around the narrative, and in turn, Ishibashi fleshed out her music to match it. Evil Does Not Exist isn’t a plot-heavy film; as the glamping resort plans how to set up shop in the village, Ishibashi’s music—the secret heart of the story—navigates the uneasy balance between the peacefully snow-covered countryside and the awkward cityfolk trying to interject themselves into its ecosystem. On “Hana V.2,” murky electronic tones bubble like pockets of air in pitch-black tar. Every time the track seems to settle, something interrupts, like lush washes of strings or a sharp piercing tone that returns again and again. “[Ishibashi] doesn't allow you to feel safe while you're listening to her music,” Hamaguchi recently told the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, describing how the composer’s music “seems to continuously develop without ever becoming conclusive.” This constant feeling of being on edge suits Hamaguchi’s own muted, close-to-the-chest rhythms. Ishibashi deploys a number of subtle sounds to achieve this unsettling effect. On “Fether,” dissonant piano notes float over a shimmering metallic tone that refracts about itself like a spinning quarter. “Smoke” swells to a queasy din with moaning brass and pitter-pattering drums courtesy of regular collaborator Tatsuhisa Yamamoto, while the morbid “Deer Blood” follows a circular string melody that slowly tumbles into a dazed loop of mourning woodwinds. Ishibashi’s acoustic sounds convey this sense of the natural world pleading for its life: The title theme, which appears twice, opens the film on a long tracking shot gazing up at the sky through the trees, their skinny branches both powerful and fragile. Ishibashi, with the help of partner Jim O’Rourke on guitar, evokes the woods’ sorrow with a string theme that dips in and out between uncertainty and weeping beauty. In Hamaguchi films, music often plays a critical, yet subservient role: When musical themes do emerge, they serve as emotional rudders to steer the long periods of silence that sit between. On screen, Evil Does Not Exist routinely cuts off the music mid-track. On record, though, Ishibashi’s disembodied chamber music is allowed to fully breathe, following her themes as far as the path will allow, even if they never quite reach clear conclusions. The cloudier nature of Ishibashi’s score leaves it feeling less like a standalone piece than the soft, jazzy pop of her Drive My Car soundtrack. But as a mirror to Hamaguchi’s tale of creeping environmental anxiety, Ishibashi’s ghostly music makes a rich companion. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

King Hannah,Big Swimmer,6.9,Rock,"If you think of other artists while listening to Big Swimmer, that’s not lost on King Hannah. Singer Hannah Merrick namedrops Bill Callahan, titles a song after John Prine, and recruits Sharon Van Etten on two songs; the album, Merrick’s second, is clearly the product of those influences. It’s easy to hear echoes of Callahan’s dry humor and Van Etten’s plaintive vocals; Cassandra Jenkins’ meditative jams and Courtney Barnett’s stoned observations come to mind as well. It’s all in service of Merrick’s meandering writing style, which finds meaning in small vignettes borne from traveling America. At its best, Swimmer feels like sitting shotgun with the duo of Merrick and guitarist Craig Whittle, like a tour vlog set to music. Because it’s so laid-back, Swimmer doesn’t necessarily try to transcend its inspirations, but it’s charming in its own right. Merrick spends much of the album going on tangents in a low deadpan voice, as though recording exhausted voice memos documenting a given day’s journey. A lot of those tangents are genuinely funny, like the job interview that opens “New York, Let’s Do Nothing:” “He said, ‘So tell me something about you’/I said, ‘Well I’m a singer, musician too’/He said, ‘Oh no, not another one.’” Elsewhere, the commentary gets lost amid wandering musings on vending machines, as on the eight-minute “Somewhere Near El Paso.” In the album’s most compelling moments, the observations lead somewhere: Merrick increasingly ruminates while watching true-crime documentaries on “Suddenly, Your Hand,” despairing at the callousness of serial killers without being able to pull away. Merrick apologizes for her obsession right at the end (“And I’ve said it before and I will say it again/I’m really sorry for all the moods that I get in”), but Whittle’s closing guitar solo carries on long after, prolonging the fixation. Whenever the album breaks out of its stream-of-consciousness flow, it shows a clearer sense of identity. Merrick’s secret weapon is her soaring singing voice, effectively contrasting the Sprechgesang of much of the record. On the title track, Merrick plays with her vocal phrasing, speeding up and slowing down like a human tape machine, which makes it more striking when she draws out the line, “If it feels right to do so,” on the refrain. On “Lily Pad” and “Davy Says,” Whittle turns his guitars up: The former is an intentional Slint homage (complete with a reference to the Spiderland album cover) and the latter a straight-up catchy pop song. The tighter song structures are a welcome salve against the duo’s tendency to meander. “Lily Pad” changes course halfway through, and that shift hits harder for its abruptness. The levity of Merrick’s lyrics occasionally goes overboard. In between the terrifically tense guitar breaks on ""Milk Boy (I Love You),” she watches as a parent threatens his child, and the descriptions are haunting until a baffling lyric about Dallas Buyers Club nearly sinks the whole song: “They reminded me of McConaughey/In that film about AIDS that didn’t win enough.” (For the record, it won three Oscars from six nominations, one of which went to Jared Leto.) The sweetest song on the record, and one of the best, is the much lower-stakes closer: “John Prine on the Radio” is literally about chilling out to your favorite music, but it has the most focused songwriting on the whole record. When Merrick harmonizes with herself, it’s plainly beautiful, with no snark deflating the earnestness. On an album insistent on speak-singing across America, documenting every place visited and song listened to, the moments of sincerity are the most distinctive.

Sisso,Singeli Ya Maajabu,7.4,Electronic,"Tanzanian producer Sisso’s eponymous Dar es Salaam studio represents the cutting edge of the singeli genre. Singeli is hardly underground in Tanzania, but its relentless speeds of over 200 BPM provide ample room for experimentation, and thanks to the efforts of Uganda’s Nyege Nyege label—started by two European expats to chronicle East Africa’s fertile electronic underground—its more extreme exponents have picked up more steam abroad than relatively pop-friendly artists like Msaga Sumu. Records like Bamba Pana’s Poaa, DJ Travella’s Mr. Mixondo or Sisso’s own Mateso showcased the Terminator-tough side of the genre, but Singeli Ya Maajabu, Sisso’s new collaboration with keyboardist Maiko, sounds more like an informal, extremely weird jam session. Drum-machine loops gallop forward with the momentum of a cursorial prey animal, while gobstopping sounds sketch out simple musical motifs. “Kivinje” opens with a blitz of sirens and horn-honk synths, and it might take a few listens to notice that they’re playing a classic set of chord changes, I-IV-V-IV, the same as rock classics like “Louie Louie” and “Wild Thing.” Later, the duo eschews “musical” cues entirely, enriching the landscape with aqueous effects (“Mizuka”) and bubble noises (“Kazi Ipo”). Maiko’s synth leads ascend to an almost neoclassical beauty, finding new and simple ways to trace familiar chord progressions. While regional club scenes like singeli are often praised abroad for their supposedly sui generis futurism, Sisso and Maiko draw from a wide palette, maintaining a running conversation with other experimental club scenes. The influence of juke is unmistakable on “Kiboko”; “Mizuka” is a desolate expanse of glass-shard sounds and horror-movie creaks not far removed from Marie Davidson’s “The Tunnel”; and the minute-long “Mangwale” pastes together fluttering choir samples into the album’s only ambient respite. Yet these distinctions tend to vanish beneath the sheer onslaught of the music. Even at a hair shy of 40 minutes, this is a maelstrom of an album, and in an environment devoid of opportunities to go as decisively buck as your typical singeli crowd, listening to Singeli Ya Maajabu might feel like hiking up a mountain through a hailstorm, or maybe playing an N64 game based on Gorguts’ Obscura. There’s nothing like the almost Charlemagne Palestine-like relentlessness of Bamba Pana’s “Biti Three,” but Singeli Ya Maajabu still requires a high tolerance for treble and abrasion. This is true of much of the most cutting-edge pop music in the last few years, from the blown-out rage-rap on Opium to the mind-boggling breakdowns of Brazilian funk to the chipmunk fantasias of hyperpop. Maybe “annoying” is one of the last frontiers the modern-day listener has to cross to find the world’s most vital music, but then, rock’n’roll sounded like noise to Frank Sinatra. Your parents probably aren’t going to enjoy Singeli Ya Maajabu, but once it teaches you how to listen to it, it twists the brain like nothing else.",0,"May 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sisso-maiko-singeli-ya-maajabu/
Allegra Krieger,Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine,7.5,Folk/Country,"New York singer-songwriter Allegra Krieger isn’t speaking in hypotheticals when she tethers two questions together in “One or the Other”: “What do you know about living? What do you know about dying?” Late at night last summer, while Krieger was fast asleep on the fifth floor of her Chinatown apartment, several lithium batteries combusted in the e-bike shop down below. She awoke to banging on her door and, through a disorienting haze of gray smoke, couldn’t unlock the fire escape. So she held her breath, sprinted down the main stairwell instead, and, as the flames spread upwards, slipped and fell. By the grace of a God she only partially believes in, a fireman spotted her and carried her outside; Krieger made it out alive. Her second floor neighbor, Nancy, did not. The bulk of Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine, Krieger’s fifth album, was finished before the building fire, but the stark perspective offered by her escape and the experience of being rehomed in a new neighborhood accelerated its final songwriting sessions. Looming over its 13 tracks of airy folk-rock are questions of impermanence, purpose, and gratitude. Though survivor’s guilt hangs heavy on “One or the Other,” Krieger walks away from the trauma with renewed respect for life. From the sunny harmonies of “Roosevelt Ave” to the love-soaked glee radiating from “I’m So Happy I Cannot Face Tomorrow,” the 28-year-old musician strolls around the city with wonderment in her songs; her ability to make that feeling contagious while still acknowledging life’s pitfalls is a reflection of her musical prowess. Her new album comes barely a year after her last, 2023’s I Keep My Feet on the Fragile Plane, and Krieger’s ability to beautifully retell—but not romanticize—her struggles so soon after they happen is partially a result of her waning faith. After finding purpose in the Catholicism on which she was raised, Krieger discovered a similarly rewarding community in the music world and began to drift from her religion. Like gripping a rosary in her palm during prayer, Krieger’s songwriting on Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine uses physicality to expel pain through repetition and confession: the spindly guitar that prods rhythmically in “Into Eternity,” creaks of solemn piano during the album’s wordless interlude, a fuzz pedal dampening the guitar runs in “How Do You Sleep” as she sings of shame. The louder her blend of folk and indie rock gets, the darker its overall effect becomes. Enrolling in odd jobs around the country as a young adult—farming in North Carolina, staffing a roadside motel in California, planting trees in Georgia—taught her to appreciate time off spent reading. A disciple of Anne Carson and Clarice Lispector, Krieger sings with the poetic cadence and mysterious edge of those she admires. She wrestles with detachment in “Never Arriving,” keeping specifics just at bay enough for the song to be about sex, or technology, or desensitization. Even when she breaks into a Wednesday-worthy scream during the lusty “Came,” she pins up her lyrics with elegant descriptions of midnight humidity and gas station alcohol. More recently, Krieger’s been working as a gregarious bartender in New York, and it’s from this experience—the direct pipeline to a rotating cast of characters and their late-night divulgences—that she extracted the compassionate revelations about human nature that populate her songs. People want connection, security, and comfort within their own bodies. Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine toasts the small things—smiling cashiers, ocean spray hitting legs—that aid our quest to achieve those, while denoting the universal roadblocks, too. “Remind me again,” she sings on “Burning Wings” like she’s wiping a pint glass dry. “What are you doing here anyways?” The poetic urgency and freeform looseness that define Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine dovetail with introspection. When patterns emerge in Krieger’s observations, she sounds like an unsuspecting soothsayer. “If you don’t like the way that it’s going/Then maybe just sit back and wait/For the sky to come crashing over in the blink of an eye,” she advises in “Where You Want to Go,” a rustic, fingerpicked song in the vein of Nick Drake. As if to prove that point, the song ends with a bonafide guitar solo. Krieger knows life can be upended in a second. Five albums in, she’s figured out how to come to terms with that.

The Decemberists,"As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again",7.2,Rock,"Once a figure of ridicule and derision, the nerd defined the first decades of the 21st century even more than the hipster or the bro. This seemed like a promising development, before it soured into misogynistic gaming culture and The Big Bang Theory. The Decemberists, named after an obscure Russian revolution (which they winkingly misspelled), represented a more benevolent side of geekdom: They were smart, of course, but also very passionate about arcana. They fussed over prog-folk epics, sea shanties, and Shirley Collins the way other nerds nitpicked D&D campaigns or Star Wars canon. We knew the terrain of frontman Colin Meloy’s inner emotional life not through confessional lyrics but through his obsessions. The Decemberists weren’t rock nerds, though, which may be why actual rock nerds dismissed them in their heyday. Instead, they were theater nerds—a wildly intense phylum of geek. Meloy wrote songs like playlets, constantly implying a proscenium, and the band performed them like a troupe of thespians, occasionally even reenacting Tolkien battles onstage. There was an element of playacting in every song, which made them seem like the nerdiest band around (even Barenaked Ladies’ theme songs never went that deep). That dramaturgical proclivity festooned quote marks around certain songs (“The Mariner’s Revenge Song”) and even entire albums (The Hazards of Love), but their music always seemed to spring from a benign fixation with the historic and the folkloric. With their ninth studio album, the Decemberists have done something that few 21st-century nerds even consider: They’ve matured in their relationship with their obsessions. They’ve grown up. Not a lot, but enough. The archaic syntax of the title As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again suggests a “return to form” or at the very least a career retrospective. But the album is nothing quite so lofty: The Decemberists are dressing up in yesteryear’s costumery—the character-driven songs of Picaresque, the jangle rock of The King Is Dead, the shaky political engagement of I’ll Be Your Girl—but there are no quote marks around these songs. It’s more a personal reckoning with their own past: a rummage sale of dusty enthusiasms. So there’s an unexpected melancholy to these new story-songs, a poignancy that wouldn’t have been possible 15 or 20 years ago. Meloy understands we obsess differently in our dotage, with a new sense of impermanence and a more acute understanding of mortality. He has sung about death many times before, but it sounds a little more immediate on opener “Burial Ground.” There’s an easy charm in Meloy’s gashlycrumb wit and in the band’s ability to combine various influences so that the familiar—’60s folk melodies and pop arrangements—sounds slightly unplaceable. Is it more Beach Boys outtake or more pre-Days of Future Passed Moody Blues? “Burial Ground” operates not unlike Fairport Convention’s “Come All Ye”: It’s an invocation, an invitation to the graveyard, and the Decemberists know we’re all headed in that direction anyway. That’s how they start the album, and every song that follows—from the “Hell”-acious “Oh No!” to the bittersweet love song “All I Want Is You”—ponders the inevitable end of every story. The long white veil in “Long White Veil” hides not a bride’s face but a corpse’s frozen countenance (gesturing toward the Lefty Frizzell hit “The Long Black Veil”), and “Don’t Go to the Woods” is nothing but dread and caution: a preamble to “The Black Maria,” the dark heart of this album. That title might refer to arcane slang for a paddy wagon, or it might be the Beasts Pirates in One Piece, but Meloy is writing his own canon here. Death is a walking shadow, never glimpsed by the living but known by its heavy footfalls in the hallway. “Turn out your lantern light, set your affairs to right,” Meloy sings over a strummed acoustic guitar and a lone funereal horn. “The Black Maria comes for us all.” As fanciful as these songs can be, the Decemberists can’t help but ground them in the very real, very horrifying present. That’s never been their strongest subject, but they at least try to meet our current moment with the capitalist allegory of “The Reapers” and even “William Fitzwilliam” (which is haunted by the ghost of John Prine’s “Paradise”). The angriest song here, “America Made Me,” might be twice as powerful if it was half as clever, but there is something to be said for soundtracking dissent with jaunty piano and party horns. It’s a tack they’ve been deploying since “16 Military Wives,” although here the sentiment is more potent in its outrage and disgust. As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again ends as you might expect: with a nearly 20-minute epic called “Joan in the Garden.” Its winding length and multi-part structure gesture toward The Tain and its spawn The Hazards of Love, but it might align more closely with “I Was Meant for the Stage,” their creative exegesis from Her Majesty. It’s a song about what the Decemberists do and why they do it, a meditation on art as a weapon against death—but, in this case, not their own. Joan is literally in the garden, deep in the soil, but Meloy can resurrect her with words: “Make her 10 miles tall, make her arms cleave mountains… write a line, erase a line.” After a five-minute folk passage and a five-minute prog section, the Decemberists give over nearly 10 minutes more to ambient noises, stray rhythms, plunked strings, errant synths. It sounds like they’re striking the set and clearing the stage—a softer kind of death—and it’s weirdly moving. They might have stopped there rather than append a dramatic coda, but they never could resist a big finish. As it ever was.

Eris Drew,Raving Disco Breaks Vol. II,7.7,Electronic,"Good news, boppers—Eris Drew finally released the second edition of Raving Disco Breaks, the pick-up-your-feet, turn-your-whole-day-around DJ mix series she debuted in 2019. The theme of the second edition is Rock the House—not exactly rock as in RAWK, but the verb sense of the word, as in “Keep it rockin’.” Once again the mix is available on SoundCloud and on cassette, though it landed on my desk more like contraband, one gigantic audio file too big for cloud storage to handle. Ah yes, I thought, now that’s the good stuff. Naturally Drew remains enamored of throwback breakbeat house, a sound she associates with her initiation into underground rave culture as a disillusioned ’90s kid looking for deeper meaning in life. As on Vol. 1, the cuts are fast, the selections will put you neck deep in obscure 12""s on Discogs, and the mixing style is more DIY party poster than endless scroll. Drew spins through speed-dealing ’90s rave tracks, old-school hip-hop samples, and an incredible, improbably perfect Led Zeppelin guitar part that lands like a caped hero. There are strobing keyboard stabs, Pong synth bass hits, a voice that insists on “just, like, rock’n’roll.” You ever heard Janis Joplin sing a feature on a dance track? You have now. Drew guarantees every sample here to be at least 20 years old, if not older. She remains jazzed on horns. You can breakdance; you can bunny hop. It is an entirely worthy successor. Drew makes body and emotion music, as captured in the name of the label she shares with partner Octo Octa, T4T LUV NRG. And though she’s not the kind of musician who writes lyrics, her love of wordplay is conspicuous. The Raving Disco Breaks mixes make improbably extensive use of language, chopping it up along with the samples into playful cut-and-paste winks. In Vol. 1, it might have been the announcer voice that seems to welcome you to “Clubhouse Disco” (that’s three genres, makes me laugh every time); here it’s snippets of well-worn rock’n’roll attitude slogans and fresh spins of all kinds of tracks that invoke the concept of “rock” in their titles, dialing up famous telephone headset user Terrence Parker’s “Gonna Rock You All Night” and classic b-boy soundtrack “To a Nation Rockin’.” Drew doesn’t write lyrics but she does write an online newsletter. I’m struck by a passage in a recent edition, on the topic of dancing and drugs, where she describes the miserable local ragers she escaped for the light of the underground warehouse rave. “Most of my peers in high school would find a party at some suburban teenager’s house (unwitting parents out of town) and drink until they were blue in the face,” she wrote. “Everyone either was straight or pretended to be. Rock’n’roll and hip-hop were the only ‘real’ music at these parties. … Social norms and cliques were celebrated and reinforced rather than dismantled.” Contra the spirit of rock’n’roll, clearly, though I recognize the scene Drew describes here (perhaps a slightly younger, more sheltered teen would have turned to reading indie music blogs). The best thing about Rock the House, besides being a hell of a good time, is that those distinctions do not matter anymore, have never mattered, and in fact were fluid all along. Food for thought when you hear that little vocal clip of Joe Strummer rapping on the single most disco Clash song, “The Magnificent Seven,” as extracted and sampled by a deep-cut ’90s club track, as sampled and remixed by Eris Drew. So I hope it’s not too mind-expanding to pitch Rock the House as a mix about aesthetic integration, in line with Drew’s personal spiritual concept of a universal Motherbeat, one I like to imagine as a kind of ever-present psychoacoustic ether but also a like a big stack of records—one really, really, really long waveform extending back through the entire corpus of musical creation from the latest live mix to the first human to beat on stone (what were they up to?). It speaks to her singular vision and personality as a DJ, too, though I don’t get the sense that she cares whether you care that this is the Eris Drew Show: You come to this rave to expand the collective consciousness. Good luck fitting that on Google Drive.",0,"April 25, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eris-drew-raving-disco-breaks-vol-ii/
Paul McCartney,One Hand Clapping,8.4,Rock,"It took 52 years and an eight-hour docuseries to confirm that the recording sessions for the Beatles’ Let It Be weren’t exactly the miserable, band-killing ordeals that the namesake 1970 documentary had made them out to be. But long before Peter Jackson put a feel-good spin on the Beatles’ dying days in Get Back, Paul McCartney had already made it clear he was totally cool with having a documentary crew hovering over his shoulder during his most vulnerable moments of creation—because a mere five years after the Let It Be experience, he eagerly subjected his post-Beatles band Wings to the same cinematic scrutiny. Riding high on the runaway success of 1973’s Band on the Run, McCartney and Wings set up shop in Abbey Road Studios for four days in August 1974 and let filmmaker David Litchfield document their every move as they whipped through a sprawling setlist of recent hits, upcoming singles, B-sides, neglected album cuts, off-the-cuff medleys, instrumental jams, songs that wouldn’t be officially released until the following decade, ’50s rockabilly covers, and even a few Fab Four favorites. The result was a documentary called One Hand Clapping, whose overriding concept wasn’t so much “get back” as “get born”—an opportunity to show skeptics that Wings weren’t merely McCartney’s appendages, but a blossoming group fueled by the same sort of collaborative camaraderie and derring-do that his previous band possessed a decade prior. Alas, like the 1969 project, things didn’t go exactly as planned, and it’s taken five decades for a definitive document of the moment to see the light. From day one, Wings were burdened by a seemingly insurmountable contradiction. “For me, I like working with a gang of people, I like a little team,” McCartney told Litchfield. “I’ve never been a solo performer, so it’s natural for me to find myself a group.” Despite his stated desire to be part of a community, the fact is, no one but John Lennon could hope to be on equal creative footing with Paul McCartney in a band. In former Moody Blues member Denny Laine, McCartney found not so much a new partner as a trusted accomplice who could both fill the harmonic holes left by Lennon’s absence and flex the extra guitar muscle required in the hard-rockin’ ’70s. But even with the core of McCartney, keyboardist wife Linda, and Laine in place, Wings were always a band in flux, with different personnel appearing on each record; the triumphs of Band on the Run ultimately owed more to the trio’s crafty approach to their low-tech setup in EMI’s Lagos studio than to a proper band coming into its own. But the version of Wings that McCartney corralled for the One Hand Clapping sessions exhibited the laser focus and playful spontaneity of a tight-knit rock’n’roll band that seemed to have put in their 10,000 hours in just a few weeks. The preternaturally talented guitarist Jimmy McCulloch would be the closest thing McCartney ever had to a swaggering, Mick Ronson-like guitar phenom at his side, and drummer Geoff Britton consistently hit the sweet spot between Ringo Starr steadiness and Keith Moon power (while effortlessly adjusting his sunglasses without missing a beat). Sadly, this iteration of the band barely outlasted these sessions: Britton left the group six months later, reportedly because the drummer—and judo enthusiast—had the opportunity to work on a karate flick in Japan. With American session drummer Joe English stepping in, Wings continued their skyward trajectory with two more chart-topping albums—1975’s Venus and Mars and 1976’s Wings at the Speed of Sound—and an epic world tour. In the midst of this hot streak, the One Hand Clapping project shifted to the back burner before being shelved outright. Cherry-picked selections from the ’74 sessions eventually surfaced as bonus tracks on the 2010 Band on the Run box set, which also included an official DVD release of Litchfield’s One Hand Clapping film. This new release compiles Wings’ Abbey Road repertoire into a joyful 2xLP document of Paul in peak mullet ’n’ cigarettes form, as he was transitioning Wings from a low-stakes Beatles antidote into a formidable rock institution in their own right. Though it was recorded without an audience, One Hand Clapping unfolds like a proper concert, charging out of the gate with the band rocking at full strength, before calling in an orchestra to launch the symphonic fireworks of “Live and Let Die,” detouring into a mini solo piano set, throwing a few old nuggets to the Beatlemaniacs, and ending on a “Hi, Hi, Hi” note. (A bonus six-song 7"" of acoustic recordings captured in Abbey Road’s backyard serves as the comedown encore.) McCartney has spent his entire onstage career contending with arenas full of shrieking fans, so it’s a real treat to hear him perform without being drowned out by screams. Compared to the bombastic, cavernous sound of the 1976 live set Wings Over America, the recordings on One Hand Clapping are appealingly raw and in-your-face intimate, making the listener feel like the sole ticket-winner to a private Macca soundstage performance. In essence, One Hand Clapping is the photo-negative counterpart to Get Back: Instead of capturing the casual genius of pulling future classics out of thin air, it showcases McCartney’s willingness to rough up and rearrange his songbook. With Linda’s fuzzy keyboards jacked up in the mix, this version of “Jet” makes a case for Wings as the first synth-pop band, while Britton’s hard-charging backbeat injects the song with a punky thrust. And while this performance of the rarity “Soily” is more taut and less manic than the runaway-train version that brings Wings Over America to a fiery finale, it retains its status as McCartney’s toughest rocker this side of “Helter Skelter.” Even when he revisits weighty Beatles ballads like “Let It Be,” he approaches them with the carefree confidence of someone who’s discovered a vacant piano stool in a hotel lobby; after singing a verse of his melancholic magnum opus “The Long and Winding Road,” he clears his throat and barrels into a brief run through the jaunty “Lady Madonna.” Get Back’s greatest virtue was allowing us to see rock’s most omnipotent group as mere mortals, wracked by the same dysfunction and insecurities that afflict any band running low on time and inspiration. But for McCartney, Wings represented its own kind of demystification process: In contrast to the Beatles’ rarefied status and trailblazing track record, Wings responded to the music of their contemporaries. One Hand Clapping serves as a time capsule of a moment when rock was splintering off into infinite subgenres, with McCartney’s effortless melodicism serving as the connective tissue between the glammy strut of “Hi, Hi, Hi,” the country serenade “Sally G,” and a divine reworking of “Bluebird” that transforms the Band on the Run cut from a low-key “Blackbird” sequel into a proto-yacht-rock groover. And while critics weren’t kind to early Wings albums like Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway, representative tracks from that oft-overlooked era—like “C Moon” and “Power Cut”—reflect a longstanding fascination with Jamaican music that abetted reggae’s mainstream entrée. For all the charming moments contained within, you can understand why McCartney opted to scrap One Hand Clapping back in the day: It showcased an already outdated iteration of the group, and its loose, anything-goes spirit must’ve felt at odds with Wings’ growing reputation as an arena-rock powerhouse in the mid ’70s. But its reappearance in 2024 aligns perfectly with the current Macca moment, when younger generations of fans have reclaimed him as the patron saint of oddball indie auteurism. The McCartney we hear on One Hand Clapping isn’t so much the pop perfectionist of classic-rock legend as the merry prankster less concerned with pleasing the masses than amusing himself.

Wolfacejoeyy,Valentino,7.4,Rap,"The emergence of New York City’s sexy drill movement couldn’t have come at a better time for Staten Island native wolfacejoeyy. Though he’d already begun to hash out the particulars of his sound by the time Cash Cobain and Chow Lee dropped their pioneering 2 Slizzy 2 Sexy mixtape in 2022, joeyy was undergoing artistic growing pains. For the past few years, he’d been chopping it up in group chats with the underground’s then-buzziest upstarts, like SoFaygo, Slump6s, and Yung Fazo, exploring the moment’s pastel-streaked, melodic trap sound. Though he had a knack for writing the sticky, falsetto-laden choruses favored by his peers, joeyy’s more ambitious output indicated a desire to break from SoundCloud rap’s superficial and often overstimulating conventions. The best of his early cuts were refreshingly organic, backed by baroque string arrangements and mixed with comparatively subtle vocal processing chains. Those effects allowed joeyy to flex his impressive singing chops, while accenting the youthful idiosyncrasies in his voice. After notching a minor TikTok hit with the Jersey club-inspired “buku,” he joined Cash and Chow in the studio to record “weekend,” a gritty R&B track that foreshadowed the rawer sound of his more recent body of work. Trading prurient bars over disintegrated sub-bass and keyboard arpeggios straight out of a platformer video game’s aquatic level, joeyy was finally in his element: His starry-eyed idealism was the perfect foil for his collaborators’ endearing sleaze. “Weekend” appeared on last summer’s 22Joeyy EP, but seems to have catalyzed the aesthetic of Valentino, his first full-length album. Its beats center on quasi-acoustic timbres that suggest a “live” feel, instead of the synth-driven wizardry that has defined the recent wave of DIY pop rap. Jazzy piano chords creak and echo. Backing vocalists weave rich harmonies on “don’t be dishonest.” Fingerpicked guitars underscore interludes. This pursuit of intimacy also extends to joeyy’s pen. Wistfully recalling hookups in triplet flows and licentious detail, he tends to offer songcraft that is more story-driven and cohesive than the horny punchlines that have defined the subgenre thus far. Opener “stop trippin bout girls u don’t know” follows the trajectory of a short-lived situationship—from initial flirtation to the inevitable fallout that occurs when joeyy can’t commit. The track leaves out kicks and 808 pulses almost entirely, paring the production down to chirping hats, droning bass, and elegant synth brass layers. The roominess allows joeyy to experiment more easily: He makes short leaps into higher octaves and imbues the exchange between him and his love interest with voice-cracking intensity. The music may be dreamy ear candy, but the depth and structure of joeyy’s craft puts him a rung above his peers. On “solar,” he takes Valentino’s strangest beat—springy, bitcrushed bass drums and wacky samples that conjure images of a footrace between Looney Tunes characters—and flips the screwball vibe on its head, inviting listeners to follow him as he tries to numb fresh heartbreak in the middle of a rowdy function. As he’s contemplating the strangely dissociative effects of his weed, joeyy disappears from the track entirely, letting the instrumental ride out for a full minute. It’s an unconventional decision, but it works well within Valentino’s loose narrative, which transitions from an initial stretch of gloomy songs to its ecstatic middle portion. A lesser artist dipping out on the track like this might read as a case of poor editing, but joeyy is charismatic and detail-oriented enough to land the stunt. Halfway through Valentino, joeyy plays to his greatest strengths, ping-ponging between blown-out Jersey club stomps and impressionist keys. On “cake,” he’s head over heels as he volleys pickup lines with his crush—so in the zone, he’s practically panting between bars like a tennis pro. Lines like, “I told her she sexy, she said ‘period purr,’” and “My pockets blue like Sonic and her pussy pink like Amy” might seem like a tough sell, but they’re delivered with such sincerity that you’ll want them custom-printed on candy hearts. “don’t be dishonest” features gorgeous multi-part backing harmonies performed by London R&B songwriter Moses Ideka, lending joeyy’s delivery a religious fervor as he offers healing to a potential partner. Only “double tap,” a quirky club tune that resembles the synth-funk inspired bounce of Ice Spice’s “Think U the Shit (Fart)” or Lunchbox’s New Jazz mixtape slows the momentum, its busy topline forcing joeyy to rein in his melodic impulses. Now that he’s finally old enough to frequent the clubs he makes music for, wolfacejoeyy has migrated from the realm of bedroom producers and Discord servers into the real world. He’s benefiting from more developed song structures and writing his most mature, evocative songs yet. His hooks are still unshakeable, but the tiny details and ingenious melodic flourishes that surround them make each listen feel like a small adventure. Valentino hits like downing a flat white when you really should be sleeping: It’s a jolt of restless euphoria that’ll have you ready to leave the house at all costs, wandering in search of anyone’s company—or anything to do.",0,"May 21, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wolfacejoeyy-valentino/
Eminem,The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce),4.8,Rap,"Eminem used to be reckless and thrilling. In the early days, he was a cruise missile slicing through the sky with the names of his targets spray-painted on the side. He aired grievances with a bullhorn, scaffolding crude insults with dynamic turns of phrase and flashy internal rhymes. Eminem could be arrestingly clever, sometimes issuing a line as meticulously written as it was shocking, but you’d never accuse him of being subtle. That was 22 years ago. A generation removed from The Eminem Show, his last great album, Eminem is a shadow of his former self. His lithe and menacing flow now feels antiseptic and strained. The high-pitched, manic tenor of his voice gave way to an ever-ratcheting growl; any East Coast groove or nervy West Coast slink in his beats was replaced by chintzy Casiotone melodrama. He became blocky and unwieldy, careening through tracks with the grace of a Cybertruck crashing into a ditch. His anger and defensiveness never dissipated, though. By the time he dropped his second album, The Marshall Mathers LP, his early screeds yearning for a colorblind hip-hop meritocracy had already lost their impact—by that point, Eminem was an unavoidable cultural force. Those diatribes sound even whinier now. He remains one of the biggest-selling and most-streamed artists in the United States, but Em’s perpetually on a back foot, like a wealthy barbarian at the gates working as hard as he can to convince his critics he’s worthy of praise. His music still clearly strikes a chord for a sizable audience, but he seems to look past them, more concerned with convincing someone—anyone—that he’s the deadliest to touch a mic. Seldom does a blockbuster album sequel recapture that initial magic; The Marshall Mathers LP 2 often felt like trying to draw the original from memory with expensive crayons. Em honed his technical skills so sharply—the lightning-speed flow on “Rap God,” the precision syllable-matching on “Legacy”—that it rendered everything sterile. Notably, he tried to distance himself from his Slim Shady character, using several songs (including the smash hit “The Monster” with Rihanna) to destroy—or at least explain away—his trollish persona. Ten years and three middling records later, he’s back to kill off his alter ego for good. The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) is his attempt at Jungian shadow work, opening the closet for a knock-down drag-out screaming match with the skeletons. It begins with the sound of a hocked loogie. It could be Marshall Mathers trying to rid himself of the taste Slim Shady’s words leave in his mouth. Or it could just be a warning shot: This is gonna be gross. “Renaissance” functions mainly as a list of Eminem’s bona fides, comparing himself to rap legends like Big Daddy Kane and spitting lightly chuckle-worthy double entendres like, “Soon as I quit giving a fuck I started to sell a bit.” Near the end it devolves from a brash pen exercise to an attempt to shield himself from the criticism he can already feel coming. You get the distinct feeling we’ve been here before: “Premonition,” which opened Music to Be Murdered By, covered the same ground. It’s a grim harbinger that we will be exploring no new territory for the next hour. The loose concept behind The Death of Slim Shady, as reinforced through a few skits peppered throughout the tracklist, is that this is the final showdown between Marshall Mathers and Slim Shady. Slim kidnaps Mathers, a nod to his early work, and forces the captive to write the kind of outlandish songs that made him famous. The first half of the album is a dilapidated funhouse, a cheap reconstruction of Slim Shady’s oeuvre. He opens “Trouble” by sneering, “Fuck blind people.” “Brand New Dance,” a leftover from the Encore sessions, is a three-and-half-minute diss track aimed at the late Christopher Reeve, who died in 2004. He mentions Caitlyn Jenner six times before the 30-minute mark. There are confused, angry rants about pronouns and references to South Park. It would all be outlandishly offensive if it weren’t so tired, dated, and developmentally arrested. The album’s centerpoint, “Guilty Conscience 2,” is the ultimate standoff, the two characters meeting eyes and circling each other with hands hovering over their holsters. Em raps with two voices, one slightly affected with distortion to represent Shady, and one with a drier mix for Marshall. The two characters argue like drunken reality show contestants, scrunching their noses and waving a middle finger. Marshall limply explains that Shady’s cruelty is merely a product of his addiction, immediately decimating his own point by needlessly comparing Slim’s embarrassing antics to David Carradine’s accidental death by autoerotic asphyxiation. Slim’s retorts sound like a “debate me” guy invoking the “it’s only a joke” defense. Finally, after exhausting each other’s arguments, the two voices combine. It’s probably supposed to be a moment of absolution, but reads more like an admission of guilt. “I gave you power to use me as an excuse to be evil/You created me to say everything you didn’t have the balls to say,” they both howl. Then, as the album title promises, Marshall gains the upper hand and shoots Slim Shady dead. The day before its release, Eminem tweeted that The Death of Slim Shady is a concept album and should, therefore, be listened to in order. It’s a long slog to get to “Guilty Conscience 2,” but there are moments of genuine inspiration along the way. Though he deflates “Fuel” with an overlong, technique-heavy tirade, Em enlists JID, one of his stylistic descendants, for a breathtaking verse. He shies away from the stadium stomp-clap bombast of his late career, selecting beats that run the gamut from goofy clarinet trap to the crisp, slithering boom-bap that marked some of his best early work. He’s still good for a dumb laugh, even if it’s a bit of a walk: “Call this sex ed with a splash of necrophilia/’Cause when I say that I’m really the evilest, I’m fucking deadass” from the otherwise bloodless “Evil.” But the album flounders, unsure of what it’s trying to say. There are five songs after the ostensible climax, none of which seem like a direction where the real, unburdened Eminem might travel. Maybe The Death of Slim Shady is Eminem’s attempt to indict a bloodthirsty American public, to reflect the zeitgeist of book-banning ideologues and armed protestors showing up to drag storytime. Maybe it’s a treatise on addiction and how substance abuse can amplify the worst parts of yourself, causing untold harm to others. It’s hard to believe any of this in good faith, though. Eminem seems pleased to be wading back into the culture wars: He uses the term “woke BS” and complains he’s being squashed by the PC police. In “Head Honcho,” the first song after he’s “killed” Shady, he admits that “punching down ain’t beneath [him].” His sincerity has the tenor of a bad celebrity apology: “I’m sorry if you were offended, but…” Mostly, The Death of Slim Shady just feels sad. No matter how self-aware he is about becoming the old white guy scared of a changing culture, Eminem can’t seem to get in front of that fact. He was so provocative on his first few albums not because of his lyrics—plenty of horrorcore and gangster rap records were just as gnarly—but because he anticipated the criticism his lyrics would inspire. He set up the hall of mirrors and led you right into it. Despite its dated, unnecessary content, “Brand New Dance” might be the best song here. It comes from the era when he still felt comfortable in his own skin, his gleefully provocative nature and undeniable skill sharing the same space. But now he’s stuck between contradictions; he claims to be above Slim Shady’s acidity but included that song anyway. If Slim Shady’s a mirror, as he asserts in “Guilty Conscience 2,” Marshall Mathers still can’t smash it. All the shards show the same reflection.",0,"July 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eminem-the-death-of-slim-shady-coup-de-grace/
GloRilla,GLORIOUS,7.2,Rap,"Take a blind guess at GloRilla’s favorite Bible verse and you might pick Galatians 6:9 (“And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up”) or perhaps Hebrews 10:36 (“For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised”). Faith, which is not the same as trust, demands that we let go and let God. Or as Big Glo puts it on her new album, GLORIOUS: “Rain down on me Father God, I won’t use an umbrella.” The average American may not have noticed, but for many GloRilla followers, she low-key “fell off” in 2023. Despite the white-hot success of “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” and “Tomorrow 2,” her debut EP Anyways, Life’s Great was tepidly received, and a handful of songs on label compilation Gangsta Art 2 came and went. For the modern hater, a full year between Hot 100 hits might as well be a decade, and so GloRilla’s 2024 has been a recalibration of sorts, including the February single “Yeah Glo!” and tour dates with Megan Thee Stallion. To re-captivate vacillating fans, GLORIOUS finds strength in a higher power. GloRilla’s Christian background is no secret—in interviews, she’s shared childhood dreams of becoming a gospel singer, and she frequently thanks the man upstairs on social media—but it’s hardly come to the fore in her music. GLORIOUS is still by and large a secular rap record, but where Anyways, Life’s Great and April 2024 mixtape Ehhthang Ehhthang were stylistic smorgasbords, her debut album tightens the focus, blending mid-tempo musings on romance and religion with the turnt-up anthems her fans love most. The 25-year-old rapper has grown as a lyricist, but what’s most exciting about GLORIOUS is its idiosyncrasy. Expanding beyond playlistable trap prerequisites and the wistful soul chops that signal A Serious Rap Album, GloRilla channels the music of her youth, cycling through crunk and gospel with aplomb. Before we get to Kirk Franklin, let’s circle back to the crowd-pleasers. Sexyy Red collab “Whatchu Kno About Me” feels like a mixtape loosie, but as fun as it is to hear the pair trade verses over a sample of “Wipe Me Down,” the repurposing of Boosie Badazz’s iconic flow veers toward karaoke. T-Pain swings through on “I Luv Her,” though the contrast between their vocal styles can’t elevate Glo’s pick-me relationship bars (“I know I be naggin’ sometimes/Shit, put dick in my mouth, make me shut up or somethin’”). The back-and-forth hook of “Procedure” lands far better, and Latto goes toe-to-toe with GloRilla’s flex talk: “They call me big mama, bend a bitch over my knees.” As cool as these features are, it’s hard to say GloRilla needs them. Just listen to her stomp through “Let Her Cook,” sneering, “I ain’t gon’ cry in no Honda, I ain’t gon’ cry in no Wraith either,” or the way she swag surfs all over the rowdy and ridiculous “TGIF,” retooling a two-year-old Koto song to show off her “moose knuckle.” An eager student of the Chief Keef school of wordplay, GloRilla brings salty gravitas to tender moments (“The only man that showed me love correctly was my father”) and threats alike (“Talkin’ ’bout you gon’ put your hands on who? Your son gon’ be a bastard”). Being believable isn’t always enough. The pensive Timbaland production on “Stop Playing” fails to gel with Glo’s brash storytelling, undercutting her semi-serious struggle raps (“Ninja turtle, I’m from them gutters” reads dumb but sounds great). The clear low point is the mawkish Muni Long feature “Don’t Deserve,” which half-works until you pay attention to Long’s hook: “Don’t ever let him cheat on you/Don’t ever let him beat on you.” A GloRilla song could convince anyone to drop their ain’t-shit boyfriend, but breaking the cycle of abuse is something else entirely, and it tips the song from sentimental to maudlin. The album’s religious tracks smartly sidestep melodrama and evangelism by focusing on Glo’s own relationship with the divine. On “Glo’s Prayer” she’s desperate over a lover, embarrassed to be “holdin’ up the prayer line about things like this.” Another artist might celebrate how God helped them get over it, but Glo ends the song still ensnared by her feelings, prioritizing messy honesty over neat conclusions. And though “Rain Down on Me” has drawn ire from keyboard warriors aghast that Kirk Franklin would appear on such an explicit album, when GloRilla petitions the Lord, “Watch over my haters, they the ones that make me go the hardest/I just want us all to win, I just want us all to prosper,” well—that’s just Christlike (Matthew 5:44). “Y’all made me feel real crazy,” Glo admits on “Intro.” “So I came back with a vengeance, you feel me?” Even with a chip on her shoulder, her debut album avoids impersonal radio overtures, banking on GloRilla’s taste and charm to remind listeners why they loved her music in the first place. Despite the occasional stumble, GLORIOUS always feels like a personal dispatch from Gloria Hallelujah Woods, taking no shit, never giving up.",0,"October 17, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/glorilla-glorious/
Why Bonnie,Wish on the Bone,7.4,Rock,"Cataclysms social, political, personal, and meteorological abound. It might be something in the water, or maybe every generation feels this crush in a unique way. Regardless, Why Bonnie’s Blair Howerton feels it too. Despite the urge to give up and let impending doom swallow her whole, Howerton and her band spend their new album, Wish on the Bone, relentlessly pushing forward. It’s almost Sisyphean, the way Howerton approaches songwriting. Sometimes it’s just not your day, but as the band posits on “Rhyme or Reason,” “Just tell me when/And I’ll be waiting.” Hope springs eternal. That inclination to optimism—or, at least, a dogged resistance to defeat—reflects in the brilliant compositions that make up Wish on the Bone. The style is always shifting, a restless combination of shoegaze, fried country, straight-ahead indie rock, lilting blues, and more. Howerton and bandmates Chance Williams and Josh Malett made the album with Jonathan Schenke, who co-produced alongside Howerton. Eschewing the Americana-leaning alt-rock of 2022 debut 90 in November, they take a broader look at independent rock’s many faces. Even with the expanded scope, Wish on the Bone is remarkably precise and exacting in its risk-taking. On 90 in November, Howerton wrote about Texas, the place she’d left a few years prior to move to New York. As such, it was filled with tributes to the state’s country roots, unseasonably hot weather, and nostalgia for a time that may not have ever existed. From the outset of Wish on the Bone, things sound different; deeper, more patient, serious. Why Bonnie sound tougher and more confident. Much of this is due to Howerton’s poignant lyricism, which flips from vulnerable to assured on a moment’s notice. On “Wish on the Bone,” thwacking drums and squawking guitars establish a sound somewhere between Songs Ohia and Hop Along. Howerton sings: “Sometimes it’s over before it gets started/So call me when the coast is clear.” It’s a theme she revisits on “Rhyme or Reason,” as if she’s been burnt by overeagerness in the past and now refuses to make the first move for fear of getting hurt. Howerton tends to sound skeptical of those she allows into her world, though Wish on the Bone is at its strongest when she occasionally allows herself to dream, wonder, and yearn. “All the Money” is a tension-filled freight train of a song, shaped by spine-tingling guitar runs and barely-there string atmospherics that lend a feeling of Hitchcockian suspense—a far more interesting tool than surprise. Above the foreboding tones, Howerton wonders: “What if I could/Be somebody’s baby/Never hurting, always loving/Baby?” Spare piano notes suggest such a proposition probably won’t end well. At times Wish on the Bone can be non-specific, and the universality of Howerton’s feelings becomes untethered and slippery. Perhaps that’s why the album ends with the brief, incisive finale “I Took the Shot.” The band leaves it all out there, creating a moment of narrative profundity that suggests Howerton could have a second life as a novelist. Recalling life in Texas over a simple, reverb-laden guitar progression, she revisits her overgrown backyard in Austin and how trying to hate her ex only led to regret instead of vindication. “I’d hope you’d follow me, but behind me there was nothing,” she sings. On Wish on the Bone, Why Bonnie don’t take a second glance; there ain’t a thing back there that’s worth turning around for.",0,"September 5, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/why-bonnie-wish-on-the-bone/
claire rousay,sentiment,7.6,Experimental / Electronic,"Texan experimentalist claire rousay’s foray into melancholic, folk-inflected pop might surprise fans of her tactile collages of everyday sounds like jingling keys, overheard conversation, and suggestive murmur. Those better acquainted with the full extent of her sprawling catalog of self-described “emo ambient”—which spans hyperpop, text-to-speech recordings, and an unfinished Elliott Smith cover—might simply see this as another left turn. In fact, on sentiment, rousay brings together strands from her previous work into a revealing self-portrait, channeling her experimental musical language into the kind of earnest pop she evidently loves but until now has mostly shared as one-offs, swapping her habitually atmospheric ambient pieces for shorter, more melodic, lyrically driven slowcore songs. Where a softer focus and everything perfect is already here were made up of abstract, shifting collages, sentiment has a stable core in her spare guitar playing and yearning vocals, to which she applies heavy Auto-Tune. Despite sentiment’s more conventional singer-songwriter mode, though, rousay doesn’t entirely abandon her avant-garde leanings, using found sounds and field recordings to enrich the album’s texture, depth, and storytelling. The result opens up a new expressive frontier in her work, finding original, affecting ways of exploring despair and desire. Depression figures heavily in sentiment’s lyrics. The album begins with a harrowing confession: “It’s 4 p.m. on a Monday and I cannot stop sobbing.” The line, read by Theodore Cale Schafer, comes from rousay’s phone—an analog twist on the text-to-speech experiments on it was always worth it. sentiment’s frank, conversational lyrics build on a similar nexus of dread and black humor. Heavy drinking (“Blacking out ’til I feel okay” she sings on “it could be anything”) features throughout. Self-loathing proliferates: “I hate me too,” she sings on “lover’s spit plays in the background.” The album is full of sexual longing but links romance to feelings of inadequacy: “Spending half of my whole life giving you head, just in case you need to forgive me one day,” she admits on “head.” Exploring the “infinite void” described in “4pm,” rousay finds a dense tangle of memories, confessions, and emotions. rousay’s concern across sentiment is not so much that these feelings will overwhelm her, but that they might be crushed into numbness—“an even worse reality,” as her note in “4PM” concludes. The album’s steady, lethargic pacing mirrors rousay’s dejection; “asking for it” swells dramatically before quickly petering out, as if it has lost its will. rousay explores anhedonia most affectingly through her voice, using Auto-Tune to give it a robotic quality. Inspired by Young Thug and Sparklehorse, she used the effect on last year’s single “Sigh in My Ear” as well as on Bandcamp uploads like “meg,” “a bullshit creative (dressing room demo)” and “new monkey (unfinished elliott smith cover).” The vocal effect was stark and incongruous in these one-offs, seemingly applied mainly for its striking sound. In sentiment, however, by crushing rousay’s emotive outpourings into a neutral, dehumanized monotone, the effect becomes a powerful conceptual device, exploring the way despair can give way to numbness and exhaustion. rousay’s use of found sounds, previously heard in collages like everything perfect is already here, throw rousay’s feelings of isolation in stark relief as she grapples with the tension between her innermost thoughts and the anonymous bustle of life around her. Her private reflections, run through cold, alienating vocal processing, clash with warm and lively field recordings from public spaces, like the chatter, birdsong, and crunching footsteps in “sycamore skylight.” Disconnected from this outer world, rousay attempts to “convince everyone that I’m ok.” Despite the album’s overwhelmingly interior air, rousay is not alone on sentiment; a number of guest musicians help introduce color, expression, and textural variety. Her guitar playing is simplistic—she learned the instrument for this album—but it’s buoyed by expressive string performances. On “it could be anything,” the crescendoing violin of Mari Maurice (aka more eaze) is glorious, if short-lived, as is the fencing between cellist Emily Wittbrodt and violinist Julia Brüssel on “iii.” But even these guests’ contributions aren’t quite enough to rescue later tracks, especially closer “ily2,”from the album’s restricted pacing and palette. Still, sentiment remains deeply moving, poignant, and original. Channeling avant-garde techniques into melancholic folk-pop produces an album of tremendous psychological and emotional complexity, where the interior world is—even at its most desolate—full of vibrant, complicated life.

Mutant Academy,Keep Holly Alive,7.6,Rap,"There’s a real “if you know, you know” character to Richmond, Virginia’s rap scene. Though it’s a hotbed of hip-hop talent, the city is celebrated primarily for its rich punk and metal history—this town gave us GWAR and Municipal Waste. While it may not be a zeitgeist-defining hub like Atlanta, Memphis, or even Virginia Beach (which spawned Clipse, Timbaland, and the Neptunes), the River City’s impact on the culture isn’t minor. Skillz (fka Mad Skillz), who signed to Rawkus in the late ’90s, spent nearly two decades recapping each closing year with his “Rap Up” song series. Nickelus F was a seven-week freestyle champ on BET’s 106 & Park, briefly wrote for Drake in the late aughts, and has gone on to release several underground classics. One could argue that Black Kray’s Goth Money Records spawned the entire subgenre of emo-rap, and teenage jerk auteur Nettspend’s rising profile feels as inevitable as a tidal wave. You may not know much about Richmond, but you’ve likely felt its influence. For the past decade, Mutant Academy has helped shape the Richmond scene, bringing sustained attention to an often-overlooked city. The collective, founded by Southside natives Henny L.O. and Fly Anakin, began as a way for a couple of middle-school rap nerds to share their love of X-Men comics and Ghostface Killah records. The two met in 2007, amid the “Throw Some D’s” and “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” era, but their own tastes, as they put it to Peter Rosenberg, marked them as “’90s babies raised by the ’80s.” They released their first project, Open House, as a duo in 2014 before expanding Mutant Academy into a Shaolin-sized collective the following year. They’ve been on a hot streak ever since, collecting cosigns from Madlib and Evidence, building an extensive bank of collaborators, and dropping an endless stream of Bandcamp exclusives and LPs. Despite the work ethic, there’s no definitive Mutant Academy record. A few have come close, like Anakin and Big Kahuna Og’s blunted boom-bap opus Holly Water or the trippy loop-digging of Chapel Drive, an Anakin collab with former Academy member Koncept Jack$son. Both albums are largely in-house productions, the credits stacked with fellow Mutants and like-minded Richmonders, but neither presents the Mutant Academy vision as a whole. Now, for its debut album, Keep Holly Alive, the group has settled into a nine-man formation: emcees Anakin, Henny L.O., and Big Kahuna Og, and producers Ohbliv, Graymatter, Foisey, Sycho Sid, Ewonee, and Unlucky Bastards. Named for Holly Block, the Richmond studio that served as their scene’s nerve center, Keep Holly Alive finally puts the crew’s effortless chemistry on full display. The concept is simple: Each producer provides a handful of mushroomy beats, and the three rappers pop up in various combinations to rap like the rent’s due. For such a large and varied group, they’ve landed on a remarkably consistent sound: samples that float as though carried by the wind, crisp drums that crackle and bounce, and the occasional warbling string or synth drone. The six beatmakers tread similar ground but take different tacks; when Graymatter samples soul, like on “Fate on My Side” or “Stay Forever,” he channels classic RZA noir, while Foisey’s “Fatherless Flow” sounds more akin to 2000s-era Hi-Tek. Ohbliv’s “Scheme Sunday” has a similar quiet storm glow as Sycho Sid’s “Paranoia,” but Ohbliv’s sounds are muffled and warped while Sid’s beat shuffles like a neon roller-rink jam. It’s all warm and vaporous, but beneath the humid, heavy-lidded grooves lurks a bit of East Coast grit—Richmond is one of the few Southern cities where you’ll need a bubble coat to get through the winter. The rappers’ styles feel likewise contrasting but complementary. They’re each adept at finding different pockets in a beat without creating unnecessary friction. Big Kahuna Og, a self-proclaimed Dipset acolyte, raps in the halting bursts of phrase that made Juelz Santana so thrilling. Henny L.O. glides gracefully, his sing-songy flow hopping across the drums like a skipping stone. And Anakin is a crisp technician, his nasal yowl, superhuman breath control, and intricate syllable patterns building into a hypnotic latticework. Together, they sound smooth and natural, the result of years spent writing and recording in the same room. Keep Holly Alive isn’t highly conceptual or overly flashy. It sticks to the time-tested formula of “dope beats and dope rhymes,” often forgoing hooks in favor of an uninterrupted three-man weave. The subject matter is tried and true—weed, cars, sex, and rap itself. The producers flex but avoid preening; no one member tries to hog the spotlight. These days the collective’s members are scattered around the country, leaving only a few Mutants in Richmond. But Keep Holly Alive feels reverent, a celebration of their deep bond and a tribute to the city that made them. They filmed the video for “Liberation” at Southside Plaza, a strip mall off Hull Street Road, south Richmond’s main artery; between tracks, Henny’s brother Meech recounts memories of wild times at Holly Block. It’s a joyous album, inviting and endlessly listenable, as much an introductory statement as a love letter—to each other, to Richmond, and to hip-hop.",0,"October 8, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mutant-academy-keep-holly-alive/
Tommy Richman,Coyote,5.8,Pop/R&B,"One morning I woke up and suddenly Tommy Richman went from the white boy Brent Faiyaz took under his wing to a viral pop-R&B sensation. The track that carried him there was an intentionally grainy snippet of “Million Dollar Baby,” which shot to the stars on TikTok. In the clip, uploaded in April, Richman and his crew are in the studio, bumping along to the vibey single as the volume is cranked up so loud that the drums crackle like you’re watching a 360p rip of ’90s Three 6 Mafia footage on YouTube. The song resonated so strongly that one of the two versions of the song uploaded to streaming services was labeled “Million Dollar Baby (VHS),” made to recapture the way his frothy melodies are drowned out by the blown-out bounce. Instantly it was one of the biggest hits of the year, eventually peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. It happened so fast that it drew some outrage, from loudmouthed podcaster Joe Budden who said, “I never wanna hear that Tommy Richman nigga again!” and Hot 97’s Funk Flex who exclaimed, hilariously, “If you’re someone that likes this song, you are a clown!” before playing the track anyway as if he was being held at gunpoint. As someone all for shitting on the overplayed pop song of the moment, Flex and Budden were doing a lot. Actually, “Million Dollar Baby” is pretty cool. It’s about absolutely nothing but that doesn’t matter because of all the songs you’re prone to hear on the radio or at a bar it sounds distinct enough to stand out every time it comes on. Richman takes his label boss Brent’s laid-back falsetto up a notch and mashes that trendy vocal style with a thudding beat that sounds like the early 2010s Memphis-inspired thunderstorms of Bones brightened with some extra synths. And if you squint hard enough, his ghostly croons have a touch of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony to them, but, of course, without the emotional weight. The music Richman was making before “Million Dollar Baby” had some of these qualities, too, as the 24-year-old Woodrbidge, Virginia native, who is said to be named after the drummer of Mötley Crüe, has been tinkering with these airy vocals inside of hit-or-miss genre experiments for years now. The best stuff was either borderline beachy indie rock or Brent gone groovy. There’s a sick feature he has on the 2023 mixtape of Maryland producer Sparkheem—a co-producer of “Million Dollar Baby” popular for his go go-infused DMV crank—that had me wondering if he was born to be one of those R&B hook specialists in an old rap clique, like Doughboy Clay of Doughboyz Cashout or Mo B. Dick of No Limit. But Coyote isn’t as interesting as any of that, choosing to tone down much of the hip-hop influence for safe, inoffensive playlist-R&B. “Million Dollar Baby” is not on Coyote, he wrote, “ART WILL ALWAYS LAST. VIRALITY COMES AND GOES!” The thought seems to be to distance himself from TikTok and to prove to the world that he is more than a one-hit wonder. Reasonable, if the big plan wasn’t to be what the Spotify algorithm recommends to you after listening to Dawn FM or Gemini Rights. Produced mostly by Jonah Roy, with a whole team of co-contributors, the album wants us to really, really know its roots are in ’80s funk and Black pop (he claims to have listened to a bunch of Michael Jackson while making the album) but that music feels skimmed through instead of soaked in. Tracks like, “Whitney,” named after the pop star, and “Vanity” (which may or may not be a reference to the former Prince protégé and Action Jackson co-star) aren’t distractingly bad, but he doesn’t have the soul to pull off the big, ambitious vocal performances. Instead the project is much closer to sounding like the synthier fringes of Toro y Moi and the softer songs off of Tyler, the Creator’s Cherry Bomb. Without a ton of personality, songs in this mid-tempo, chilled-out mold feel straight off the assembly line. Coasting on familiarity, the emptiness of his music becomes a bigger issue. There’s one standout story on “Green Therapy” where he smacks his dad, but otherwise he’s not funny or observant or raw. Cooing “You think I’m oblivious, but damn, I really see everything in everything” on “Temptations” wouldn’t be so dull if the song did more than sound like Silk Sonic’s Motown karaoke but without the endearing dorkiness. Bland lines like, “And I got some time I wanna waste with you” on “Give It All” are supposed to punch through his lilting falsetto but just get swept up in the beat’s generic breeze. The intro, “Elephant in the Room,” a dreamy number about finding the light at the end of the tunnel or whatever, sets the album’s tone: more coffee shop music. What Richman has going for him is his voice, especially when the beats have some oomph and don’t just sound made to be faintly heard in a PacSun. “Tennessee” is a frat rap twerk jam where his smooth talk-sing has the natural swag of throwback Pharrell hooks. “Thought You Were the One” has some zip, too, his wispy melodies settle into a good rhythm as the beat catches an intoxicating thump like you’re walking closer and closer to a block party. If Richman is in the Brent Fayiaz apprenticeship program, he’s still got a ways to go. The R&B star’s greatest music—Fuck the World, his feature on “Swish/Use 2,” the Wasteland singles—is so much more than cool. It’s the kind of music you might mistake as background filler, but then, you get caught up in the mess: Wait, what did he say? Is this guy a dickhead? What’s his problem? Before you know it, his cycle of club nights and failed relationships feel like an entire world that you can’t wait to dig into further. Meanwhile, Coyote is tasteful, feel-good pop hoping to quietly assimilate its way into the machine. That is such a bore.",0,"October 1, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tommy-richman-coyote/
H.R. Giger’s Studiolo,H​.​R. Giger’s Studiolo Vol​.​ 1 & Vol​. ​2,7.6,Electronic / Experimental,"“World-building” is too pat a phrase to describe what Spencer Clark does. Ever since the mulched hypnagogia of his duo the Skaters, with James Ferraro, the California native has been tearing open rifts to the kind of dimensions you usually only read about in pamphlets about lizard people, or find tucked away in the occult section of old VHS stores. Unlike the new-age music Clark’s albums sometimes invoke, his vision of utopia has more to do with Jon Hassell’s extraterrestrial landscapes than with crystals or incense. Like his old bandmate, Clark is entrenched in the psychedelia of plastic pop culture, but where Ferraro spent the ’10s diving deep into the emptiness of smartphone sterility, Clark took a more colorful path. Stitching together childhood memories of dozing off at the San Diego Zoo with half-remembered dreams of ’80s curio kitsch, Clark creates Frankenstein monsters of collagist, tropical synesthesia unlike anything else in noise music. Though Clark has always toiled away more or less in obscurity (almost willfully so, as he adopts and discards aliases at the drop of a hat—Monopoly Child Star Searchers, Fourth World Magazine, Vodka Soap, and Typhonian Highlife only begin to scratch the surface), a handful of his records have stood out. Released in 2014, Pinhead in Fantasia brought an operatic grandiosity to his smeared keyboard hallucinations and became one of his most acclaimed releases. Around the same time as Pinhead in Fantasia, Clark utilized many of that album’s textures and samples in an even more baffling endeavor: a massive, four-disc behemoth titled H.R. Giger’s Studiolo, issued under the Typhonian Highlife moniker. Inspired by a trip to the H.R. Giger Museum shortly following the Swiss artist’s death, Clark left feeling disappointed by what he saw and decided to record his own exhibit of perverse, biomechanical sound objects to match the fantastical monstrosities he pictured in his head. The resulting album represents some of the deepest, most unwieldy music of Clark’s career. Remastered and condensed here into a friendlier 2xLP set, H.R. Giger’s Studiolo Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 offers a more welcoming peek into a freewheeling visionary of the DIY era working at his most far-fetched. Clark’s palette throughout H.R. Giger’s Studiolo is rich with uncanny detail: bongo drums mapped to keyboard samplers in order to play at dizzyingly nimble speeds; pitch-shifted vocals looped and distorted until they sound like the echolalia of an amphibious alien species; dinky harpsichords dancing as if accompanying some loony royal procession. Befitting its industrial theme, however, H.R. Giger’s Studiolo drips with a dank, dungeon-dwelling horror. “Giger’s Bust of Mantegna” moves with the slithery menace of an anaconda, Clark’s clickety percussion drip-dropping all over his ballooning B-movie drones. On “Flesh Ribbons Streaming Water Spiders,” high-pitched wails materialize like imprisoned wraiths crying to be freed from their cages. It’d all seem macabre if it didn’t come across like the soundtrack to the most bugged-out haunted house you’ve ever set foot in. As tracks like “Aquatic Flush of Harpishord Vacui” swell with proggy keyboard solos and opulent timpani rolls, Clark’s mutilated world hums with energy both majestic and hilarious. Clark’s a shredder at heart, never too shy to just let his gurgling rhythms sit back while he goes haywire on the keys. But the true magic is in how he wrangles all those oblique building blocks into place. See how the glimmering synths of “Grotesqueries Metallic Wallpaper” lurch their way into a tense, ribbiting drum pattern. Or how the brief, Theremin-esqe lead that appears halfway through “Giger’s Zodiac Fountains” casts a floating sense of whimsy over the track. Or how the gnome-like grunts of “Giger’s Balinese Green Vaults” slowly build into a chamber of ’80s sci-fi synths that practically radiate chromium light. Clark’s tape-hissy production gives his work the feel of an artifact rescued from oblivion; a similarly hermetic logic governs his loops, which interact like self-contained environments, miniature societies we weren’t meant to see. Clark would go onto make much lighter, sillier albums than this, like the imaginary James Cameron scores of Avatar Blue, or the Darth Maul-inspired incantations of The World of Shells. But rarely has Clark’s music been this aesthetically rich, as cursed and profane as it is dazzling. In all its winding, nightmarish pathways, H.R. Giger’s Studiolo Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 probably doesn’t make for the ideal starting point for newcomers to Clark’s universe (that honor would go to his UFO-obsessed opus The Spectacle of Light Abductions). But accessibility is pretty antithetical to Clark’s outsider project to begin with. Like his best work, H.R. Giger’s Studiolo begs to be pored over like a harebrained conspiracy theory, something to sink into fully rather than listen to in passing. Eighty minutes is an ideal amount of time to spend in this delirium; the deeper one succumbs to Clark’s murky transmissions, the more his mutant language actually starts to make sense.",0,"April 30, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hr-gigers-studiolo-hr-gigers-studiolo-vol-1-and-vol-2/
Fcukers,,6.8,Electronic,"It’s a party and you’re not invited. It’s a room full of girls in little shirts with their sunglasses still on. A karaoke parlor that turns into a nightclub, and for some reason, the Cobrasnake is there. It’s the best $18 you’ve ever spent, you tell your friend, sipping your negroni, while she throws up into a sewer grate. Where would Fcukers be without Dimes Square? In an alternate universe, we’d ask: Does this band sound too much like Saint Etienne? But here we are. Fcukers, which is Benjamin Scharf, Jackson Walker Lewis, and Shanny Wise, are a downtown Manhattan band. They have risen because they are a part of a moment. They have signed to Technicolour, which is an imprint of Ninja Tune. They have been on the cover of NME, where Wise, the vocalist, had this to say about her experience DJing a Celine afterparty: “We wear baggy pants and don’t play rock’n’roll. I wear shark tees, I don’t know much about fashion.” This is the fantasy record companies are selling about New York right now: that if you are a girl with a dream and a 909 kick drum and are friends with that one Clandestino bartender who is also a producer, this too can be your life. Which is funny when you consider the music that Fcukers make. Their debut EP Baggy$$ is of little ambition, which is not a bad thing. It follows a pretty basic formula. A little distorted vocal or three-note melody as the bass rolls, add hi-hats, loop vocals, sweeten it. “Bon Bon,” the lead single, starts off with a snarl. It brings in a drum machine, then a synth sound that’s a little UK garage. Wise’s vocals are like sucking on a Ring Pop so you won’t grind your teeth from taking too much molly. She sounds like the girl from Aqua. She sounds like the girls, plural, from Ladytron. A Fcukers song, at its best, is a really sexy time. It makes you feel cool, however nebulous that term may be. But the scope of this world is limited. Fcukers are not doing anything particularly innovative; they’re not interested in it. A song like “Heart Dub” is not so different from a PinkPantheress track (if a little longer) but with a little more dancehall and dub. Wise performs the dangerous—but not impossible—task of kind of rapping over a Lady Saw–type beat. Looping a drum machine, making the synth sound bottom out like it cannonballed into a Jacuzzi. Having your other references be “Born Slippy” and Dummy, like they are on “I Don’t Wanna.” We’ve been here before, in the “unexpected” crossover between dub and velvety downtempo pop. There’s no risk. There’s no harm in it, either. Perhaps a good contemporary blueprint for Fcukers could be the work of Jessy Lanza, who also makes rough-edged, elegant house music. But Fcukers’ music lacks some of Lanza’s complexity. Their songs are missing a certain gloss, a certain density of atmosphere to elevate them just that extra little bit. “Tommy” sounds like it was recorded inside a trash can and not in a lo-fi way. This is where the fantasy falls apart. But then again, Baggy$$ doesn’t have very lofty goals. It wants you to have fun, kiss your boyfriend on the bus, double dose at the club. To remind you where you are: in New York. And who you are: kind of dumb. Fun, right?",0,"September 6, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fcukers-baggy-ep/
Asake,Lungu Boy,6.6,Pop/R&B,"Asake’s Lungu Boy takes its title from a word meaning “ghetto” or “hood,” but on his third album, the Nigerian artist is at pains to show his worldliness. “I don’t want to be just a guy from Africa, but a guy who came to this world and made a difference in music,” he told Apple Music. It’s a new phase in a rapid ascent. On his 2022 debut, Mr. Money With the Vibe, the artist born Ahmed Ololade synthesized diverse strains of Nigerian pop, then showcased his rise to fame on last year’s Work of Art. Lungu Boy is an ode to the Lagos singer’s humble beginnings, reflecting on his journey and exploring the duality of struggle and success. But by sticking so rigidly to the rags-to-riches script—and his now-familiar balancing act between gratitude and braggadocio—the album acquires a feeling of deja vu. Lungu Boy feels like a victory lap: triumphant but covering well-trodden ground. On Lungu Boy, Asake triples down on his signature palette of Afropiano, hip-hop, and neo-fújì, a style that blends elements of Indigenous Yoruba music (choral harmonies, polyrhythmic drumming, Islamic references) with Afrobeats rhythms and street storytelling. His mid-tempo flow is familiar by now, but he scales back the South African amapiano elements to make room for other sounds. On “Uhh Yeahh,” Dutch DJ Dave Nunes’ production brings a nimble techno touch to the quick-stepping rhythm. On the calypso-inflected “Mood,” over classical guitar licks and the fluttery harmonies of French-Gabonese singer Anaïs Cardot, he reflects on his fluctuating emotions in Spanish. But though it ought to be a natural addition to Asake’s polyglot style, the Spanish verse doesn’t have anything new to say—it’s a direct translation of the earlier English lyrics. There are more features this time around, with mixed results. Stormzy’s presence on the grime-accented “Suru” is a good fit, pushing Asake into more introspective territory as he opens up about his late mother. Other collabs, like the Central Cee-assisted “Wave” and Travis Scott-backed “Active,” aim for peak hype but end up feeling overcrowded. Asake’s charisma and the turbo-charged production are enough for sticky dancefloors, but I can’t help but wonder what might have been had Asake focused less on hitting the geographical coordinates of crossover success. With a nomination for International Artist of the Year at this year’s BRITs alongside titans like Taylor Swift, Burna Boy, and winner SZA, he’s already solidified his global standing. It would’ve been more exciting to see him team up with emerging talent from the African and Black diaspora who could offer more dynamism than the mainstream roster. Consistency is a defining trait of Asake’s sound, so it’s no surprise that he has stuck with his customary producers Magicsticks, Sarz, and P. Priime (though Magicsticks, who produced the bulk of Work of Art, is present on only two tracks here). Brief cameos from Travis Scott collaborator Mike Dean and Sak Pase’s old-school dancehall touch on “Whine” offer moments of novelty, but Asake stays within his established circle. The trusted formula grounds him in his roots but also traps him in his comfort zone. So though Lungu Boy will deliver on Asake fans’ expectations, what’s missing is something more personal. On the emotionally distant serenade “My Heart,” Asake claims to bare his soul to prove he’s capable of love, but lines like, “Ass so fat wan give me ass attack” don’t quite support the case. “I Swear”—a phrase for “I’m dead serious” in various African social circles—could have been an anthem of communal expression, but Asake chooses to sing about material wealth. The most genuine expression of affection comes in “Skating,” a track dedicated to his newfound love of skateboarding. Yet “Fuji Vibe” closes the album on a high note. Singing in a mix of Nigerian Pidgin, Yoruba, and English, Asake chronicles his ascent (once again), this time mixing traditional proverbs with lamba beats. The production, anchored by bass and keys, is rich with jazz horns, building to a hyperkinetic drum solo and soaring African chants. The marriage of modern and talking drums—electronic and analog instrumentation—cements Asake’s reputation as a curator of vibes and a maverick of fújì pop. Listen closely, and you can almost feel the blasts of liquid nitrogen cooling the crowd. It’s an exhilarating rush that nearly compensates for the album’s familiarity.",0,"August 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/asake-lungu-boy/
Rakim,G.O.D.’s Network (Reb7rth),5.9,Rap,"The accepted narrative of Rakim’s solo career—the exacting auteur who couldn’t get out of his own way—makes him an easy scapegoat for his catalog’s shortcomings. Dr. Dre offered the Get Rich or Die Tryin’ beats, but Rakim wasn’t interested; Rakim fled Aftermath with his masters, opting to churn out soggy, unmelodic odes to his own resume. In hindsight, Don’t Sweat the Technique, his final full-length with Queens DJ and producer Eric B., serves as a bookend in more ways than one. The duo dissolved months after its 1992 release, a moment when hip-hop swelled from an underground movement into a global, commercial force. Rakim laid the groundwork, and never quite cashed in. G.O.D.’S NETWORK (REB7RTH) doesn’t upend that version of the story, but it suggests a few complicating factors. Rakim’s spotty solo run (three albums in 32 years, for those keeping score) is blighted by lumbering dirges credited to no-name producers; G.O.D.’S NETWORK countervails the latter pitfall, at least in theory. Rakim produces everything himself, a quixotic endeavor exposing nearsightedness and structural defects—the metronomic drums are too loud for the mix. It might’ve been a torch-passing exercise, but most of the featured guests are 20 years past their primes. Rakim aims for moguldom, but lands closer to mixtape DJ. Rakim shoulders the hooks, but only raps three verses across seven tracks, meaning he’s MIA for large swaths of his own album. Still, the posse cuts are pretty good. “Now Is the Time” signals distinctive taste: The transcontinental lineup of B.G., Hus KingPin, and Compton Menace suggests Rakim and his assembly-line A&R are plugged into regional scenes and attuned to stylistic contrasts. What “Love Is the Message” lacks in novelty, it makes up in the magnetism of its contributors. Fresno veteran Planet Asia’s grizzled plea gives way to a double-time showcase from L.A. rapper Louis King; Rakim exhumes an old Nipsey Hussle verse for good measure. This tape should prompt inquiry into Rakim’s lost decades—he is, after all, an architect of the modern rap album. If he wished to transition into an executive-producer role, mentoring protégés in his image, what stopped him? Somehow, G.O.D.’S NETWORK lays blame at his doorstep. The tempos are plodding and the samples familiar: It’s literate punchline rap for and by middle-aged men, with all that entails. La the Darkman goes full anti-vax on “Pendulum Swing,” seemingly unaware that Fred the Godson, dead of COVID at 35, appears one track prior. “Sign of Se7en” features Sacramento rapper X-Raided, an actual convicted murderer. The curation is prone to hagiography—DMX and Prodigy appear from beyond the grave, along with a voice note from Snoop Dogg that may as well have been purchased via Cameo—without gesturing toward any future. Projects like this, aimed at a built-in audience of true-school crusaders, tend to be received in hushed, appreciative tones: Rakim’s reputation is hardly at stake. What’s curious is that Rakim can’t find anyone to produce or release his music. It’s no secret that hip-hop, as a genre, fails to look after its elders, and the flipside of the equation is that legends have bills to pay. Common just got an album’s worth of vibrant Pete Rock beats; Buckwild and DJ Muggs are Rakim’s age, and more prolific than ever. G.O.D.’S NETWORK positions Rakim as a passable producer instead of an elite MC, but he did it his way.",0,"August 2, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rakim-gods-network-reb7rth/

Mach’s virtual listening event for #RICHAXXHAITIAN, which was designed to welcome listeners into his world, felt shrouded in intentional secrecy: A pair of streams that ran the album once, with no fast-forwarding or rewinding available, no lyrics provided, and buffering and skipping to be expected. The brand of confidentiality he’s built as part of his public persona—marked by a refusal to explain himself, instead letting his knowledge and skill say it all—is akin to a tenured professor who is allergic to slowing down as they blister through lectures. Only if you engage with the material with attention and care will the image of Mach become a little clearer. #RICHAXXHAITIAN is Mach’s first solo venture in nearly three years, since the critically acclaimed Pray for Haiti and Balens Cho (Hot Candles) dropped in 2021. The list of collaborators is packed with familiar faces: Fellow underground darlings, like Sadhugold, Conductor Williams, and Quelle Chris, help out on production duties, while Tha God Fahim, Your Old Droog, and other guests contribute verses. But the close-knit circle doesn’t mean Mach needs to rely on old tricks; instead, he’s thrillingly meticulous, putting his talent for daisy-chaining raps and concepts on full display. #RICHAXXHAITIAN is his most expansive project since 2016’s HBO (Haitian Body Odor); it’s an opus executed with a level of precision that’s come to be expected of the prolific rapper. Mach has cemented himself as a shapeshifter, contorting his voice to rap, sing, and glide over the grainy surface of his beats. And while #RICHAXXHAITIAN is a quintessential Mach-Hommy project—the mixing makes his words garble through the muddiness as if they’re hazy memories, similar to previous records—the production landscape is vast enough to evoke all of his vocal personalities. The percussive crashes and soothing scales from the hands of pianist Georgia Anne Muldrow create the perfect foil for Mach’s morose bars on “Sonje.” His crooning against the accordion on “The Serpent and the Rainbow,” the storybook piano loops of the Quelle Chris-composed “Copy Cold,” and the trudging drums of “Antonomasia” are perfect for headphones on a sub-zero day in Newark in 1997. All register as adventures born out of ease and supreme confidence. His meandering style turns his verses into close reading exercises. Mach’s raps are effective because of his trilateral approach: The man possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of cultural touchstones, an innate sense of timing that catches the listener off-balance, and a gallows humor that is ripe for comical punchlines. Even if some seem unspectacular in a vacuum (“Flip you on the track like Tyshawn Jones,” he spits with delight to open “Padon,” and “blue cheese” bars on “Gorgon Zoe Lan”), the precision and detail with which he strings the references together is one of his strongest artistic gifts. When you recognize the wordplay hidden in the depths of “Antonomasia,” or lose yourself in the parallelism of “Guggenheim Jeune,” you’ll realize that Mach is a master manipulator of structure. Like a virtuoso of martial arts, his flurries of bars are not aimless swings or lucky punches—but pinpoint jabs that land harder with every hit. Across its 17 tracks and 47 minutes, #RICHAXXHAITIAN feels like the closest to a biographical work for Mach-Hommy. That’s not to say the album is rife with sordid details and tell-all tales. His signature caginess and opacity remain; personal histories are contained to topics already known to fans, like his immigration journey from Port-au-Prince to New Jersey. As on previous projects, he’ll launch into Kreyòl without a lick of concern about the potential need for translation. But the choice causes his more forthright statements and vignettes to land with more vigor, especially when he delivers them with a bristling rancor. There are hooks about the International Monetary Fund and interludes about how the scourge of late-stage capitalism is keeping Haiti from achieving revolutionary change. When Mach spits, “White phosphorus fell on civilians in Gaza/Troglodytes squadron yelling epithets in a jogger,” with ferocity on “POLITickle,” it lands with the impact of an expanding bullet. A particular line rings in your ears on “Lon Lon,” as his rambling brushes against the angelic flute of the 1970 Archie Whitewater sample; it’s a proclamation of who Mach is and why he does this: “I’m not your token Nigger boy rapping/I’m a charming-ass composer.” For long stretches of its runtime, #RICHAXXHAITIAN cruises around like a victory lap, for better or for worse. Mach spars with Roc Marciano, Tha God Fahim, and Black Thought, the legendary emcees blistering over sample loops stride-for-stride, as if their chemistry sliders are turned up to the max. The album is not without missteps, like a regrettable Your Old Droog verse on “Empty Spaces” and a Kaytranada-produced single that would have been better as a loosie. But enough peaks overcome the project’s shallow valleys. Take the finale, “Holy ___,” with its lush choral arrangements and decadent orchestral strings, which feel like a biblical exaltation of his journey as an artist and adherence to the values that have allowed him to retain his soul. Mach departs with final pieces of wisdom about the realities of the streets he grew up in, sneaking in a sly qualifier: “Just an observation from a Haitian teaching all the Yanks,” he raps. It arrives with an aimless shrug, as if Mach holds all the truths you may need. He doesn’t care about what direction you believe his sound should go into, or if you’re convinced about the gospel he’s doling out—the moment his voice hits your eardrum, he will command your full attention.",0,"May 23, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mach-hommy-richaxxhaitian/
KOKOKO!,Butu,7.3,Experimental,"The first sound on KOKOKO!’s Butu is the sound of bustling traffic. It takes about a minute for the outline of the opening song, “Butu Ezo Ya,” to emerge from the hubbub, as siren synths and shouts that could be mistaken for those of drivers and angry pedestrians reveal themselves as the sound of the band and their instruments. Maybe it’s second nature for a group formed in Kinshasa, the most populous French-speaking city in the world, but this ostensible party music suggests an almost Untrue-like level of metropolitan density. Stereogum’s Tom Breihan said that Usher’s “Yeah!” sounds like it’s playing in a club, no matter where you encounter it. I thought something similar while listening to Butu: This music could turn anyplace into a teeming street corner. KOKOKO! started out as an unconventional quartet making twitchy techno-punk with objects like typewriters and oil barrels—a workaround for the high cost of gear in Kinshasa. Now the duo of Congolese vocalist Makara Bianko and French producer Débruit, the band brings a polyglot perspective to a long lineage of paranoid electronic rock. Both collaborators come from the dance-music universe, yet Bianko’s sweaty shouts and Débruit’s tarnished production impart an unmistakable whiff of punk; fans of electro-punk upstarts Special Interest and Lip Critic will find plenty to love here. “Butu” is a word for “night” in Lingala, one of several languages used by Bianko on the record. Butu’s aesthetic is often associated with clubs and bars, and producer Débruit—a DJ since the late 2000s—flexes his house muscle here, setting Bianko’s voice against irregular snares and overdriven basslines. Sometimes Bianko sounds like a rapper, as when he slips into an impressive triplet flow on “Telema.” Other times he’s a shirtless hardcore shouter, an arch goth crooner, or a relentless human sample. Cloaked in an evocative swath of reverb, Bianko’s competing layers of shouts and ad-libs create the impression of a small posse rather than a single singer. The illusion of continuous chatter and conversation is compelling enough even if you don’t understand any of the languages spoken therein. The band performed in Devo-like hazmat suits early on, and like Devo, KOKOKO! like catchphrases that double as party chants and political statements: “Donne-Moi” (“Give Me”) can refer either to the give and take between a performer and the audience or the exploitation of the Congo’s musical and natural resources by foreign intervenors. “Move the world,” Bianko entreats listeners on “Mokili.” Maybe he’s talking about dancing, maybe political involvement—either way, the tumult of humanity KOKOKO! conjure on Butu sounds capable of shaking the planet off its axis.

The Pogues,Rum Sodomy & the Lash,9.5,Rock,"When Shane MacGowan died last year, it felt like the passing of a head of state. In a sense it was: The Irish president attended the funeral; a pre-recorded Bono read from St. Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians; Nick Cave sang a moving “Rainy Night in Soho.” And by the time the assembly was laying into an unexpurgated reading of “Fairytale of New York”—a white-bearded Glen Hansard leading the congregation, with neo-trad ambassador Lisa O’Neill singing Kirsty MacColl’s parts, Spider Stacey and other Pogues accompanying them on instruments as MacGowan’s widow and others waltzed near the altar—it’s a fair bet many of those present, not to mention those watching the livestream, were blinking back tears. (I certainly was.) Even the pious outcries that followed this unconventional mass felt perfect—one imagined MacGowan’s jagged grin shining down from heaven. Why such reverence? For one thing, MacGowan and the Pogues made Irish roots music cool. Sure, music nerds admired the native folk revivalists of the 1970s like Planxty and Clannad, the family band that briefly worked with kosmische legend Conny Plank and launched the career of sister Enya before finding their own crossover fame. Some American country artists appreciated the Irish influence on, and dialogue with, their own music. And Bob Dylan covered his share of Irish-rooted tunes; among others, a handsome take on “The Auld Triangle” turned up among the Basement Tapes. As punk bubbled up at CBGB and Max’s in the Irish diaspora of New York City, you could still hear the ’60s folk-revival sounds of Ed Sullivan faves the Clancy Brothers and the Dubliners in countless Irish bars. But these were better known as hangouts for pensioners and off-duty cops than destinations for live music. By the time the Pogues ramped up in the early ’80s, pre-Riverdance and Van Morrison’s LP with the Chieftains, Irish trad was squarely stuff for family gatherings, if it was in your bloodline, trotted out with the green beer and public drunkenness on St. Paddy’s Day. But the Pogues went beyond revivalism. They built a canon of their own, much of it flowing from the golden pen and orthodontically imposing mouth of MacGowan, their frontman and main songwriter. You glimpsed his gift on their debut, Red Roses for Me. Roughly half standards, including “The Auld Triangle,” it also had MacGowan’s “Boys From the County Hell,” a rabid, myth-building anthem loaded with writerly turns: The boys and me are drunk and looking for youWe’ll eat your frigging entrails and we won’t give a damnMe daddy was a blue shirt and my mother a madamMy brother earned his medals at My Lai in Vietnam The boozing, the gang mentality, the black humor, the tangled and brutal history of occupation and emigration embedded in highly compressed storytelling are all there, laid over carousing beats suitable for jigs or pogo-ing. The Pogues were born of the first-wave British punk scene, where MacGowan became an accidental icon before he even had a band, first becoming a poster boy when he was photographed with a bloody ear at a Clash gig, then launching a single issue of a zine called Bondage. That the Pogues were a British band complicated things further. But being accepted in the world of Irish traditional music was beside the point—that music was the blood beneath the scab the Pogues were picking at, animating DNA within battered souls scattered across the culture’s diaspora. In some ways, the Pogues’ “Britishness” was the point. All these factors produced the perfect storm of Rum Sodomy & the Lash. Producing was Elvis Costello, already established as a British punk-pop wunderkind, and who had some Irish blood himself. He’d signed on after inviting the Pogues to open shows on his Goodbye Cruel World tour, an invite issued at least in part because he was smitten with bassist Cait O’Riordan, with whom he’d have a 16-year relationship. To the studio Costello brought a technical knowledge greater than anyone in the band. According to accordion player James Fearnley, writing in his band memoir Here Comes Everybody, Costello kicked in acoustic guitar here (“Dirty Old Town”), mandolin there (“A Pair of Brown Eyes”), and suggested key modulations (“Old Main Drag”). Some session players came in for overdubs, among them uilleann piper Tommy Keane—a credentialed Irish folk musician—and the Tennessee-born fiddler Henry Benagh. Mostly, though, Costello stayed out of the way, intent on capturing the band’s scrappy energy with minimum studio intervention; his oft-quoted hindsight quip was, “I saw my task was to capture them in their dilapidated glory before some more professional producer fucked them up.” Capture them he did. The sound of Rum Sodomy & the Lash is a fever-dream of a pub session, acoustic instruments tumbling forward with piercing attack alongside electric bass, singing, and hollering that indeed seemed to issue from the bowels of County Hell. Like a pub session, there were instrumentals, and various singers brought their individual game. O’Riordan delivers the Scottish traditional “I’m a Man You Don’t Meet Every Day” with canny casualness, like the barmaid who finally agrees, after locking up and downing a few, to sing one herself. Tin whistle player Spider Stacy serves up the American folk song “Jesse James” with gruff hootenanny respect, the sound of TV-Western gunfire in the distance adding comic punctuation. But it’s MacGowan’s show, as “The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn” makes clear straight away, his arresting sneer pushed up so far in the mix you can smell his whiskey breath. Suddenly you’re at a wake, or a near-wake, with a character—some sort of war hero, or just a debauched rogue mercenary—stretched out at death’s door, while wild tableaus swirl around him. You don’t need to recognize the names of the Irish politicians and opera singers, or the references to Celtic mythology, to understand this was a song about life lived to a hallucinatory and hilariously frightening hilt: brawling and getting beat down, drinking and pissing yourself, buying sex and getting syphilis, vomiting in church and, finally, climbing out of your grave to shout, “We’ll have another round!” MacGowan spits his verses full-tilt as the band matches him, with Ramones-style “one-two-three-four”s punctuating each lurch into the fray. MacGowan was well-read—legend has him consuming Dostoyevsky and Joyce as a kid—and was recognized as a remarkable writer before getting kicked out of London’s prestigious Westminster School for dealing drugs. And he admired literary songwriters, among them Lou Reed, who similarly spent time in a mental hospital as a teen (MacGowan nodded to his own experience in the Pogues’ first single, “Dark Streets of London,” and sang three words on the all-star 1997 BBC charity single release of Reed’s “Perfect Day”). MacGowan’s “The Old Main Drag” is an impressive bit of Reed-ian dirty realism: a buoyant semi-autobiographical waltz riding accordion and banjo, conjuring a hardscrabble teenage rent boy in London’s West End, turning tricks in alleys, hustling pills, and being beaten by cops. As a songwriter, MacGowan’s greatest achievements were arguably, like Reed’s, his ballads. “A Pair of Brown Eyes” was his first masterpiece, and might be his most potent song—a nesting egg of stories within stories and songs within songs. The melody recalls “Wild Mountain Thyme,” a love song with Scottish and Irish roots extending hundreds of years, as the singer drowns his sorrows in a pub listening to 20th-century jukebox corn: Johnny Cash’s “A Thing Called Love,” Irish country duo Philomena Begley & Ray Lynam’s emigrant weeper “My Elusive Dreams.” An old man buttonholes the narrator with horrific war stories, attempting to commiserate, but their existential divide yawns, while the eyes of the title haunt them both. When MacGowan presented it to his bandmates, they were startled by its power. Spider Stacy, on hearing the line about limbs “labeled parts one to three,” exclaimed with admiration: “You sick fuck.” Fearnley was brought near tears. MacGowan’s writing shines on the pub-life reverie “Sally MacLennane,” and he enlivens Phil Gaston’s words on “Navigator,” an irony-chiseled workers’ anthem for laborers who “shift a few tons of this earthly delight” and who “died in their hundreds with no sign to mark where.”But in the end, two standards define the album. Ewan MacColl may have written “Dirty Old Town,” and the Dubliners scored the first and biggest hit by chart position. But even if his delivery nods to the Dubliners’ Luke Kelly, the song became MacGowan’s from the moment he croaked the first chorus, transforming it from regional plaint to cosmic blues. The album ends with Eric Bogle’s “And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda,” one of the greatest anti-war songs ever written. There may be more striking versions of the Scottish/Australian folk lament (see June Tabor’s 1976 recording). But MacGowan’s sozzled, stoic, rueful depiction of a legless Australian soldier (“No more waltzing Matilda for me”) in the shadow of modern Britain’s fading empire, ghosted by somber Salvation Army brass, feels vivid and true—an Irish punk’s fittingly romantic, world-weary endnote. With its title taken, in similar spirit, from Winston Churchill’s apocryphal diss of the Royal Navy, and its dada-classical cover image of an iconic French Romantic painting of a shipwreck (with band members’ faces artfully graffitied onto the battered bodies), Rum Sodomy & the Lash launched the Pogues internationally. They burned impossibly bright for a while. There was the brilliant Poguetry in Motion EP, the dazzlingly ambitious If I Should Fall From Grace With God, with “Fairytale of New York.” I saw the band twice in New York City around this time, and the revelry, onstage and off, was awesome and scary; Nirvana’s mosh pits were kindergarten recess by comparison. But the albums got weaker, and by 1991 things had fallen apart. MacGowan was kicked out of the band; his substance abuse issues were certainly a factor. And everyone muddled on. MacGowan remains a songwriter’s songwriter. The late David Berman included Rum Sodomy & the Lash in a list of the 10 albums that would fill his ultimate imaginary bar jukebox. Cat Power covered “A Pair of Brown Eyes” as a prayer, Titus Andronicus as a punk anthem à la early Clash. In the booklet of the 2005 reissue of Rum Sodomy & the Lash, which added the excellent Poguetry in Motion EP and single B-sides, Tom Waits described the band’s music in a poem: Rapscallion, angry, weepingPassed out songs, songsThat seem to be bornEffortlessly, orNot born but foundOn top of an old wood stove He concluded that these were “songs that we all should carry.” Many of us do, in pubs and cars and backyards. One night this summer, boozing in the light of an illegal campfire on a beach in Cape Cod among friends and family with a couple of guitars, our usual instigators led us in song. And as always, the heartiest singing was on “A Pair of Brown Eyes”—a song of boundless ache, written for the ages across the ocean lapping at our feet. Correction: An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that Shane MacGowan wrote “Navigator.” The track was written by Phil Gaston.",0,"September 8, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-pogues-rum-sodomy-and-the-lash/
Taylor Swift,The Tortured Poets Department / The Anthology,6.6,"Pop/R&B Reviewed: April 22, 2024 Taylor Swift’s music was once much bigger than her. A born storyteller, she gathered up the emotional ephemera of her life and molded it into indelible songs about herself, but also about young women—about their sorrow, their desire, their wit and will. She was the girl next door with the platinum pen, her feelings worth hearing about not simply because they existed but because she turned them into art. Those days are gone. Swift, pumped up to mythical proportions by discursive oxygen, is bigger than her body of work—no knock against her body of work. She is her own pantheon: a tragic hero and a vindicated villain; an inadvertent antitrust crusader and a one-woman stimulus package; an alleged climate criminal and fixer; The Person of the Year of the Girl. Over the past 13 months, she’s strapped on her spangled bodysuit and performed a Herculean feat three nights a week on the highest-grossing tour of all time, earning her vaunted billion-dollar valuation. Her musical achievements are remarkable. But nobody makes a billion dollars from music alone. The Tortured Poets Department, Swift’s 11th studio album, senses that widening gap between Taylor Swift the artist and Taylor Swift the phenomenon, and wants to fill it with a firehose of material. The burden of expectation is substantial: This is Swift’s first body of new work since the end of a years-long relationship and a pair of high-profile, whirlwind romances—one of which, with the 1975’s Matty Healy, appears to have provided much of the inspiration here. Fans came to Tortured Poets seeking emotional catharsis, or at least the salacious details. Swift, it seems, wanted the comfort of familiarity. Returning to Jack Antonoff and the National’s Aaron Dessner, her primary songwriting and producing partners of the last several years, Swift picks up threads from Folk-more and Midnights without quite pulling anything loose. Tortured Poets’ extended Anthology edition runs over two hours, and even in the abridged version, its sense of sprawl creeps down to the song level, where Swift’s writing is, at best, playfully unbridled and, at worst, conspicuously wanting for an editor. The winking title track—a joke about its subjects’ self-seriousness—makes fun of the performance of creative labor, which is funny, given the show that Swift is putting on herself. She piles the metaphors on thick, throws stuff at the wall even after something has stuck, picks up the things that didn’t stick and uses them anyway. That’s why we end up in “Florida!!!” for no apparent reason; why the dirge “So Long, London” names five different causes of death; why “My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys” is allowed to work a schoolyard premise until it cracks. But unruliness also produces the wild wonder of “But Daddy I Love Him,” a spiritual descendent of “Love Story” where the protagonists are knocking down castle walls instead of stealing glances in the ballroom. Dessner’s propulsive string arrangement and Swift’s narrative marks keep the song moving even as it stretches towards six minutes, reaching flights of fantasy unlike anything else on this album. Swift is nimble here, heel-turning and cackling through the chorus (“I’m having his baby/No I’m not, but you should see your faces”). Perhaps she’s after a sort of text painting—an effort to reflect the all-consuming, uncontainable nature of her sordid affair in the shape of the music itself. Perhaps she is playing with scale, drawing a contrast between a relationship’s brevity and its broad impact. “Fortnight,” a lethargic, druggy opener with an oozing Post Malone feature, sets up both the timeline and the stakes: “I love you/It’s ruining my life/I touched you for only a fortnight.” From there, Swift assembles, song by song, an exquisite corpse of a love interest, a “tattooed Golden Retriever” who smokes like a chimney and plays with guns and makes her feel like a kid again and could maybe, possibly, father kids of her own. He is alluring and unreliable. He has a terrible reputation. He is the conduit through which Swift returns to many of the themes that have defined her 2020s output: marriage and commitment; the currency of youth; the cruelty of public opinion. There is a clear emphasis here on vulnerability; it’s an effort to rub some of the varnish off of Taylor Swift the commercial product and focus on Taylor Swift the tender, unlucky romantic with whom we fell in love so many years ago. No matter her stature, Swift can still reach the everywoman. She is versed in memespeak: “Down Bad” works because of the juxtaposition between its banal hook and its description of “cosmic love”; the corporate girlies will go feral for “I cry a lot but I am so productive” (“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”). I can even get on board with the outlaw machinations of “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),” if mostly for the lyrical backflip of its chorus: “They shook their heads saying, ‘God help her’ when I told ’em he’s my man/But your good Lord didn’t need to lift a finger/I can fix him, no really I can.” Swift would have us believe that this album represents an unprecedented level of access to her inner life—an exorcism of her true feelings about a relationship whose general outline is widely recognizable. “I’ve never had an album where I needed songwriting more than I needed it on Tortured Poets,” she told an audience in Melbourne ahead of the release. Remember, though, that she has been using songs to litigate her private affairs with public figures since her breakup with Joe Jonas in 2008. What’s changed is not the intimate writing; it’s the appetite for the minutiae of Swift’s life, and the sheer quantity of material she’s feeding it with. Clues and keywords that might once have been left for the liner notes are littered throughout the lyrics. If you know, you know; if you don’t, please choose from any of the hundreds of explainers. It’s not Swift’s fault that we’re so obsessed with her, but this album gives the impression that she can’t quite hear herself over the roar of the crowd. Tearjerkers like “So Long, London” and “loml” fall short when every lyric carries equal weight. There’s no hierarchy of tragic detail; these songs fail to distill an overarching emotional truth, tending to smother rather than sting. It would help if Swift were exploring new musical ideas, but she is largely retreading old territory—unsurprising, perhaps, given that the last three years of her life have been consumed by re-recording her old albums and touring her past selves. The new music is colored in familiar shades of Antonoff (sparse drum programming, twinkly synths) and Dessner (suppler, more strings). Songs sound like other songs—“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” like Midnights’ “Mastermind”; the intro of “So Long, London” like that of Folklore’s “My Tears Ricochet.” Her melodies feel staid, like they are made to fit the music, rather than the other way around. Also familiar are Swift’s tortured ideas about her own public image. The morbidly sexy Antonoff joint “Guilty as Sin?” has her “drowning in the Blue Nile,” borrowing the backbeat of “The Downtown Lights,” and comparing herself to Jesus, crucified for her trysts. On “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?”, the imagery is convoluted: Swift is both a defanged circus animal and a witch who “put narcotics into all of [her] songs.” The Swift of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” is more fun but still creepy—a glittering zombie under stage lights, smiling as she rots away inside. Swift the workhorse, Swift the beacon of capitalism, Swift on a never-ending conveyor belt between the stage and the studio. This is the Swift that brings us The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, maximally bloated with 15 (15!) additional songs. Those that stand out mostly do so for the wrong reasons: There’s the one that borrows its premise from Olivia Rodrigo, but executes it less skillfully; the one where Swift dwells on her resentment toward Kim Kardashian; the one with that weird lyric about racism in the 1830s. This data-dump release strategy is not at all unique to Swift; it’s a concession to the modern music economy, which incentivizes artists to batch as many songs as possible, in as many packages as possible, to juice streams and sales. I look back fondly on the more modest tactics of “Our Song,” the last track on Swift’s debut, where she literally sang “play it again” in the final chorus. If Swift believes that output for its own sake is what she has to offer, she underestimates her gift. Listeners who believe that her every ounce of experience is inherently interesting—because she was the one to have it—misunderstand her as well. Taylor Swift doesn’t need a whole album to tell the story of a relationship; she only needs one song, sometimes even one line. She almost has it in Tortured Poets’ title track, with the tossed-off brilliance of “We’re modern idiots.” She’s nearly there with the vignette, which needs a bit more burnishing, about her man slipping a ring from her middle to her eager left ring finger at dinner. You can see what she’s chasing here: the moment in time that triggers a flash of feeling that lasts forever—the sort of thing people call Swiftian. We’ve been students of Swift’s poetry for years. The lesson of The Tortured Poets Department is not to push through the pain—it’s to take the time to process it. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

He is the conduit through which Swift returns to many of the themes that have defined her 2020s output: marriage and commitment; the currency of youth; the cruelty of public opinion. There is a clear emphasis here on vulnerability; it’s an effort to rub some of the varnish off of Taylor Swift the commercial product and focus on Taylor Swift the tender, unlucky romantic with whom we fell in love so many years ago. No matter her stature, Swift can still reach the everywoman. She is versed in memespeak: “Down Bad” works because of the juxtaposition between its banal hook and its description of “cosmic love”; the corporate girlies will go feral for “I cry a lot but I am so productive” (“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”). I can even get on board with the outlaw machinations of “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),” if mostly for the lyrical backflip of its chorus: “They shook their heads saying, ‘God help her’ when I told ’em he’s my man/But your good Lord didn’t need to lift a finger/I can fix him, no really I can.” Swift would have us believe that this album represents an unprecedented level of access to her inner life—an exorcism of her true feelings about a relationship whose general outline is widely recognizable. “I’ve never had an album where I needed songwriting more than I needed it on Tortured Poets,” she told an audience in Melbourne ahead of the release. Remember, though, that she has been using songs to litigate her private affairs with public figures since her breakup with Joe Jonas in 2008. What’s changed is not the intimate writing; it’s the appetite for the minutiae of Swift’s life, and the sheer quantity of material she’s feeding it with. Clues and keywords that might once have been left for the liner notes are littered throughout the lyrics. If you know, you know; if you don’t, please choose from any of the hundreds of explainers. It’s not Swift’s fault that we’re so obsessed with her, but this album gives the impression that she can’t quite hear herself over the roar of the crowd. Tearjerkers like “So Long, London” and “loml” fall short when every lyric carries equal weight. There’s no hierarchy of tragic detail; these songs fail to distill an overarching emotional truth, tending to smother rather than sting. It would help if Swift were exploring new musical ideas, but she is largely retreading old territory—unsurprising, perhaps, given that the last three years of her life have been consumed by re-recording her old albums and touring her past selves. The new music is colored in familiar shades of Antonoff (sparse drum programming, twinkly synths) and Dessner (suppler, more strings). Songs sound like other songs—“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” like Midnights’ “Mastermind”; the intro of “So Long, London” like that of Folklore’s “My Tears Ricochet.” Her melodies feel staid, like they are made to fit the music, rather than the other way around. Also familiar are Swift’s tortured ideas about her own public image. The morbidly sexy Antonoff joint “Guilty as Sin?” has her “drowning in the Blue Nile,” borrowing the backbeat of “The Downtown Lights,” and comparing herself to Jesus, crucified for her trysts. On “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?”, the imagery is convoluted: Swift is both a defanged circus animal and a witch who “put narcotics into all of [her] songs.” The Swift of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” is more fun but still creepy—a glittering zombie under stage lights, smiling as she rots away inside. Swift the workhorse, Swift the beacon of capitalism, Swift on a never-ending conveyor belt between the stage and the studio. This is the Swift that brings us The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, maximally bloated with 15 (15!) additional songs. Those that stand out mostly do so for the wrong reasons: There’s the one that borrows its premise from Olivia Rodrigo, but executes it less skillfully; the one where Swift dwells on her resentment toward Kim Kardashian; the one with that weird lyric about racism in the 1830s. This data-dump release strategy is not at all unique to Swift; it’s a concession to the modern music economy, which incentivizes artists to batch as many songs as possible, in as many packages as possible, to juice streams and sales. I look back fondly on the more modest tactics of “Our Song,” the last track on Swift’s debut, where she literally sang “play it again” in the final chorus. If Swift believes that output for its own sake is what she has to offer, she underestimates her gift. Listeners who believe that her every ounce of experience is inherently interesting—because she was the one to have it—misunderstand her as well. Taylor Swift doesn’t need a whole album to tell the story of a relationship; she only needs one song, sometimes even one line. She almost has it in Tortured Poets’ title track, with the tossed-off brilliance of “We’re modern idiots.” She’s nearly there with the vignette, which needs a bit more burnishing, about her man slipping a ring from her middle to her eager left ring finger at dinner. You can see what she’s chasing here: the moment in time that triggers a flash of feeling that lasts forever—the sort of thing people call Swiftian. We’ve been students of Swift’s poetry for years. The lesson of The Tortured Poets Department is not to push through the pain—it’s to take the time to process it. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Tom Verlaine,Warm and Cool / Around / Songs and Other Things,6.4,"Experimental / Rock Reviewed: September 24, 2024 When Tom Verlaine died last year, the guitar legend had made far more albums as a solo artist than he had with his erstwhile band Television, but most obituaries treated his solo career as an afterthought. This is understandable. With 1977’s sublime Marquee Moon, Verlaine didn’t just carve out a new framework for a post-Hendrix American guitar god; his band also landed in the right place and time, personifying the aloof cool of the CBGB scene and becoming punk icons largely by association. The album’s songs and performances made it an enduring classic, but its mythology is part of what drew younger listeners in. Verlaine’s mostly excellent solo albums carry no such mythology. They are works of an elusive individualist. After dissolving Television in 1978, the frontman was never again part of a legible scene—never caught in a zeitgeist, never anchored to a trend. His 1979 self-titled LP, which picked up where Television left off, was a critical hit and yielded a David Bowie cover of “Kingdom Come,” but Verlaine’s more outré work has long fallen between the cracks. Casual fans may be unaware of just how far the musician strayed from his signature sound on brilliant albums like 1982’s Words From the Front, which closes with a hypnotic nine-minute alien-pop groove, or 1984’s synth-colored Cover, which reintroduces Verlaine as an icy romantic crooner on gems like “O Foolish Heart.” While those records remain sadly neglected, Real Gone Music is doing the Lord’s work by reissuing Verlaine’s last three albums on vinyl and making them available to stream for the first time. The reissue campaign covers the final chapter of Verlaine’s recording career, as his solo output became sporadic and live reunions with Television more frequent: a pair of instrumental albums, 1992’s Warm and Cool and 2006’s Around, and one last, shall we say, traditional album, Songs and Other Things, also from 2006. While not Verlaine’s most vital work, these releases help tie up loose ends in his discography and spotlight a jazzier mode of his six-string brilliance. In particular, Warm and Cool, recorded primarily with bassist Patrick Derivaz and Television drummer Billy Ficca, could be classified more accurately as guitar jazz than rock. It’s a tapestry of mood pieces—some ambient and brooding (“The Deep Dark Clouds,” “Spiritual”), some playful and melodic (“Boulevard,” “Little Dance”). During its final stretch, Verlaine unleashes a pair of stormy improvisations—the five-minute “Ore” and nearly seven-minute “Lore”—which eschew the elegant melodicism of his Television solos in favor of scraping dissonance, reflecting the guitarist’s roots as a teenaged saxophonist who loved Coltrane. Those pieces have more in common with the free-jazz eruptions of Sonny Sharrock than with Verlaine’s punk peers. In liner notes prepared for this reissue, Verlaine’s longtime partner, Jutta Koether, describes Warm and Cool in near-mystical terms, calling it “a turn towards the power of faith/s” and writing that Verlaine had been considering this “flight into the instrumental zone” for years. In retrospect, the album’s 1992 release feels like a warm-up for the more fleshed-out songs on Television’s reunion LP, released later that year. Warm and Cool feels more like incidental music without, well, accompanying incident. On the slow and steady “Those Harbor Lights,” Verlaine plays like he’s soundtracking a spaghetti Western in his head; on meandering cuts like “Saucer Crash” and “Depot (1951),” his solos are expressive as ever but lack the sense of drama or purpose they have when anchored to more traditional songwriting. The tracks simply start, amble along, and then end. After 1992, Verlaine gradually receded from the public eye. Appearances were sparse. Disillusioned with the grinding routine of touring, he kept live commitments to a minimum. He contributed to Patti Smith’s 1996 comeback album, Gone Again, and lent some music to a little-seen Renée Zellweger film, Love and a .45. He also met Jeff Buckley, who hired him to produce what would have been Buckley’s second album, My Sweetheart the Drunk, though the singer became dissatisfied with the tracks and planned to re-record the material, sans Verlaine, before his untimely death. Amid this doomed collaboration with Buckley, Verlaine entered the studio on his own to record Around. A second instrumental album, Around was tracked over two days in late 1996, according to Koether’s liner notes, then shelved. For reasons unexplained, it wouldn’t see release until a decade later. A loose sister album to Warm and Cool—again recorded with the core trio of Derivaz and Ficca—Around finds Verlaine drifting deeper into the ambient-guitar wilderness. While Warm and Cool felt a bit scattershot, traversing from style to style, Around vibrates and hums like a mood piece from start to finish. Verlaine’s solos are the main attraction, but he has never played as delicately as he does here—tapping and fluttering around the higher reaches of his fretboard on “Mountain,” wailing out mournful melodies on “Candle,” and using a slide to achieve what sounds like a desert prayer on “The Suns Gliding!” If Around has little to offer fans of Verlaine’s rock roots, that’s what makes it interesting. It’s a total departure from anything he had done before, with odd little excursions—the slinky Eastern funk of “Rain, Sidewalk,” the vaguely tropical pitter-patter of “Meteor Beach”—serving as testament to his musical curiosity. It’s no great exaggeration to say Verlaine was putting his own spin on spiritual jazz (indeed, Koether’s liner notes reference his fondness for an Albert Ayler box set). But at 16 tracks, the album overstays its welcome and, at times, slips into aimlessness. There are plenty of pieces that would work great soundtracking some ’90s art-house neo-noir but remain less than engaging on record. “A Burned Letter,” for instance, may make you wonder why Verlaine never broke into Jim Jarmusch’s rolodex the way Neil Young did—Verlaine could have had a second career as a film composer. (He did, in fact, enjoy a regular side hustle creating new scores for European silent films from the 1920s.) By the time this music finally hit stores, Verlaine had completed another Television reunion cycle and signed to Thrill Jockey, which released both Around and Songs and Other Things in the spring of 2006 after label founder Bettina Richards convinced him to record again. (“I liked recording, but I wasn’t much in the mood to do it until a couple years ago,” Verlaine told the New York Times.) An unexpected return after a 14-year drought of new material, this dual release would mark his final dispatch as a solo artist. Songs and Other Things was the first and only album Verlaine recorded after a new generation of arty New York bands began borrowing from Television’s spindly aesthetic and reigniting interest in the downtown scene from which they emerged. Verlaine’s cultural stock had undoubtedly risen between 1996 and 2006. But unlike generational peers Bowie and David Byrne, Verlaine evinced little interest in collaborating with buzzy younger acts or pitching himself to a new generation of fans. He told the Times he heard little of his own influence in bands like the Strokes and said he spent his time listening to 12th-century nun Hildegard von Bingen instead. Nor, from the sound of Songs and Other Things, was he interested in capitalizing on whatever CBGB nostalgia the Strokes had summoned forth. It’s an odd little album, twitchy and paranoid, with a loose specter of dark eroticism weaving through the material. Singing on record for the first time in 14 years, he delivers his vocals in a detached mumble. The effect is intriguing and often inscrutable, with Verlaine retreating from the relatively pop moves of 1990’s The Wonder (though, according to Koether, some of these song ideas dated back to that era). On “Heavenly Charm,” he drawls sly come-ons before the song erupts in an uncharacteristically distorted climax, then peters out before the three-minute mark. On “A Stroll,” he warps the record’s prettiest ballad with a strained, marble-mouthed delivery. It seems to be a love song, but Verlaine sings as though its sentiment is too private for public consumption. At its best, Songs plays like a tapestry of grooves and cryptic mantras. “Nice Actress” is stormy and menacing, with Verlaine muttering, “Never said you was some fucked-up actor/But there is a hidden factor” over a depraved surf-rock lick. “Shingaling” is a slinky funk workout driven by drummer Jay Dee Daugherty’s relentlessly syncopated shuffle and Verlaine’s titular gibberish phrase. “All Weirded Out,” performed live as early as 1996, is a straight-ahead rocker in the spirit of 1981’s Dreamtime, while “The Day on You” is a droning vamp that becomes a vehicle for concurrent guitar solos, all fluttering filigrees and quivering whines, that multiply like Gremlins. The album winds to a close with a loping, undercooked instrumental called “Peace Piece,” and then that’s a wrap on Tom Verlaine’s solo career. After 2006, he seemingly lost interest in making records. Throughout the 2010s, he continued performing live with Television, where unrecorded tracks like “Persia” routinely graced the setlist, but the band’s long-rumored fourth album never surfaced. During his final years, Verlaine moved through New York like a ghost. He went unrecognized by the masses, but you could find him lurking outside the Strand for hours, smoking in an overcoat as he thumbed through volumes of Buddhist poetry or shot the breeze with Thurston Moore. He had zero interest in the celebrity that accompanied being a rock legend. He maintained a low profile, rarely made public appearances beyond Television’s sporadic tours and festival sets, never used social media, and stopped giving interviews (I tried). He communicated, in other words, solely through his music. And on these three albums, his guitar had a lot to say, even as the man himself seemed to be receding into the shadows.

DORIS,Ultimate Love Songs Collection,8.3,Rap,"At a June event commemorating Anysia Kym’s Truest, DORIS rasped breathily over his own floor-rumbling tracks: a curious spectacle, considering that his “floor-rumbling tracks” are woozy bedroom ballads, less Mike Dean than Dean Blunt. Take “Usher,” the airy one-off single he dropped via MIKE’s 10k label three years ago. A languid Enchantment loop longs for “Gloria, my Gloria” while DORIS dawdles through the mix, chirping about weed—listen closely and you can hear him choking on the smoke. It’s beautiful in an unpolished way, like early Ariel Pink or R. Stevie Moore sending heartfelt prayers through hissing mics. Now picture him onstage, swaddled in feedback, speaker rattles, and the bitcrush of his own cranked-up backing track, no longer whispering but screaming through songs that lend themselves to silent weeping. Raw passion permeates even his breeziest, most distant dreamscapes. “Real and straight up,” he said in a recent interview: “That’s what I want to be, 100 percent of the time.” DORIS is Frank Dorrey, a Jersey-raised multi-hyphenate who first came to public attention as a visual artist whose uncanny portraits have adorned album sleeves and limited-edition skate decks. His few press appearances portray him as a cerebral recluse, happier to speak from a SoundCloud account than a soapbox. The statements he made from said SoundCloud account were surreal—fleeting fever dreams that rode the same psychedelic highs as his eerie, amorphous Picsart prints. He chose the name DORIS partly as an homage to Earl Sweatshirt: an artsy young introvert resonating with the mastermind behind I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside. Dorrey is still somewhat shy, but he’s stepping out more often. (Pitchfork caught up with him earlier this year at the opening of a joint art exhibition with Brayan Ramales.) He’s also gotten far more comfortable in his own voice—comfortable enough to drop a sprawling 50-track opus without stumbling across the same idea twice. Last month, he independently released Ultimate Love Songs Collection, a glut of lo-fi demos largely ripped from his SoundCloud. It scans a lot like other ambitious hard drive clean-outs, à la Roaches 2012-2019 or Sent From My Telephone, but manages to remain intimate—and wildly fun—where the “longform idea dump” genre so runs aground. Ultimate Love Songs Collection doesn’t feel low-effort or self-aggrandizing—it shares the cathartic release of singing in the shower. “I’m just riding on the beat, I just like the way it sounds,” a giddy DORIS admits on “Baby reign,” audibly lost in the sauce. Unlike much of underground rap’s young vanguard, he isn’t cosplaying his influences so much as performing simple passions: his own company, the songs he’s stoked on, and the weed he’s smoking while trying to loop his favorite parts. Deep as it sits within his universe, the music is familiar enough to nestle comfortably within ours. Here’s the scene: DORIS hunched over a laptop long after midnight, tangled in wires from a mic, a charger, a pair of headphones, and a Focusrite. The only light source is his screen, and if he doesn’t close all those YouTube-to-MP3 tabs, it might just go out. Ultimate Love Songs Collection has the drowsy fuck-it affect of a savant on his last sip of Celsius. Dorrey’s phlegmy whisper bridges the gap between Whole Lotta Red’s rage-rasp and The Unseen’s quirky up-pitch, like an imaginary friend with something stuck in their throat. His appetite for samples expands on the air of red-eyed curiosity, revisiting traces of soul music heard through parents’ crackly radios, alt-rock earworms playing from cracked iPhones, and young-adult angst drowned out by airy hypnagogic pop. One second, he’s chipmunk-squeaking over the Cardigans’ “Lovefool”; the next, he’s coughing out congested romance epics, regaling weed over melodies more famous for regaling girls from Ipanema. All the while, he’s endearingly candid, like a kid who got one of those T-Pain mics for Christmas—bedroom or studio, he just wants to say the first thing that comes to mind. What makes Ultimate Love Songs Collection so rewarding, even relatable, is the way it wears this bare, ragtag enthusiasm on its sleeves—stripping away pretense so all that’s left is a snapshot of the moment DORIS decided he fucked with a certain song. Today’s underground hip-hop is less interested in consistency than radical, relentless knob-pushing: dialing up the echo, amplifying the distortion, kindling flames of anarchy and fetching gasoline. DORIS shares his contemporaries’ knack for frenzied creation, but he also doesn’t move like there’s anything especially shocking or marketable behind his madness. No occult poses, no indie sleaze revival, no punk aesthetic rehashed for a new generation: He just wants to wail his own love songs over the ones stuck in head.",1,"August 5, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/doris-ultimate-love-songs-collection/
Klein,marked,7.1,Experimental,"More than once, the shapeshifting experimental musician Klein has joked with interviewers that her next move will be toward the mainstream—a hip-hop album, a drill album, signing to Roc Nation, moving to L.A. to become an Oscar-winning actress. And every time, she’ll return with a record that sounds like a church organ gaining sentience in a Category 3 hurricane, or something just as dubiously marketable. It’s a revealing setup, though, because the South London artist has consistently positioned herself as an outsider to the walled-off world of the avant-garde, more schooled in Hot 97 hits than the underground artists—Dean Blunt, Mica Levi—to whom she was initially compared. Eight albums into Klein’s discography, that claim gets harder to back up. She’s performed at London’s Barbican and ICA, adapted her own stage musical into a film, and has Björk’s number saved in her contacts. And yet, as her brilliantly weird live performances attest, Klein still defies categorization. On marked she doubles down, restricting herself almost entirely to a palette of blistering guitar squall that you’d more likely associate with the anti-rock extremism of Wolf Eyes and Aaron Dilloway. Technically, she’s explored this sound before. “top shotta,” from 2022’s Cave in the Wind, could be a lost bootleg of an Einstürzende Neubauten soundcheck; “grit,” from 2020’s Frozen, sounds like a far-off cement mixer munching down on a Telecaster. But on marked, almost every minute is claimed by Klein’s guitar, distorted to oblivion and shuddering with feedback. Overdriven riffs burn holes in the VU meter on “gully creepa,” opening a portal to a nightmarish loop that’s half dub soundsystem, half doom metal. Muddy drones are juxtaposed against trebly scrapings and blown-out drum machines on “Blow the Whistle”—a leap into heavy new territory for Klein, but one that will feel familiar to fans of JK Flesh and Dreamcrusher. It’s tempting to interpret the mood as one of anguished introspection. On “more than like” she goes swimming in an inky pool of piano, sinking into the sustained low notes, despondent. That’s followed by the extended circular drones of “enemy of the state,” where serrated chords are slowly mulched into one enormous slug of noise, à la Glenn Branca’s guitar orchestra. Klein’s signature flamboyant vocal runs are largely absent from the album; ditto the patched-in supporting voices that often populate her dreamy narratives. Exceptions come near the end on three a cappella fragments: the voice-note R&B of “frontin,” an off-the-cuff mini-duet with La Timpa titled “neek,” and the closing “exclusive.” Flipping the script on the entire album, “exclusive” is pure, unmistakable Klein—hyper-melismatic vocals, a pitch-shifted loop over ticking trap drums, a snotty rap (repurposed from “black famous,” on last year’s touched by an angel): “I just look around and what do I see/Another mini me,” she spits through crackling Auto-Tune, “Sweet girl big dreams/They call her fleabag.” The contrast with the previous 45 minutes is like pressing a bag of frozen peas against a bruise. The lingering question is whether these diversions into burly guitar noise are remarkable in their own right, or interesting mainly because Klein is the author. There’s certainly something endearing about an artist feeling her way into a genre apparently by accident. “I’ve always made stuff without thinking of anyone else,” she said in 2021. “I’ve never had time to think about what I’m doing or what this means.” Whether or not you buy that claim, such confidence in the process, in the freedom of not knowing, is worth dwelling on at a time when so much experimental music—and culture, in general—is delivered with a thud of literalism, wearing all its subtext on its sleeves.",0,"July 31, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/klein-marked/
Zach Bryan,The Great American Bar Scene,7.0,Folk/Country,"Some songwriters have a direct line from their open wounds to the pen on the page, and then there’s Zach Bryan. His 2019 self-produced, self-released debut album, DeAnn, was named after his mother, who died of complications related to alcoholism when Bryan was 20. Recorded during his time as an aviation ordnanceman in the Navy, its ragged songs detail grief and regret, devotion that leads to violence, family curses and hard-won redemption. Bryan’s passion and pathos garnered him a cult following that turned him into a stadium-filling superstar, and though he now records and travels with a full band—not to mention guest stars like Maggie Rogers, Bruce Springsteen, and the “Hawk Tuah” girl—his work still carries the stark intensity and emotional bareness of a heart-to-heart with a stranger after one too many beers. His new album, The Great American Bar Scene, adds to the Zach Bryan formula by taking on a wider lens, weaving his personal struggles and triumphs into the greater legacy of lost souls and camaraderie found in America’s watering holes. This can lead to exciting new lyrical territory for him, like on “Oak Island,” a tightly wound character song about a railroad worker whose brother’s gotten into trouble with some boys from New Jersey. His protagonist, Mickey, also appears on the title track—this time as a nod to malt liquor—in a story that starts off with getting played by a bookie from Philly, winds through a police chase in Cheyenne, and ends with swaying to Johnny Cash with some sweet young thing under neon lights. In the background, you can hear the ambient sound of balls clanking in a game of pool, timed to the strums of the guitar. It’s all very Nebraska, a comparison that’s hung over Bryan since his early lo-fi releases. He even tries to get ahead of the punchline here, with references to “State Trooper” and “Reason to Believe” and a duet with the Boss himself on “Sandpaper.” Ironically, the sound of Bar Scene is the most full-bodied of Bryan’s career, building upon the heartland rock that he explored in his 2022 major-label breakthrough American Heartbreak and the self-titled follow-up from last year. Bryan makes the kind of production choices here associated with someone gaining a lot more money and creative control in a short amount of time, deploying mariachi horns, gospel choirs and, yes, a John Mayer guitar solo to complete his vision. They mostly work, though maybe not surprisingly, Bryan’s folksier instincts shine the most: the moments of lonesome pedal steel and guitar-pickin’, the skilled harmonies with Noeline Hofmann on “Purple Gas,” and the showstopping harmonica on “Pink Skies.” That song, an account of DeAnn’s funeral, is so meticulously constructed that you can see exactly why, against all odds, it was picked as the album’s lead single. Bryan has expressed stubbornness, even pride, in continuing to release albums that extend past an hour. While the drawn-out onslaught of emotions can set up a uniquely cathartic experience, it starts to wear thin on Bar Scene, where well-crafted tracks bump up against half-baked ghosts of past Bryan songs. “Bass Boat” sounds like an attempt at recapturing the magic of the two-part ballad “Jake’s Piano - Long Island” from last year, but apart from one particularly devastating line—“I was raised by a woman who was hardly impressed/And I carry that shit real deep in my chest”—it never quite reaches the same heights. Bryan sometimes trades jarring specificity for more general platitudes, such as, “Don’t get angry, listen to the sounds/Them good times will find their way back around,” on “Better Days.” Even when he gets into the details, he tends to lean on nostalgic signifiers—Beale Street and Elvis quotes, old Fords and Tom & Jerry, Trans-Am and Kodachrome—in place of more substantive meaning. There have been many comparisons made between Bryan and Morgan Wallen, the other streaming giant of country music, unabashedly more conservative than Bryan but also a fan of long albums, wistful reminiscing, and authentic presentation. But there are arguably many more similarities between him and Tyler Childers, the Appalachian singer-songwriter whom Bryan shouts out on the very last line of Bar Scene, or Colter Wall, the gruff-voiced plainsman from Saskatchewan, whose song “Motorcycle” Bryan recently covered on his Instagram Story. All three of these men combine a reverence for country traditionalism with the outlaw attitude of the 1970s, to the extent where, when Bryan rails against “808s” infiltrating the country charts on “Bathwater,” it feels redundant. But if artists like Bryan can match, or even surpass, the stardom of Nashville’s revolving door of country-pop singers, then what exactly is he rallying against? Bryan is now, reluctantly or not, the biggest crossover success in the industry, long past the point of being able to call himself an underdog. “I’m a mechanical bull, throw a quarter and watch me go,” he mutters, with a shrug, early on Bar Scene. You get the sense that, if given the chance, Bryan would fast-forward through all this “fame” business and become a barroom staple, with the kind of songs that people sing along to because their parents did. Only time will tell if he ever reaches that point; as Bryan would know, it takes a few decades to earn a permanent spot in the jukebox.

Sia,Reasonable Woman,5.5,Pop/R&B,"Sia’s voice is a titanic instrument that swerves between sorrow and euphoria in the same octave-spanning measure. Since her 2014 breakthrough, 1000 Forms of Fear, the Australian star’s career has spanned big-ticket electropop collaborations with the likes of Diplo, Zayn, Flo Rida, and Sean Paul, as well as her own passion projects. Over the past decade, her sound fully morphed from the quietly crushing indie pop of early records to produce glossy mainstream hits, including both giddy highs and some forgettable lows. Reasonable Woman, the singer’s 10th studio album, continues the trend of inconsistency. Over manicured synth arrangements and beat drops blown up to eye-watering proportions, Sia belts out self-help anthems that stick to formulaic, dated sounds. It’s outsized feel-good music with little worth feeling good about. Reasonable Woman follows 2021’s Music, the soundtrack to the singer’s misguided directorial debut of the same name. Both a critical and commercial flop, Music might suggest that Sia has something to prove. Yet few songs on Reasonable Woman summon the concentrated adrenaline and idiosyncratic lyrics that animate her best music. (Even the tepid title makes it feel as though she’s managing expectations upfront.) The chorus that’s meant to juice up motivational opener “Little Wing” weds Sia’s grandiose vocals to basic lyrics: “My little wing/I know you can’t stop crying/But tears dry up when you’re flying,” she sings in a soaring upper register, sounding as though she’s still scoring a forgettable film. On the more memorable ballad “I Had a Heart,” co-written with Rosalía, she reaches deeper, and her unvarnished performance revels in the weathered grain of her voice. Dealing out forgiveness after a breakup, she relinquishes some of the album’s pomp and gradually finds a more moving, if still treacly, sweet spot. More often, pomp seems to be the point. Reasonable Woman is an overproduced amalgamation of disco, hip-hop, and radio pop that even Sia’s gale-force delivery can only carry so far. The wobbly dubstep drop on the anonymous single “Incredible,” featuring Sia’s LSD partner Labrinth, sounds teleported from 2014. The stomping, rafters-aiming “Gimme Love” grates as it makes the titular request 12 times in a chorus. Chaka Khan’s verses on the souped-up, Greg Kurstin-produced “Immortal Queen” are so incomprehensible they’re almost camp, combining references to The Matrix, “cavemen bringing the cave queen carvings,” and Queens Victoria and Sheba. It makes no more sense in context, ping-ponging between uninspired synth arpeggios, than it does on paper. And on the truly dire Paris Hilton duet “Fame Won’t Love You,” Sia delivers achingly sincere lyrics about the trials of celebrity beside one of Y2K’s most flavorless personalities. The guitar-tinged synth-pop feels airless. There’s no forward motion, no tension—both key to the rapturous feelings evoked by Sia’s most energetic, soaring songs. She finds a more worthy match in Kylie Minogue on the breathy, strutting “Dance Alone,” an electropop highlight that shares DNA with Minogue’s recent Tension and readily invites comparison to Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own,” still the gold standard for this particular flavor of bittersweet bliss. It’s an issue that plagues Reasonable Woman: The germ of a better idea often appears within reach. That’s true of songs like the pleasure-seeking “One Night,” where bizarre, Timbaland-esque rhythmic strings propose a more interesting angle on swaggering dance-R&B. It happens again on the closing ballad “Rock and Balloon,” with the simple, metronomic synth that winds through the background and finally dissipates into an acoustic guitar melody. Those wrinkles of strangeness—whether in production, vocals, or instrumentation—are traces of a stronger album that the incoherent Reasonable Woman quickly abandons for the next drop.

Sega Bodega,Dennis,7.2,Electronic,"On March 12, 1951, Hank Ketcham debuted Dennis the Menace in the Post-Hall Syndicate, which supplied content to newspapers across America. In the UK, on the same day, David Law published a comic strip of the same name in The Beano, a children’s magazine. The odd anecdote inspired the title of Sega Bodega’s third and latest album, Dennis. For Sega, aka Salvador Navarrete, the coincidence is a precursor to what today we might call the internet hive mind. “I have this theory that all of our brains are connected to a machine that is pumping out information to all of us all at the same time,” Navarrete told Interview. His statement might bring smartphones to mind, but the Irish-Chilean producer means something more enigmatic, predating Google and social media—closer to divine fate than a viral meme. Dennis is the most recent entry in Sega Bodega’s increasingly personal body of work, framed through his singular lens of murky, club-ready pop and confessional lyrics. Where Navarrete has always balanced ballads and euphoric production, often in the same song, on Dennis the line is practically nonexistent. From the one-two punch of early standouts “Adulter8” and “Elk Skin,” Dennis puts dark pop in the service of visceral pleasure, pairing addictive, tactile synth arpeggios with muffled vocals and acoustic guitars. Inspired by Luca Guadagnino’s Suspiria (see “Tears & Sighs,” whose title comes from two of the Three Mothers), sleepless nights, lethargic days, and the internet’s omnipresence, Dennis is an album of floor-fillers, especially in its first half, that plays out like a bad hangover, one song shifting into the next like Dante passing through the circles of Hell. Where other artists might shy from fusing acoustic and electronic sounds so closely, Navarette embraces them as equally worthy of attention, although his palette is distinctly digital in color. Much as in his contribution to Caroline Polachek’s “Sunset,” trance motifs and acoustic guitars effortlessly converge, particularly on “Elk Skin” and “Tears & Sighs.” Dennis is more playful than Navarrete’s first two albums, incorporating cryptic spoken-word “sleep talking” interludes from Miranda July and others. “Elk Skin” opens with a Greek fan asking Navarrete to sample her voice; “Dirt” concludes with July repeating, “My water bottle is bird transition”—the kind of “beautiful nonsense,” Navarrete has said, that “comes out when someone is absolutely comatose.” He seems to be using these voices more for their sonics than for the words’ literal meanings; the same applies to Navarrete’s lyrics, which take a back seat to his dazzling, sometimes unpredictable production. While pulling inspiration from Dennis the Menace, the album’s title is also meant as a reversal of “sinned,” since Heaven, angels, and salvation have always been some of Navarrete’s lyrical preoccupations. But for cosmic, existential concerns, Navarrete is equally drawn to macabre body horror and foreboding titles that suggest a suffocating sense of dread. “Humiliation Doesn’t Leave a Mark” and “Set Me Free, I’m an Animal” both convey a vague kind of emotional harm that’s largely left unexplained. But dig deeper into the album’s dream logic, and a wounded desire for intimacy and connection emerges from its byzantine, watery depths. An expression of Navarrete’s search for communion in the global collective consciousness, Dennis—with its euphoric trance synths and nods to club music’s global lingua franca—speaks to the utopian potential of electronic music’s hive mind.",0,"May 1, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sega-bodega-dennis/
The Bug,Machine,7.6,Electronic,"After years spent as dubstep’s noir weird uncle, Kevin Martin is getting reacquainted with his original vocation: maker of head music for headbangers. His seventh album as the Bug, 2021’s Fire, was a welcome return to the corrosive industrial ragga of his ’00s output, after years of desolation trip-hop and Black-Ark-gone-Black-Lodge murkscapes. The Zonal project reconnected him with Godflesh pummeler Justin Broadrick for some scorched-Earth drones. A pair of crucial reissues of the duo’s aggro-illbient collaboration Techno Animal emerged courtesy of extreme metal label Relapse Records. The latest release from the ever-prolific funcrusher makes his last 15 years of dystopian dub and gray-toned “dream noise” sound like a Carnival cruise to Montego Bay. Machine is an anthology of five digital EPs Martin constructed as “floor weapons” for his 10-bassbin Pressure parties at Berlin’s Gretchen club and other gigs. Martin’s first non-collaborative instrumental outing as the Bug, Machine is inspired by the oppressive volume of both reggae soundsystem clashes and Swans shows, a full-contact sound arsenal made to churn bowels, vibrate molecules, and push air. Martin remains a master of post-apocalyptic textures and all manner of swirling digital gunk, but while nuance is here in droves, it’s not exactly the draw. Like other uniquely extreme albums—Napalm Death’s Scum, Merzbow’s Pulse Demon, or the Cherry Point’s Night of the Bloody Tapes—it feels like the victory of some kind of arms race. Martin’s bass tones are preposterously low. His basslines are kaiju-sized, rubbery, detuned, screwed sounding. Opener “Annihilated (Force of Gravity)” is lurchy to a degree where it sounds like Korn’s bassist pinch-hitting for Flipper. Machine feels unsafe at any volume. The 12-track version, available on streaming services or two LPs of splattery vinyl, is an ample distillation of the project’s mix of hypnosis and malevolence. The sluggy pace, the Jah Wobble-on-Codeine basslines, and the cavernous, almost physical echos make it “dub music” in the most general sense, but Martin’s palette more closely resembles clanging factories, smoking engines, foghorns, freight elevators, hissing steam, and scratchy Basic Channel records. “Shafted (Laws of Attraction/Repulsion)” starts with digital church bells—a modern retelling of the first Black Sabbath LP. “Sickness (Slowly Dying)” sounds like it’s been forged from vinyl static; “Vertical (Never See You Again)” feels like an Ampex reel being drawn and quartered; and “Departed (Left the Body Behind)” unnerves with some sort of distorted digital wail attempting to make contact. Machine exists somewhere between the flicker of lost memory and the adrenaline-fueled panic of impending doom: It crackles like hauntology, but electrifies like ghostbusting. Presented in chronological order, the album concludes with three tracks from February’s Machine V EP, the moment the robots become sentient and start discovering sick riffs. Album highlight “Buried (Your Life Is Short)” could be dutifully covered by a groove-metal band like Pantera or Prong. “Bodied (Send for the Hearse)” sounds like Khanate test-driving wind machines. Closer “Exit (Wasteman)” is pure robot sludge metal. The full 21-track version of Machine—running 87 minutes across 2 CDs or a limited pressing of 5 LPs—is, understandably… a lot. The extra nine tracks muck about in too-similar irradiated swamps to make any of them truly essential, though serious bass freaks get some worthy little detours like the GAS-style ambient of “Released (The Need to Escape),” the nightmare footwork of “Fucka (Tongue as a Weapon)” and “Limbo (Lust and Paralysis),” which sounds like the “Sleng Teng” riddim being lowered into battery acid. Like other landmarks of sonic warfare, Machine is custom-built to test the limits of both speakers and sanity. Somewhere between King Tubby and King Buzzo, Machine may not have the irresistible grooves of 2003’s Pressure or the political resonance of 2008’s landmark London Zoo, but—by thudding leaps and earthquaking bounds—is easily the heaviest, ugliest, paint-peelingest record in an already seismic discography.

Dummy,Free Energy,8.0,Rock,"In thermodynamics, “free energy” is a measure of available power and spontaneity, how much potential heat and spark can be unleashed in the space of a reaction. Even if it might initially give you some pause to take a physics lesson from a group called Dummy, it’s an apt metaphor for the creative alchemy on the Los Angeles band’s second full-length album. Hard-won originality and explosive release are central to the group’s appeal; its songs are endlessly evocative yet utterly distinct. On Free Energy, Dummy have distilled their influences into music that’s as free-floating and airy as it is scorchingly combustible, weaving pummeling shoegaze guitar, dissonant electronics, and serene pockets of jazzy ambience into expertly crafted psych-pop. Dummy’s wide-ranging sound reflects a rigorous study and synthesis of their wildly eclectic forebears: My Bloody Valentine by way of Laraaji, Stereolab by way of The Byrds. Even at their most joyfully immediate, Dummy take a perverse glee in emphasizing just how easy their music isn’t: “Making music shouldn’t be fun” is the group’s long-time Bandcamp bio, never mind that they called their debut Mandatory Enjoyment. This deadpan-dourness is both a long-running joke and a reminder that the originality the band yields is no accident but a product of highly disciplined work. Where the greatness of Mandatory Enjoyment was in how successfully the group collaged its influences, on Free Energy, Dummy succeeds in burning away those raw edges altogether, resulting in an unbound sound that’s unmistakably their own. Free Energy is a record of altered states made incredibly fun and navigable. Dummy’s songwriting is cryptic and fragmentary, grappling from moment to moment with turbulent emotions as they blaze to the fore. There’s traces of the same meta cleverness that defined their last LP, especially on “Unshaped Road” which dramatizes the thrill and exhaustion of indie rockers: “Empty pockets feel pure…Feeling the weight/Begging for more each day/Come find me/Haven’t had enough yet.” But more often, the songs are multicolor free-falls into dreamy or unsettling landscapes. Many of the titles are drawn (Grimes-like) from advanced physics and niche video game references, which give the impression of cohesive, if bizarro, world-building. “Minus World,” for instance, is a study of dawning panic that, if looked at sideways, also doubles as a first person-account of being stranded in the infamous Super Mario Bros. glitch level. This dislocation is reinforced by the thrilling instability of the music itself. “Unshaped Road” pulls a production trick worthy of Kevin Shields, building the song out over a bruising bass tone that gradually tilts off its axis until the only accompaniment to Alex Ewell’s athletic drumming is a squall of roaring feedback. In “Nullspace,” Joe Trainor’s hard-driving guitar riff is made to surf over rubbery synths that sound like a cartoon character perpetually slipping on an oil slick. Like a hypnotist’s cue, the recurrence of a pinging synth loop on “Soonish…” prompts the band to rage and recede on cue. Dummy’s earlier work could impressively modulate between spacy ambience and blistering noise; on Free Energy, they ride these dizzying dynamic shifts even more wildly and gracefully. Like scientists working with volatile materials, the band demonstrates a firm understanding of the limits a pop song can tolerate as they segue from turbulence to tranquility and back again. “Sudden Flutes” lives up to its name, and after a frenzied attack, the song cleaves in two, shifting from hard-charging rock to a beatific instrumental courtesy of Cole Pulice. With “Blue Dada” and “Psychic Battery,” the group conjures a woozy lushness reminiscent of acts like Seefeel and Bowery Electric, a sonic bubble bath compared to the instrumental violence elsewhere. On “Dip in the Lake,” which recalls Disco Inferno and is easily a contender for Dummy’s most beautiful song to date, Nathan O’Dell sings of marveling at a lover’s face through flickering piano samples and gentle guitar work as though he were catching it from gorgeous new angles in the sunlight. O’Dell’s suave, affectless voice is perfectly at home on the record’s more psychedelic songs. But Emma Maatman’s vocals are the real standout on Free Energy, and one of the band’s most successful adjustments is pushing her gorgeous, expressive tone to the fore. While O’Dell coolly surfs the music, she embodies all of its vaporous tension: by turns stoic, wistful, pissed-off, and wonder-struck, yet always commanding. Maatman created the record’s cover art, inspired by lyrics written from the perspective of a woman seeking emotional clarity in an unstable relationship. As the band builds to an ecstatic peak on “Blue Dada,” she cries, “All the answers I’ve been seeking/It shines through/Kaleidoscope behind a burst balloon.” It’s the sound of a band turning all its potential energy into music that’s dazzlingly kinetic and powerful.  All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Honey Dijon,DJ-Kicks: Honey Dijon,7.7,Electronic,"Few people are as cool as Honey Dijon. The epitome of the superstar DJ, she lives the glamorous life, playing art fairs and fashion parties, and taking Polaroids with celebrities. She counts Madonna and Beyoncé as fans. She has a residency at Panorama Bar and started a new one in Ibiza this past month. She even has a Commes des Garçons line, and she’s always dressed to kill no matter what time of day or night it is. She’s what the word “iconic” was coined for. But Honey Dijon is also a nerd, and she probably knows more about music than anyone else in the room. Growing up steeped in Chicago’s house music scene, and later New York, she started clubbing as a teenager alongside fellow future DJs like Derrick Carter. She has a crazy record collection and an even crazier recall for house tracks, and she knows how to play for almost any audience, whether it’s a tiny bar or a gigantic festival stage. Her mass appeal—she plays bold, bouncy house music—belies her love of obscure and often weird tracks. She calls herself a “big fan of research,” and she used her long-deserved entry in the DJ-Kicks mix series to explore the outer reaches of her sound and into a land of off-key vocals, cheeky horns, and more bongos than you knew you needed. Her DJ-Kicks functions like an alternate history of house music, where a track like Psychedelic Research Lab’s “Keep On Climbin’ (Mix 2)” is an acid anthem and Maydie Miles’ “Keep On Luvin” was featured in a pivotal Sex & the City scene. Dijon sheds light on lesser-known names like Michi Lange and the Dance Kings, whose “Climb the Walls” is another highlight, with an insistent hook that mixes joy, frustration, and anger over a galloping beat. There are darker moments, like the deeply paranoid Mr. Marvin remix of Johnny Dangerous’ “Dear Father in Heaven,” but for the most part the mix cruises through catchy hook after catchy hook, from the bizarre manipulated vocals on Cassio the Cassmaster’s “Getting Hot (Broad & Market Street Mix)” to D:Ream’s 1992 smash “U R the Best Thing.” That’s the other thing about Honey Dijon: She knows that some of the most mainstream dance cuts still hit, especially when you balance them with the stranger stuff. There’s a retro tinge to Honey Dijon’s DJ-Kicks—a lot of this music is from the ’90s—but that’s also because her taste and style is as timeless as her signature leather jackets. Even the new tracks she plays are vintage in spirit: Waajeed’s glowing, Rhodes-dotted “Right Now” is from 2022 but sounds straight out of the mid-’90s, and her own “Finding My Way” is a pitch-perfect vocal house track in the vein of Kerri Chandler. Replete with flute, piano, and inspiring words from Ben Westbeech, it’s almost corny, but it works perfectly as the blissed-out climax. On the other hand, the itchy-feet percussion of Sir Lord Comixx’s “Soul House” sounds like it could have come out of London’s contemporary jazzy house scene, but actually dates back to 1996. Dijon’s research into these old records highlights how trends live, die, and loop back in new forms in dance music, a history that’s constantly in dialogue with itself. There are always records you haven’t heard, rare gems or secret weapons that reveal some new wrinkle in a genre’s story. Dijon is an expert at connecting these dots, joining eras and audiences at the same time. Who else could pair Art of Tones’ “Praise,” to me an awful late-’00s tech-house track (and one of just two sore thumbs on an otherwise stellar mix), with a Waajeed house jam, and make it sound so right? All of this musical history comes with a social history, too. Dijon has been a vocal proponent for reminding newer audiences where this music came from: Black and queer people like herself. You can hear this on the mix, with its string of excellent Black house music records dating from the ’90s until now, and you can read it in her interviews. But she’s also a realist who recognizes that things change—she’s not a scrappy underground DJ anymore, and she doesn’t need to be. Instead, she’s raising a big tent and wants everyone to feel welcome in it: “I want to be in a room with drug dealers and prostitutes and trans women and queer people and non-binary people and hedge fund people,” she said in a recent interview. While some fans will bristle at the idea of hedge fund managers in underground dance music, Honey Dijon’s career arc shows that none of this is really underground anymore. DJing is bigger than it’s ever been, and if that means artists like Honey Dijon are finally getting the dues they deserve, that doesn’t seem like a bad thing. Her DJ-Kicks feels like a triumphant calling card—something you’d play for a dance-music agnostic to convert them to the cause. Full of killer choruses, richly textured instrumentals, and empowering messages about struggle and redemption, it underlines the enduring themes of house music, whether we’re talking a Chicago nightclub in the ’70s or a glitzy Ibiza bar in 2024. It’s universal, and it has something for pretty much everyone to appreciate—and isn’t that the point of this whole thing to begin with?",0,"October 24, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/honey-dijon-dj-kicks-honey-dijon/
Wild Pink,Dulling the Horns,7.3,Rock,"There’s an easily understood message inside of “Eating the Egg Whole,” the second song on Wild Pink’s fifth album: “Sometimes a dream ain’t meant to be lived in, it’s meant to be forgotten.” Impermanence is a fact of life—holding onto something fleeting usually isn’t healthy. Pretty universal message. You might miss this kernel of wisdom, though, as frontman John Ross spends the rest of the song wrapping it in flashy sports metaphors. He lays out Michael Jordan’s late-career arc, from the 1997 offseason to his 2003 retirement, each bookend pegged to one specific detail (an iconic beret, “freedom fries”) and one sports franchise shakeup (the Washington Bullets becoming the Wizards, the Montreal Expos becoming the Washington Nationals). After a few listens, the connection to the “nothing’s forever” theme becomes clearer, but Ross’ choice of evidence remains uncharacteristically idiosyncratic. This is Wild Pink’s most driving, propulsive album, but I have no idea what it’s about. Within the first seconds of opener “The Fences of Stonehenge,” Ross finds a meaty, full-bodied guitar sound that he likes, and he barely tweaks a knob over the next 38 minutes. A Wild Pink album hasn’t had this level of consistency since 2018’s breakout Yolk in the Fur. 2022’s ILYSM was particularly eclectic, darting between knotty folk-rock, electro-pop, and doomgaze, held together by a unifying focus on Ross’ recent cancer diagnosis. Dulling the Horns is the exact opposite: straight down the middle, despite lyrics that shoot off in every direction. A few months before ILYSM, Ross debuted a heavier, distorted sound on the non-album single “Q. Degraw,” which bled into that album’s crushing “Sucking on the Birdshot.” J Mascis also guested on ILYSM; Dulling the Horns sounds a bit like the Dinosaur Jr. guitarist produced a Bruce Springsteen album. If you’ve been coming to Wild Pink for gentler, more emotionally open music, this album might initially scan as abrasive, but the way it contrasts with ILYSM’s aimless, saccharine moments provides a new lease on life. Ross splices loud riffage into the heartland rock that dominated Yolk in the Fur and 2021’s A Billion Little Lights, and at the tail end of the Lost in the Dream decade, it’s an injection of sorely needed excitement into an inherited sound. Sometimes the results are stately and sweeping, as on “Disintegrate,” which lets Ross’ swathes of fuzz serve as a backdrop for Adam Schatz’s saxophone leads. “The Fences of Stonehenge” might get by with only staccato acoustic strums, but Ross’ grimier electric tones add real strut, a kind of rock’n’roll swagger that’s never been a Wild Pink calling card. But Dulling the Horns is at its best when it’s piling on layers and stripping them away with little warning. “Cloud or Mountain” begins with a pristine wall of early-Weezer power-pop riffage, then pairs it with a glockenspiel that dusts the lead melody with Born to Run-style confectioner’s sugar. After a mid-song pivot, the guitars get countryfied and lo and behold, a pedal steel pops up. Ross’ frequently inscrutable lyrics contrast with the invitingly crunchy music. “Catholic Dracula,” ostensibly a song about Ross’ relationship with religion, features a line that belongs in a “Gnosticism for Kids” book: “Way before he ever was a bat/Dracula was a Catholic too, in fact.” Like “Eating the Egg Whole,” the rest of the song contains a few more obvious deeper truths, but once again, the method feels at odds with Ross’ oeuvre. Dulling the Horns is not a wild left turn, but it’s simultaneously weirder and more fun than anything in Wild Pink’s discography.

Wendy Eisenberg,Viewfinder,7.7,,"Throughout Viewfinder, the latest album by the prolific guitarist and collaborator Wendy Eisenberg, the sound of the room is often not just audible, but conspicuous. At the outset of “Set a Course,” the member of Editrix, Birthing Hips, and the Bill Orcutt Quartet sings a capella, their notes clear and plainspoken and long, and the softly hissing presence of the recording space becomes increasingly close. It may seem strange to remark on the subtlest part of an album that revolves around a 22-minute noise epic that constantly collapses in and out of sync. But the room tone feels like it’s there to be noticed. Viewfinder was inspired by the Maryland-raised, Brooklyn-based musician’s experience getting laser surgery to remedy a lifetime of eye problems. The disorienting experience of being able to see clearly for the first time sent them diving into the concept of sight, studying the work of John Berger, Jacqueline Rose, and the quack medic who blinded Handel and Bach. Eisenberg’s wide-ranging research prompted them to consider the subjectivity and potential oppressiveness of being defined by a single perspective. In the same way that a printed photograph makes the permanence of a split-second clear—how “a picture lives a lifetime out of time,” as Eisenberg states on “If an Artist”—foregrounding the materiality of the recording highlights the idea that these 79 improvisatory minutes were just 79 minutes among potentially many more; that although this is the recording of the ensemble’s work you are hearing, that doesn’t necessarily make it definitive. It’s indicative of the slipperiness of Viewfinder, which starts with “Lasik,” Eisenberg’s account of getting eye surgery. Above all, it’s a warning to themself—and by extension, any listener hoping for easy platitudes about life in hi-def—that “changing isn’t healing.” If anything, the six-minute track suggests the opposite: fraught and close, low horns lurking like flickering shadows, Eisenberg’s guitar locked into a minor half-siren motif, the drums skittish and dry and close; but then the guitar being stroked up and down the fretboard, the effect tender but disorientating, followed by tense static and grave violin sawing. The knotted construction of the song, and Eisenberg’s serious, earnest tone throughout, bring to mind Phil Elverum or British iconoclast Richard Dawson, and how both stake out their territory with the tension of deepening inquiry, stretching the limits of what is known. In the liner notes, Eisenberg concludes: “Since writing this music, I have begun to comfort myself with the notion that loving something does not require that what is beloved be understood.” Viewfinder is primarily instrumental, spanning free jazz, post-rock, flashes of beauty, and pockets of mournfulness. Its textures are wild and tangled, with repeating harmonic patches that quickly slip away. There is the temptation with any instrumental music to overlay a narrative—and not least when a record like this dangles such easy metaphors as clarity, obscurity, and resistance. So the lightest way to frame these digressions might be as reflections of the joy of discovery, of allowing things to change and marveling as they do. “Two Times Water” has picaresque woodwinds, puckish piano, billowing horns, then a moment where every element of the instrumentation seems to try and make a break for it; “HM” is harsher, everything playing at cross purposes while that siren guitar motif returns. “Afterimage” is the 22-minute centerpiece, beginning with cool, walking bass and lightly fizzing cymbals dragged down by a heavy anchor of piano and horns. It’s variously arid, booming, busy, and empty; at one point, the drums vibrate so finely they sound like hummingbird wings. It rarely settles and can feel like being tossed around in stormy waters that pay no heed to the tides. Though the band’s furrowed interplay is hugely impressive, it’s a challenging piece to absorb in one go; perhaps it would be more gripping beheld live. Aside from the sheer invention, what’s most striking about Viewfinder is Eisenberg’s ability to crystallize their complex, nuanced thoughts about the limits of perception without creating new dogma in the process. The fear of being whittled down to a clear image, even in the mirror, fuels “Set a Course,” where they aim to go “past what I’m told is abstraction/Find no other world that can touch me.” The dry, increasingly staticky “If an Artist” implies that anyone who aspires to the title must run beyond the picture’s frame, eluding capture, and Eisenberg sings in a high, uncertain tone as the quiet resounds. The gnarled and broken loops of the title track echo the punishingly unproductive spiral of poor self-image, the thoughts “satisfied with poisoning my mind.” Viewfinder closes with an excellent, lonely rewrite of the folk song “In the Pines” that’s chilling both for the spooked lounge instrumentation and Eisenberg’s observation that the bliss of the unobserved is always short-lived, the violence of being reduced and taxonomized all but inevitable. Once again, they make the case for elusiveness feel like a clear statement: testament to Eisenberg’s unique vision. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Nilüfer Yanya,My Method Actor,8.5,Pop/R&B,"The way Nilüfer Yanya plays the guitar, with a hollow picking, it’s like she’s scratching an incessant itch. It’s an intimate feeling to be let in on as a listener, but it’s also given her songs an occasional harried edge. The British indie musician’s first album, 2019’s Miss Universe, was raucous and bold, but when she sang of “lying in a pool of someone else’s blood,” you didn’t get the feeling she was exactly relaxed. Her second album, 2022’s PAINLESS (a misdirection of a title if I ever heard one), throbbed with Yanya’s honeyed vocals wrapped around her serpentine guitar melodies. The music was tantalizing but it was anxious, sometimes showy. Not a bad thing, but it felt self-conscious, like she had something to prove. On her third and best album, My Method Actor, she’s matured, found herself, chilled out—whatever you want to call it, it’s made her music more triumphant, less nervous. It’s an album that has the feel of everyday luxury, a collection of songs so assured that they feel like they always existed, and Yanya simply plucked them out of the air to give to you. She’s not without her problems (the thorniness of romance is a lyrical theme), but instead of shredding out her frustrations out with a gnarly riff or a honking saxophone solo, she owns them poetically, giving a torch singer’s graceful performance across the album’s 11 songs. Yanya’s signature guitar sound is still present, but the itch has been scratched. Some of that newfound ease may be thanks to songwriter Wilma Archer, once an electronic music producer known as Slime who co-wrote My Method Actor with Yanya. This is the first album where Yanya has worked with only one producer, and having a steady collaborator gives the album a cohesion you may not have noticed the previous two didn’t have. The sound is unhurried and lush, with Yanya’s voice confidently tender. “I’m a loser first/Come on do your worst,” she taunts on album opener “Keep On Dancing,” in a line that might recall a classic retort from Girls’ Hannah Horvath: “Any mean thing someone’s gonna think of to say about me, I’ve already said to me, about me.” Except (no spoilers) I don’t think Hannah actualized the lesson from that kind of self-critique in the way Yanya has. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. In fact, “Keep On Dancing” begins with a moment of vinegar, a gauntlet thrown. “What you looking for?/Shut up and raise your glass if you’re not sure/Still I can smile, it’s fucking miserable/So deep in the crime of being beautiful.” She says “shut up” in a way that drips with bile, and delivers the rest of the lines unapologetically. Whoever she is talking to deserves it. But this is not a mean or spiteful album. It’s an album about getting comfortable in the discomfort. On the single “Like I Say (I runaway),” Yanya sings, “The minute I’m not in control/I’m tearing up inside.” It’s a line that would make a therapist simultaneously concerned yet proud of her self-awareness. In the music video, Yanya plays a runaway bride, an image perhaps a little too on the nose. But when she loses her veil and escapes, it’s not into someone else’s arms, The Graduate-style, but into an empty field. She looks around at the trees, the sky. Nothing offers her an idea of her next move. She didn’t bail because she had a better thing going, she just knew that what was in front of her wasn’t right, and so she did something about it. This bounding into the unknown is expressed throughout the album with light accent pieces, notably Joe Harvey-Whyte’s plaintively played pedal-steel guitar, which shows up on four tracks, and Clíona Ní Choileáin’s august cello performance, which shows up on two. Neither instrument is over- or underutilized, and neither overwhelms the songs with anything florid. When Choileáin’s instrument enters towards the end of “Mutations,” a song with a bit of an angsty constitution, it just feels like relief. One of my favorite songs on My Method Actor is “Binding,” which may be the record’s quietest. It’s exemplary of the album’s easy strength; her voice exudes confidence. It’s a Sade-style miracle Yanya’s singing pumps out such force while hardly ever needing to rise above a whisper. Matching her vocal performance, “Binding” boils the instrumentation down to the bare bones, but nothing is lost. The song is made of not much more than a spare drum line, pedal steel, and folky strum of the guitar, while Yanya sings an impressionistic tale that is either about a car accident, getting high, or the end of a relationship. Maybe all three? She isn’t sure. In a recent interview, Yanya said of the song, “I can’t be too certain, but all the lyrics leading up to that are about someone being totally out of it, like they’ve drunk too much, or they’re on this long drive and are not really present.” She says the song’s subject is “trying to escape and get to this blissful nowhereness, of leaving their body behind.” That sounds good, until you realize maybe it doesn’t. It’s nice to regard the soul, but on this journey to nirvana, does our earthly body not deserve some respect? Apparently not. On “Made Out of Memory,” Yanya, wispy and staccato, directly addresses this corporeal egress with some of the album’s most threatening lyrics, knife to her own throat: “I’ll dig my own grave/I don’t give a fuck.” Another venomous moment. But one done with admirable self-acceptance, however troubled. The next line: “You know I’m not ashamed to jump in.” You have to believe her.

Cassandra Jenkins,"My Light, My Destroyer",8.0,Rock,"In March 2022, Cassandra Jenkins was laid up with COVID at a Homewood Suites in Aurora, Illinois, drowning her sorrows in Wayne’s World while her tour bus drove on without her. It was a terrible time to get sick. Not long before, the lifelong musician had been ready to give up music altogether—or at least jettison hopes of ever making a real career of it—when her second album, 2021’s An Overview on Phenomenal Nature, unexpectedly connected with fans and critics. Now, quarantined in her hotel room, her mind spinning with worst-case scenarios, she began writing a song to keep anxiety at bay. “You know I’m gonna keep at this thing if it kills me/And it kills me,” she sang, in an early version of what would eventually become “Aurora, IL,” one of the standouts from her new album, My Light, My Destroyer. Determination and its flip side, desperation, are nothing new in Jenkins’ work. (“Give yourself a few years… None of them like you, dear,” she sang wryly on her solo debut, Play Till You Win.) But here, they take on almost cosmic dimensions, providing the backdrop to some of her most revelatory—and carefully rendered—songwriting yet. “Desperation,” in fact, is the sixth word we hear on the whole record, in an opening line in which Jenkins tells us, in no uncertain terms, just how desperate she is. She recounts an existential search, nonspecific yet unmistakably real. As she reaches a climax in her quest, she sings, “And I felt my arms rise light as feathers,” her alto warmly reassuring over a sweet approximation of Van Dyke Parks-esque ’60s pop. But everything gossamer suddenly turns hard and brittle: “And the clock hit me like a hammer/And my eyes rolled back like porcelain/And the breeze cooled me like aspirin/And I cried.” You can practically feel each one of the objects she invokes beneath your fingertips. The album is peppered with similarly dazzling images and unexpected counterpoints. In the slippery heartland rock of “Aurora, IL,” her sickbed spell leads her gaze upward, to planes crisscrossing the sky, and then even higher, to a vision of William Shatner circling the planet, weightless in one of Jeff Bezos’ rockets. Shatner weeps upon re-entry. Juxtaposed against this, she spins humdrum worry (“How long can I stare at the ceiling/Before it kills me?” goes the line in the final version) into a meditation on the precarity of the human condition. She’s also just plain funny. Jenkins has always had a sneaky sense of humor—look no further than her fondness for unexplained Easter eggs. (After her debut album ended with “Halley,” a song about the comet, she slipped “Hailey,” a tribute to her friend Hailey Benton Gates, the actor/journalist/model, into the penultimate slot on An Overview on Phenomenal Nature; the new album closes with a lilting instrumental outro called “Hayley.”) On “Clams Casino,” a smoldering rave-up about loneliness inspired by her grandmother’s death, she contemplates leaving the hotel bar and driving out to the ocean, leading to an unexpected punchline. “I heard someone order the Clams Casino,” she sings. “I said, ‘Hey, what’s that?’ They said, ‘I dunno.’” It’s a joke so anticlimactic, you can almost imagine Stephen Wright intoning it in his trademark deadpan. Yet there’s tenderness here, too—the empathy of someone who knows what it feels like to be let down in a moment of need. Once loosely rooted in Americana-tinged indie, Jenkins stretched herself on An Overview on Phenomenal Nature, experimenting with ambient jazz. Here, she pushes further into a switchbacking sequence of interstitial instrumentals and collaged field recordings. Some of these feel central to her themes: “Betelgeuse” captures a moment in which Jenkins and her mother, a science teacher, go star-gazing, pointing out Orion and the Moon. Her mother’s enthusiasm is infectious, and the feeling of looking up at the vastness of space, awed by the sprawl of all of those tiny pinpricks of light, will be familiar to anyone who has ever rolled out a sleeping bag in their suburban backyard. The collages don’t always work; “Attente Téléphonique,” a meandering spoken-word fragment in French, breaks up the flow of the album’s final third. But it’s nonetheless gratifying to hear Jenkins loosening up and pushing beyond the signposts she’s previously established for her sound—no more so than in “Petco,” a song about loneliness and regret (like so many on this album!) set to molten guitar tones that summon ’90s alt-rock and, particularly, the clean-lined pop-grunge of the Breeders. It’s an audacious shift in tone, but, thanks in part to her collaborators, it works beautifully. If only all grunge pastiches felt so natural and so fun. Like “The Ramble,” her previous album’s closing song, “Only One” highlights Jenkins’ facility for understated sophistipop; she’s a masterfully silky interpreter of hurt, a canny channeler of failed love in the softest possible tones. But the album’s very best song is its most atypical. “Delphinium Blue” is mostly synths—per the credits, a dream lineup of Korg Poly 800, Yamaha CS15, Roland JX-03, Roland Alpha Juno, and more, plus a little fretless bass, from Spencer Zahn, to keep the whole thing well-oiled. It’s an unusually distilled sound, as though all of those keyboards had been fed, via a slow drip, into a clear liquid in a clear tube. Jenkins’ writing is equally concentrated. “I saw I missed your call/Sorry for not picking up/I got the job/At the flower shop,” she sings in the song’s first four lines. But if desperation—which is nothing but a particularly unruly form of desire—is the backdrop of the album, here she keeps that want coolly in check. Drop by drop, she fills in just enough details to complete the picture of her determined protagonist, who intones motivational mantras to herself in a soft, meditative purr: “Chin up/Stay on task/Wash the windows/Count the cash.” Jenkins has never wielded a more finely tipped pen than when she offers us the image of night falling “like thorns/Off the roses,” or her protagonist methodically snipping stems, keeping cool in the walk-in. Over a backdrop that sounds like Enya scoring a David Lynch film, Jenkins paints an exquisitely detailed picture of desire and control. Scissors in hand, eyes fixed on the fogged glass, she keeps the tumult of unchecked emotion at bay. Correction: A previous version of this review misstated the proprietor of the space rocket.

Loidis,One Day,7.9,Electronic,"Six years ago, Brian Leeds—better known as the ambient-techno producer Huerco S.—invented a new alias, Loidis, for a one-off release. A Parade, in the Place I Sit, the Floating World (& All Its Pleasures) shared certain key characteristics with Huerco S. records. It was suggestively murky, dusted with dull glitter, propelled by four-on-the-floor beats that were more implicit than explicit. One track was 10 minutes long; another ran to more than a quarter of an hour, burbling away like an enchanted brook. It seemed to say, Dance or drift off—it’s all the same to me. The music’s dubby pulse and foggy sound design nodded to a particular set of Y2K-era influences—Basic Channel and their Chain Reaction kin, Jan Jelinek, Vladislav Delay—that were canonical though not, in 2018, particularly fashionable. In the intervening years, those sounds have crept back around, rediscovered by a generation that wasn’t there for the first wave. Artists like Purelink, J. Albert, and James Devane have all been toying with styles associated with the German minimal techno of the early 2000s. Many of these artists, following Huerco S.’s lead, seem inspired primarily by atmospheric qualities. But on Loidis’ new album, One Day, the Kansas City producer dials up the intensity. Leeds’ first full-length under the alias aims straight for the dancefloor with a collection of trippy, springy tracks that seem designed, like a candy-flipping Energizer Bunny, to thump away until long past sunup. A Parade, in the Place I Sit, the Floating World (& All Its Pleasures) was largely an ambient affair, but One Day’s opening track, “Tell Me,” arrives like a shot across the bow. Its quick-stepping kicks and hi-hats seem designed to match the energetic tempos of 2024’s notoriously demanding dancefloors. The hiccupping bassline pushes against the beat, like a sprinter trying to break out of the pack. In “Wait & See,” which follows, clicky hi-hats rush forward just as impatiently, tripping over their own feet in a headlong dash. “Tequa” is slower and more buoyant, in keeping with the lazy dub techno of 2018’s “A Parade,” but its forceful kick and plunging chord stabs telegraph a determination to dig in for the long haul. Track after track feels like a study in groove science—a little nudge here, a little drag there, and presto: a perpetual motion machine. Once you sink into the music, you start to notice strange things happening in the pockets around those elastic grooves. Little wisps of tone flicker and are extinguished, regular as clockwork. Whisper-soft percussive sounds duck their heads out from behind other, equally evasive sounds, like bashful voyeurs. The central feature of “Love’s Lineaments” is a set of dubbed-out chords that feel like hesitant answers to the up-for-it bassline. With every repetition, they slide a little bit further behind the beat, notes smearing across the stave. You could get lost in a detail like that, following them as they glide, trying to parse their tangled frequencies. Tracking their motions feels like cloudspotting, or trying to fix one’s gaze on a strange bit of flotsam coming around the river’s bend. Repetition is Leeds’ trustiest tool. Many of these tracks are little more than a handful of looped phrases spun ad infinitum. But he keeps his hands on the controls at all times, dubbing and filtering and tweaking. The marginal becomes the main event: In “Sugar Snot,” the album’s propulsive highlight, you might come for the gravelly bassline, but it’s the wiggly little drum fills that hold your attention, distracting you from the fact that the track is essentially a one-bar loop stretched out for nearly nine minutes. In “Dollarama,” he works subtractively, using filters to muffle and veil. The song’s glancing dub chords are dead ringers for Basic Channel and their ilk, but I don’t think it’s just a retro thing: In its linear sweep and refusal of the obvious, One Day is a proposal for a different kind of dancing and DJing. It’s the opposite of the jagged, percussive, electricity-zapped, resolutely digital styles of club music that have been in vogue for the past decade, and it’s just as far removed from the giddily pop- and trance-fueled techno that conquered clubs and festivals post-pandemic. The album is too understated to read as a polemic. But One Day is nevertheless a reminder that there’s room for subtlety, drifting, and doubt in dance music. Sometimes, the heart of the music lies in what you only think you hear. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Verraco,,8.2,Electronic,"Verraco and his peers in Medellín, Colombia once presented themselves as rave revolutionaries: guerillas rising up to topple a hegemonic club culture and wrest electronic music from the Global North’s death grip. They called their label Insurgentes; its inaugural release, Verraco’s debut EP, was titled Resistir. But over the past seven years, Verraco (aka JP López) and his crew have grown from upstarts into some of the most feted names in the underground, kingpins of a scene that onlookers have dubbed—somewhat problematically—“Latin club.” Yet Verraco has never been one to be pigeonholed. True, he deployed cumbia rhythms on the 2020 song “Breaking Hegemonies” and sampled the iconic Zapatista spokesman Subcomandante Marcos on “Hasta morir si es preciso.” Releases on his label TraTraTrax, a successor to Insurgentes, are awash in Caribbean dembow, Venezuelan raptor house, Mexican tribal techno, and other sounds from across Latin America and the diaspora. But TraTraTrax refuses to be pinned to any identity but the one that the community has invented for itself: The label described 2022’s no pare, sigue sigue—the closest thing the scene has had to a manifesto—as a “popurrí,” a mixture of “everything and nothing, just sudaca bangers loaded with flavour and resentment, but above all, resentment, because we don’t want our wounds to heal.” Verraco’s music is equally informed by the brain-bending sounds of Aphex Twin, Autechre, and other UK electronic pioneers, along with the psychedelia of artists like James Holden and the darkside electro of Rotterdam and The Hague. This is also a kind of resistance, a way of reminding worldwide audiences that López has as much claim to the Euro-American techno canon as any white kid in Ohio or Heidelberg. After the relative abstraction of his 2020 album Grial, Verraco dropped his heaviest, most triumphantly unbridled work yet with last year’s storming and altogether unorthodox Escándaloo, a double-barreled shot across club music’s bow; now, on Breathe… Godspeed, he breaks out even bigger guns. The four tracks bear some relationship to other contemporary Latin club anthems in their chugging rhythms and severe sonics, but in their sheer, intransigent weirdness, they sound little like anything else—from anywhere at all. Rather than any given style, Verraco’s work is defined by its intensity—overdriven synths, distorted percussion, violently gyrating oscillators—and the epic scale of his arrangements, which often sound less like club tracks than galactic battle-march hymns. Both qualities are in ample supply on these four tracks, which feel like a single overarching suite. They share a palette of muscular drums, digitally abraded textures, and wildly disorienting sound design. Nothing is what it seems: Basslines growl like cyborg beasts, while processed voices—jabbering and chattering indecipherably—might be mischievous aliens. The mood is exhilarating but unsettling; both the intricate patterning and ambiguous air of malice remind me of the geometric landscapes and “machine elves” described by many DMT users. Verraco’s tracks report from an alternate dimension of club music, where even the most familiar trope is made thrillingly strange. Breathe… Godspeed’s four tracks also share a resistance to doing anything you might expect them to do. On the opening “0∞,” Verraco withholds the bass for more than two minutes, stoking tension with a succession of high, squealy frequencies; then, halfway through, a plunging breakdown suggests shades of garish 2011 dubstep crossed with the harsh, fuck-off sonics of underground noise music. Only toward the end does a 4/4 beat claw the track back from the edge of chaos. “Godspeed >” turns the same elements into a relentless percussive assault; “Climaxing | Breathe” drops the tempo to a grueling 85 BPM, dials up the dissonance, and wraps around an ascending glissando that sounds like a Shepard-Risset tone from hell. Just when you expect the beat to drop, the whole track just fizzles out. It’s an audacious way to thwart an anticipated climax; you can practically hear Verraco cackling to himself in the studio. Nowhere is Verraco more unpredictable than on the closing track, “Sí, idealízame.” It’s the EP’s emotional heart, fueled by a surprisingly melodic bass progression and festooned with gleaming accents. Like “Climaxing | Breathe,” it moves with a feeling of perpetual ascent; every time you expect the beat to kick in full-force, one or more elements pull back, withholding the satisfaction of the drop. The groove moves so swiftly and forcefully that it might take a while to realize that there are almost no drums, just an understated kick and hi-hats dissolved into a fine mist. But there are no snares, no congas, no cowbells—none of the stereotypical attributes of Latin club. The title translates as something like “yes, idealize me,” or “sure, fetishize me.” I read it as a provocation: Try to put Verraco in a box if you like—he’s got other plans.",1,"June 11, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/verraco-breathe-godspeed-ep/
Abida Parveen,Raqs-e-Bismil,9.3,Folk/Country,"You’d think that one of the greatest vocalists of all time might have some notes for rising musicians. But as a judge on the 2012 reality singing competition Sur Kshetra, famed Pakistani Sufi singer Abida Parveen was often exceedingly neutral. When asked in an interview why she avoids sharing criticism despite being appointed as a judge, she responded with her typical wisdom: “Because it’s music, not war.” The journalist interviewing her followed up, asking who she hoped would win the competition. “I pray Allah makes a good decision. That’s all.” Parveen’s humility and diplomacy are almost comical given her position as one of the most famous and influential musicians in South Asian history. When she was 5, her father chose her over her brothers to become his successor in their family practice of Sufi singing, and by the age of 23, she was named the official singer of Radio Pakistan, the national public broadcaster for radio in the country. Now 70 years old, Parveen, who is often referred to as “the queen of Sufi music,” has released over a hundred albums, received the Nishan-e-Imtiaz—Pakistan’s highest civilian award—and is credited with helping popularize Sufi music and culture among young people in South Asia and around the world. Parveen’s modesty despite her immense success is part of her religion. She makes music in the tradition of Sufism, a mystical, philosophical expression of Islam that began in the 10th century. Sufism prioritizes spiritual purification, a divine, intoxicating connection with God, and a sense of humility that comes from prioritizing that connection above all earthly desires. In interviews, Parveen often deemphasizes her importance as a person, instead positioning her performances as a means for communing with God. “The truth doesn’t need to be told,” she said in an interview in 2001. “It can only be experienced. Remember, I’m not performing. He is singing through me. It is His song, and it sings by itself.” Sufism also specifically deprioritizes the role of the singer in music-making. The Sufi practice of sama’—listening to music with the intention of achieving closeness to God—instead privileges the listener. The concept of sama’ has inspired artistic movements across the globe from Turkey’s whirling dervishes to Morocco’s Gnaoua music, which has had an outsized influence on jazz greats in the West like Ornette Coleman and Pharoah Sanders, to name just a couple. On stage, when Parveen channels the greatness of God, she transforms completely. She sometimes hallucinates while on stage, or brings the audience to tears by singing just a few notes. Nowhere is her singular vocal talent clearer than on her excellent 2000 album Raqs-e-Bismil. The album title translates to “Dance of the Wounded,” and on the record, Parveen conveys burning desire and yearning for God through the subtleties of her singing: the poise with which she delivers a single note, the husky, smoldering tone of her voice, her interplay between precision and fervor. She’s often compared to Nina Simone, whose shows have been described as “having the aura of sacramental rites.” The two artists sing with such dynamism and heart that when you listen to them, you feel transported beyond the limitations of your body and individual perceptions and into a spiritual realm of infinite possibility. Even though Parveen is such a prolific artist, Raqs-e-Bismil remains one of her most critically acclaimed and impactful albums because of the beauty of the lyrics and how eloquently she delivers them. She also refers to it as her fusion album, undoubtedly among her most sonically adventurous. The arrangements are sparse—often just tabla, strings, and synth—but cohesive, inky, and foreboding. It’s an album fraught with tension: between the earthly and the divine, the beauty of her voice and the devastation of her words, the stylized Urdu and the more colloquial folk language she oscillates between, and the foundations in South Asian classical music and Western influences. At the time of its release, international audiences were primed to hear it. Western listeners had become increasingly familiar with South Asian Sufi music over the latter half of the 19th century. Qawwali, the most well-known form of Sufi music from South Asia, had been practiced since the 13th century, but started to be used in Indian film music beginning in the 1940s. In 1975, The Sabri Brothers played at Carnegie Hall, the first qawwali musicians to perform in the United States. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan went on to experiment with the form and collaborate with a number of Western artists including Peter Gabriel, Eddie Vedder, and Michael Brook. His and Brook’s collaborative album, Night Song, was nominated for a Grammy for Best World Music Album in 1997. When Khan died in 1997, Abida Parveen was seen as his successor, especially in Western media. But as an assessment on Parveen’s talent, defining her as a successor to Khan felt inadequate. She was more his peer than his pupil—she had been singing for four decades when he died— not to mention the two artists also have entirely different musical approaches. Khan’s famous qawwali performances engross the listener in a cacophony of sound. The music generally begins with slow, rhythmic instrumental interludes and meditative vocals, but the performers use hand claps and lively calls and responses between the lead singer and a backing chorus to build to a frenetic climax over the course of 10 to 30 minutes. Parveen specializes in kafi, a sparser, more repetitive form of South Asian music that features only one singer and pulls from regional folk traditions in Sindh and Punjab. Qawwali creates a sense of orchestral grandeur, while kafi focuses on the effect and emotion of the individual singer. It’s the difference between walking through a garden in full bloom and observing the singular beauty of a wildflower. On Raqs-e-Bismil, she sings kafi as well as ghazal, a third form of South Asian poetry defined by rhyming couplets and highly stylized Urdu language. All forms of Sufi music aspire to remind the listener of the ecstasy of communing with God, but ghazal and kafi do so by emphasizing lyricism and introspection over the fervor incited in qawwali. Raqs-e-Bismil pushes the solitary, contemplative mood to almost unbearably heart-wrenching levels. On Parveen’s album Janaan, released the same year, a bright bamboo flute trill or cascading synth blip sprinkle the mix with whimsy and color. On Raqs-e-Bismil, the arrangements are far more meditative and entrancing. Even compared to other releases like 1997’s Humsafar or 2000’s Ho Jamalo, where the instrumentation is pared back, Raqs-e-Bismil sounds much more lush, cohesive, and immersive. The boisterous spontaneity of those other arrangements is replaced with poised, expansive synth and tabla notes that fill the room like fog. For the arrangements and lyrical selections on Raqs-e-Bismil, Parveen worked with composer and filmmaker Muzaffar Ali, a collaborator who was just as committed to Sufi mysticism as she was. While working on these compositions, Ali traveled to India’s northern mountainous region and let the natural beauty there inspire him. In his autobiography, he speaks emphatically about this period in his life, and the arrangements that came from it. “I saw in the mountains around me, in the magnificent trees that embraced these mountains, emitting a fragrance as the rains lashed to loosen their embrace,” he wrote. “The mythology became poetry, and poetry became rhythm, and the rhythm, a melody. Each ghazal I chose and composed gripped the soul…They came alive in the monsoon mist rising from the Naini Lake...Poetry is a bridge that helps you cross oceans and mountains. I was doing that in Raqs-e-Bismil.” While driving from the mountains of India down to the capital of New Delhi, he got into a car accident maiming his thumb so badly he had to have skin grafted from his thigh to fix the injury. This experience, he says, is how “pain entered the ghazals of Raqs-e-Bismil.” It’s an incredibly dramatic account of his life and creative process, but there would be no Raqs-e-Bismil without that kind of emotion. There’s a profound vulnerability to this music because the audience hears Parveen in the middle of her quest. Her devotional practice is ongoing, incomplete, and constantly transforming, and yet she invites us to bear witness to her attempt. As much as she sees herself as a vessel for God, she inevitably evokes the sublime through the prism of the earthly. There will always be the performer, the microphone, the ego, the fallibility that contrasts with the pristine ideal she evokes. And when you as the listener experience the ecstasy that she describes, you have to hold it next to the other realities of your own life: the buzz of your air conditioner, the grocery list you’ve started making in your head, the itch of a mosquito bite. These oppositional experiences don’t deter from one another but rather make both feel more accessible, more intertwined, and more understandable. Parveen takes many paths towards holiness. There are songs of denial and songs of joy on Raqs-e-Bismil. On “Zahid Ne,” she sings, “The preacher has not yet seen the essence of my faith/He has not witnessed the tresses that hide the beauty of your face.” She briefly enters a frenzied state of unity with God, then defines God as everything that is inaccessible to her. There are fleeting moments of fluorescent ecstasy too, especially in the two kafi songs on the album: “Roshan Jamaal-e-Yaar” revels in a lover’s charm and captivating gaze, comparing it to divine beauty. And though “Ji Chahe” speaks of self-destruction—of losing your sense of self like a moth burning up in a flame—the understanding is that this transformation would be a welcome spell of euphoria. The writing on many of the ghazals is elliptical, attempting to write around the concept of God, or to define him in terms of what he isn’t. On opener “Yaar Ko Hamne Ja Baja Dekha,” Parveen describes her lover as a series of opposites: sometimes he is hidden, sometimes he is apparent. Sometimes he is a king descending from the throne, other times a poor man carrying his water. Indirect writing often only vaguely gestures at emotion, but on Raqs-e-Bismil, the slipperiness and opacity of Parveen’s interactions with God contrasts with her deep desire for closeness. She is constantly searching, lamenting, and struggling to grasp onto a sense of unity that she knows is achievable but can’t always experience. In Parveen’s voice, these heady lyrics move from the realm of the intellect to the heart. The emotional range she shows on “Zahid Ne” alone is astounding: She repeats the same melody over and over but changes her delivery every time she returns to a phrase. She is alternately patient, nostalgic, all-knowing, and desperate. The reverb on her voice adds a sense of resonant fullness and poignancy that is buoyed by a gentle tabla beat that progresses steadily and patiently, like the footsteps of a hiker who has found their rhythm halfway through their ascent. Listening to words bloom from Parveen’s voice, I’m reminded of the concept of sonder: the realization that every person you pass on the street has as full a life as your own. Similarly, each word Parveen sings evokes entire universes. Within the span of a single word, it’s easy to imagine the spark of first love, or birth and death of a cosmos. Parveen generally takes an anti-identitarian stance. She is one of very few professionally singing Sufi women, but she sees herself less as an icon or a source of inspiration than a vessel through which God’s words can be heard. And yet, some of the 21st century’s most innovative artists find inspiration in her work. Pakistani American musician Arooj Aftab reverently cites an encounter with her and Björk lists her as one of her favorite musicians, having recently played her music at a DJ set in Brooklyn. Trans artist Lyra Pramuk relates to her quote about how Parveen feels when she performs: “I’m not a man or a woman, I’m a vehicle for passion.” Perhaps what these experimental musicians admire about Parveen is less her acclaim or any particular skill she has as a singer, but rather the patience and tenacity she exhibits in her pursuit of transcendence. Going for something greater than yourself is a motivation to keep honing your craft, refining your spiritual practice, tempering your ego. It is the most human desire. In art-making and spiritual practice, perfection is impossible: It’s the act of reaching that is so inspiring.",0,"July 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/abida-parveen-raqs-e-bismil/
Being Dead,EELS,8.3,Rock,"Being Dead begin their second album, EELS, with “Godzilla Rises,” a love song to Godzilla. This track, like much of the Austin duo’s topsy-turvy take on rock’n’roll, is absurd, humorous, and touching. The band practically swoons for the King of the Monsters, recasting the protuberances on the creature’s spine as “handles” for holding, a statement that would seem silly if it weren’t delivered with so much longing. The names of Being Dead’s two members, Falcon Bitch and Shmoofy (formerly Gumball) are an apt sign of their abject goofiness. Yet no matter how often Being Dead aim for the funny bones, their phenomenally fun music strikes the heart. EELS is relentless, hooky, and thematically looser than the band’s full-length debut, 2023’s When Horses Would Run, which reveled in the mythos of the American West. This is music of fine details and huge sentiments, in which a three-minute ditty called “Blanket of My Bone” feels like being emotionally leveled by your first real crush. Being Dead strike a delicate balance of mostly indelicate reference points: egg punk, cowboy kitsch, surf rock. Both band members sing, and either can take the low or high parts on these scrappy but precise arrangements—their voices call and respond, assert individuality, and come together in unison. Their interplay is self-consciously, nostalgically gendered: “I’m not Prince Charming in Rapunzel’s world,” Shmoofy declares on strangely moving highlight “Dragons II,” and later quips: “There’s no perch for your hair/And if there was, I’d just be pulling.” The album’s friction evokes a bevy of rock acts who harnessed male-female vocal tension: early ’90s indie underdogs Unrest, who counterbalanced scuzzy distortion and honeyed harmonies; or L.A. punk legends X, with their skin-tight rhythm section and the barreling back-and-forth of John Doe and Exene Cervenka; or the nanosecond when Pixies became a heartland pop act on “Here Comes Your Man.” Being Dead blow up their influences’ singing dynamics to fill 40 minutes, treating dueling vocals as a lead instrument in its own right. The band may have toned down the western pastiche since When Horses Would Run, but the regional fascination remains. “Country boys and country girls/Dancing under the Lonestar stars,” they croon on “Big Bovine,” and again on “Ballerina,” a potent, almost jingoistic image complicated by the ambiguity of oxymoron. Being Dead’s perspective smacks of Richard Prince’s iconic appropriated images of the Marlboro Man in the way the band reframes the raw material of Americana slightly yet powerfully, turning moments of would-be grace into satire, while imbuing tiny details with the weight of a big desert sky—or a lovesick teenager. EELS explores an ironic, campy sense of innocence, presenting young, unsure characters on the cusp of realizing the difficulties of adulthood. The narrator of “Problems” channels the wide-eyed, emotionally unschooled Talking Heads from their early CBGB years: “How can I fix the problem when it is with myself?” Throughout, Being Dead pack in tales of fruitless 9-to-5s, post-party sadness, and navigating feelings during a hookup, relating such ostensibly realistic stories with a wink that adds a welcome edge to their fervent performances. They have irresistible charm and a Pavement-level knack for speaking out of both sides of the mouth. Though the music appears bare-bones, it overflows with expertly sculpted feedback and unexpected instrumental cameos—Mellotron, banjo, Casio drums. Falcon Bitch and Shmoofy play nearly all the instruments, with touring bassist Nicole Roman-Johnston contributing backing vocals and occasional songwriting. Credit is due, too, to producer John Congleton, a studio zelig whose bountiful production catalog includes St. Vincent, Mannequin Pussy, and fellow Austinites Explosions in the Sky. The disc’s details are pitch perfect—bits of space-age sound dissolve into a locked-in rhythm on “Van Goes,” while jarring noises that sound ripped from an old arcade game introduce “Rock n’ Roll Hurts,” a climactic tune that bullseyes the record’s ever-moving target. Motion itself might be the point of EELS: from infatuation to fantasy and back again. Yet it’s the small, infectious flourishes that keep the record speeding along, whether the muted, off-beat fill that sparks “Love Machine” or the chorus of sighs on “Nightvision.” Being Dead gussy up their plentiful hooks in an array of guises—more than two friends playing dress-up at home, this music feels like a veritable pageant of production. But if it’s Godzilla that really gets the band’s heart pumping, perhaps it’s because the character first appeared in 1954, just as rock’n’roll itself was beginning to smash its way into modern life. EELS sets us in a recognizably vintage yet constantly changing temporality. There’s no internet on this album—instead, on “Love Machine,” we hear of technology that’s programmed to be a “heartthrob,” a conceit of countless sci-fi films and television shows from decades ago. Being Dead is hardly the first rock outfit to create their own little Earth by cherry-picking fantastical and historical aesthetics, but they do so with a verve and sense of humor that’s native to the 21st century—more particularly, to being young in an era when having hope for the future feels as distant as The Jetsons. Their music has such a palpable sense of yearning because yearning is a necessary ingredient in American dreams, because only fantasy can complete woefully inadequate realities. With an unerring ear for the romance and frivolity lacking in the present, Falcon Bitch and Shmoofy remake the future in the image of the past.

Garbage,Version 2.0,9.0,Rock,"Garbage was fake. In the mid-1990s, when a rock band was meant to wear Chuck Taylors and ripped jeans, publicly fret over the power gap between itself and the audience, and above all insist that the best thing art could do was remind everyone of the worst things about being alive—when all of this was called authenticity, and its performance was prized more than the performance of a monster riff—they were flagrantly inauthentic. They wrote big, garish alt-rock songs with choruses that mocked what they saw as alt-rock’s garishly romanticized depression. Their albums sounded like they cost a million dollars to make; their videos did cost a million dollars to make. Where other artists confessed or pleaded, Garbage teased, wrapping the radio up in a pink feather boa and blowing their listeners a kiss. And somehow, strangely, they were old, at least in pop-music terms: Singer Shirley Manson, the youngest, the one whose stage manner would soon have male rock critics bug-eyed and howling awooga, was nearly 30 when the band released their first album in 1995. Age was Garbage’s greatest asset, and it was the secret to their artistic success. It freed them from the pressures of having to play the tedious cred games that had been embroiling alt-rock since the first jock caught a whiff of Teen Spirit. Manson was already a 10-year veteran of the Scottish indie rock scene, and had been spotted by the rest of Garbage—first guitarist Steve Marker, who then told drummer Butch Vig, and guitarist Duke Erikson—when MTV played her band Angelfish’s video for the first and only time. Vig, on the cusp of 40 himself, was arguably the most important music producer in the world, fresh off a run of records so epochal their titles can still be recognized without reference to the artists who made them: Gish, Nevermind, Bricks Are Heavy, Dirty, Siamese Dream. Having arguably done more than anyone else to bring the DIY ethics of the early ’90s indie scene to people around the world, he washed his hands of the entire thing and set about the business of manufacturing music of his own. With Erikson and Marker, the latter his partner at Madison, Wisconsin’s Smart Studios, Vig was being commissioned for remixes by bands like Nine Inch Nails and U2. They would strip things down all the way to the vocals and re-fill the blank space with newly recorded guitar, moans of feedback, found-sound samples, processed keyboards, digital litter, and whatever else they could think of. Vig already knew plenty about the trickery that went into making a band sound alive and overwhelmingly present on a record. On Nevermind, he’d used what Krist Novoselic called “electronic sleight of hand” to punch up Kurt Cobain’s performances, patching together vocals to give the impression of a single coherent take. If you could do it with a song, why not construct a band the same way—not by woodshedding demos or jamming with your buds in the garage, but by playing on the computer? By the time Garbage released their second album, Version 2.0, in 1998, they had gone from studio-tinkerer experiment to international pop phenomenon with a Bond theme on the horizon. Despite Vig’s pedigree and the provocative nature of the music itself, they were primarily understood through the lens of image: They were shallow, a studio band fronted by a woman an NME critic called “Skeletor on stilts” who was “$10 billion’s worth of sex on steroids” and was, as one Rolling Stone writer reported once he rolled his tongue back into his mouth, rumored to play shows without wearing underwear. They were “Disco Techs and the Sex-O-Lette,” a good-natured Spin profile jokingly labeled them. The general idea, Manson said, was that she was “the face of the clock and the boys are working the gears.” Manson knew how she would be seen—both physically and as a symbol, a Scottish woman nobody had ever heard of standing in front of Butch Vig’s band, not even playing the guitar—and she knew how that would make people react. She constructed Garbage’s look with great intention, hiring fashion photographers to shoot promo photos and convincing the men to ditch their flannel for tailored suits. If her work as an artist was going to be seen through the lens of her gender, she figured, she may as well play with it and become a virtuoso. “A lot of women still feel like they can’t play up their feminine side and be taken seriously as an artist, but I still see that as suffering at the hands of a male-dominated industry. I love to wear beautiful clothes and I love wearing make-up and I love for people to make me look as good as I possibly can,” she told style mag The Face in 1996. “Being a woman is to be enjoyed just the same as being a man is to be enjoyed.” Manson understood herself as a beneficiary of the work bands like Bikini Kill and Bratmobile had done earlier in the decade, paving the way for women in music to embrace their sexuality without feeling like they had to sacrifice their intelligence. But that didn’t mean she wanted to look like a riot grrrl. “I was aware that alt-girls were dressing sort of tough,” she said years later. “They were all in plaid shirts, jeans, and combat boots. I didn’t want to be like that—not because I didn’t think it was a cool look, but I just wanted to have my own identity and stick out from the crowd.” At a time when people were still calling Courtney Love’s Peter Pan dresses “kinderwhore” in earnest and woman bands like L7 were making a point of looking as ugly as guy bands like TAD, Manson chose glamor: oversized cheetah coats, wraparound shades, electric blue shift dresses, knee-high leather boots. And more than anything: eyeliner. Loads of it. Always carefully applied, always conspicuous in its presence. Every other band on MTV—male or female—seemed to be righteously preserving the dignity of women by subverting rock’s traditional gender roles. Manson was doing the same thing by opposite means, dolling herself to show that even traditional femininity was something you had to work very hard at and that it therefore wasn’t something that came naturally to all women. It was an approach that was ripe for misinterpretation and abuse; an A&R guy told her he “wanked to pictures of me,” she once said. It was risky to gender-bend backwards. Manson’s approach to how she looked was a cosmetic manifestation of the clatter and slick of Garbage’s impeccably arranged electro-grunge, another way of pursuing authenticity by rejecting the aesthetics of authenticity. The faker it all appeared, the realer it all became. The music on their quadruple-platinum 1995 self-titled debut sounded decadently synthetic but still clearly the work of a rock band. You could listen to “Stupid Girl” or “I’m Only Happy When It Rains” and imagine the people playing it. On Version 2.0, Garbage still mostly sounds like a rock band, but it’s nearly impossible to picture the four of them sweating these songs out together on individual instruments; at times it’s hard to believe that the instruments themselves were ever played by a human being. Vig’s signature production on those foaming guitars fills the album, but for the most part they don’t seem to be strummed or picked so much as applied to the walls with a paint roller. He hammers out short, tense phrases, approaching live drums like he’s programming a drum machine. Layers of live and sampled playing pile up in huge stacks, replacing feel or swing with more loops triggered just off the beat. In the album’s most vulnerable song, “Medication,” Manson’s delicate contemplation is swamped by a wall of Loveless noise that’s riddled with crunched-out Antichrist Superstar percussion. Even when Version 2.0 appears to be straightforward—as it does on the unstoppably melodic single “When I Grow Up,” an electro power-pop song that would’ve also been a hit in 1988 or 2008—it sounds as sleek, supersonic, and expensive as the Concorde. Throughout, Manson is in control. Most of the time, she’s calm. Calm in the way that someone who has been hurt and is patiently waiting for the right moment to retaliate is calm. It’s implied that anger is pacing behind the walls of her singing. She dismantles her subjects’ self-images with a single touch. “You still don’t know what you think of me,” she taunts in “Dumb.” In “Special,” she tells a former lover that she’s “spread disease about you over town,” a line made all the nastier by the obvious delight she gets in singing it. Her most brilliant move, just as “Push It”’s chorus is shredded into modem noise and guitar shrapnel, is a stage-whispered command: “Make the beats go harder.” She is perhaps the only ’90s alt-rock icon to have made it through the decade without screaming on a record. That “Push It” line, both the command of the words and the lusty pleasure Manson takes in singing them, may as well be the album’s mission statement. Version 2.0 is dense in detail the way a body is dense in cells: The amount of activity is overwhelming and impossible to take in all at once, so you see it as a unified whole. You have to zoom in to see what feels like millions of tiny parts working together. This is by design. Version 2.0 was one of the first major albums to be recorded entirely with ProTools. Garbage stuffed so many tracks into the interface that they’d crash the program every few days, then ask the ProTools programmers to rewrite the code and update their copy. At one point, the band discovered that the highest number of crossfades the program could support in a song was 65,536. Despite that sense of scale, and a level of studio ambition that rivals Brian Wilson’s circa Smile, Version 2.0 never quite forgets its imperatives as a pop record. It often gets there by reminding people of records they’ve already fallen in love with. There are countless references to other bands, whether direct or otherwise. “Special” nicks its coda from the Pretenders’ “Talk of the Town,” but the bright fingerpicking that rings the song open and the thumping beat that propels it makes it feel like R.E.M. playing every floor of Danceteria; it sounds more like Big Star than the cover of “Thirteen” they’d record for the b-side of the “Push It” single. “I tried, and I tried, and I tried,” Manson sings over a campy cowboy riff in “Wicked Ways,” flipping Mick Jagger’s brag about his unmet libido into her narrator’s frustration at her inability to control her sexual impulses. The multi-layered chorus of opener “Temptation Waits” manages to channel a dozen or so of the most polished singles of the previous decades: “Heart of Glass,” “Into the Groove,” “Sharp-Dressed Man,” a handful of Kylie Minogue songs, “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” The sound that gushes from Version 2.0 isn’t just about flooding the audience with pure pop pleasure, it’s also about what it feels like to live your life swimming through the outpouring of someone else’s heart. Over and over, the album recreates the sensation of being overwhelmed by a great melody, and how a perfect song can inadvertently convince you that a singer’s feelings are yours, too. Something as simple as a good tune can penetrate very deeply into your being and change everything it touches on the way down. Garbage’s self-aware take on being a music fan is also an advantage of age: Once you’ve experienced the complexities of love in the real world, you begin to understand how the three-minute pop song has warped your expectations. Stare into Version 2.0’s oversaturated technicolor for long enough and the acidic, biting pop songs start to sound like comments on decades’ worth of sugary, naive pop songs. When Manson sings about being called codependent in “Medication,” she seems to be singing about a romantic partner; she may as well be singing about music itself. This velvet tension is easiest to feel in the way Manson interpolates the American Breed’s 1967 bubblegum hit “Bend Me, Shape Me” in “I Think I’m Paranoid.” The original is meant to be a cheeky wink at all the things boys will put up with in the name of puppy love. When they sing “Bend me, shape me, any way you want me,” they’re moony-eyed at the idea of where they might be able to fit once they flex a little bit. Manson’s tone seems to be identical—you can imagine her singing into a hairbrush—but she makes two small edits to the lyric, turning it into “Bend me, break me, any way you need me.” The message is clear: A man will go ga-ga for a woman because he knows he can bend himself back at any time; the moment a woman sells herself out to the will of a man, she’s already broken. Manson’s changes spoil the cheery purity of her delivery. It’s plastic, and she wants you to know it: “Prop me up with another pill,” she deadpans in the verses, ”I think I’m paranoid/Manipulated.” By the end of the song, she’s twirling the chorus around her finger, relishing the feeling of having gained the upper hand by exposing how the whole thing works. Later, she coos a bit of the Beach Boys’ “Don’t Worry Baby” in “Push It” just before the music behind her is thrown into a vortex. The sound Vig likened to “a dump truck in a tornado” is the demolition of mid-century pop’s sweet assurances. In their place, Garbage heaps pleasure—the kind of autonomous, self-satisfied pleasure that comes from knowing your own desires. Listen to the way the “Push It” bassline gulps along with a slight reggae tilt, like it’s winding its way through a hail of locusts. Feel Manson’s breath on your ear when she spins into a frenzy of whispers in “Hammering in My Head” and fantasizes about taking a bullet train across the Pacific. Run your hands over the polished speedway chrome of “Special,” with its gleaming harmonies. Surf the gaps in the strobed-out guitars that light up the album, the blank spaces in their rapid firing mimicking the terminator distortion of Public Enemy producers The Bomb Squad. Feel the transgressive prickle as a slither of synth in “Sleep Together” snips the boundary of taste separating Björk and the nü-wave of Orgy. Even the puffed nubs on the album cover are begging to be touched. For years, alt-rock insisted that real music was made by human beings playing physical instruments in the same room. “All sounds made by guitar, bass, drums, and vocals,” went the caps-lock disclaimer in the booklet for all four Rage Against the Machine albums, as if the presence of a sampler or drum machine would invalidate the purity of their message. There were many ways that music could convince you not to love what you wanted to love in the way you wanted to love it; there still are. If the songwriting on Version 2.0 is a rejection of pop music’s content, the album’s essential impossibility—the way it revels in its own artificiality—is a rejection of alt-rock’s forms. Of course, Garbage wasn’t the only band trying to redirect alternative music as it approached the new millennium. Curve had already bridged the worlds of shoegaze and UK club music. Smashing Pumpkins put out the electro-goth Adore the same year, the Prodigy’s fire had already been started, the Spawn soundtrack had become more popular than the film itself, and White Zombie was shuffling techno beats, porno samples, and heavy guitars in a way that suggested a haunted version of America Online. God Lives Underwater, Poe, and the Sneaker Pimps all attempted to siphon some of Massive Attack’s chiaroscuro sexiness to varying success. What nearly all of those bands shared was a conviction that the more rock music merged with electronic music and pop, the grimier, uglier, and more depressing things would become. Humanity—or at least the kind of people who went to Lollapalooza—would be at the mercy of sweaty machines, constantly itchy with overstimulation. Like Hieronymous Bosch plotting out the manifold tortures that awaited the sinner in Hell, these bands, whether consciously or not, showed the dangers of violating alt-rock orthodoxy. In their hyperkinetic music, the five senses became five discrete punishments. There was very little suggestion that the merging of worlds might produce something pleasurable, something that was artful instead of aggro, something empowered instead of deflated. The future, it seemed, would not be female. No rock band did more to shape the techno-utopian vibes of Y2K than Garbage did with Version 2.0. And if our parasocial relationship with technology does feel like a kind of entrapment in 2024, Garbage correctly predicted how gleefully rock artists and alt-music culture would erase the perceived lines between themselves and the rest of the music world. The idea that a band’s ethics can be clearly read in their aesthetics now seems naive; we take it for granted that the way an artist looks and sounds can only tell you so much about who they are. It’s an odd irony that Garbage’s possibilities seemed to narrow almost immediately after they suggested a bigger, better future for rock music. Their theme for the 1999 James Bond film The World is Not Enough was dramatically remixed without their knowledge, burying the boys at the expense of Manson’s voice and a tifo of strings. It was a cliche erasure so baked into the narrative of successful bands with woman singers, Garbage’s tourmates No Doubt had parodied it years earlier in the “Don’t Speak” video. Version 2.0 went on to be nominated for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album at the Grammys, losing respectively to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill and Sheryl Crow’s The Globe Sessions. They were the only Album of the Year nominees not to perform at the ceremony. If their presence at the 1999 Grammys is remembered at all, it’s for Manson’s dress, which, she was mortified to discover when she left the house, was so sheer in the daylight it revealed her breasts. The following year, “Special” lost two other awards to “Scar Tissue” and a Santana collaboration with Everlast. In 1998, Garbage looked like they’d been beamed in from the future. In the year 2000, they looked out place. Their 2001 album beautifulgarbage was a slog to record and came out three weeks after 9/11, when the promise of a more interconnected world suddenly felt like a grave threat. Nobody had any patience for pretension. People just wanted to hear a guitar that sounded like a guitar. Garbage found themselves overtaken by retro garage rock that rejected not only the electro-laced vision they’d plotted out, but also the fattened-up alt-rock that Vig had helped to popularize; the comparatively lo-fi production of the Strokes and the White Stripes was meant to signify a return to something realer, something more authentic, than the grunge that once dominated the radio. It was as if Garbage had depleted the supply of the future, so that by the time that future arrived, it could only look like the past.",0,"September 22, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/garbage-version-2/
Fax Gang,Scattersun,7.0,Rap / Electronic / Rock,"Fax Gang’s hyper-compressed songs sound like murmurs transmitted from virtual reality. The multinational collective—currently made up of Philippines-based vocalist PK Shellboy and producers GLACIERbaby, maknaeslayer, and kimj—are known for bit-crushing Drain Gang-esque vocals and electronics into distorted masses of sound. Parannoul, meanwhile, is a pseudonymous South Korean artist who crafts fuzzy sketches using synthetic instruments like MIDI guitars. Within their insular worlds, each act explores feelings of insecurity and depression through different processes, yet both produce similarly raw music. Fax Gang and Parannoul’s new collaborative album, Scattersun, bursts outward with messy energy. The way Parannoul’s heavy-lidded voice drifts above the sparkling keys of opener “Quiet” might resemble After the Magic, but the song’s movements are volatile and sharp, cresting in sudden explosions that mirror the artists’ anxious mindsets. Written and produced entirely over text, Scattersun is constantly cracking open, expelling static hiss, breakbeats, and stray metallic clangs from its airtight casing. Any space for quiet is often crammed with soundbites, like the rev of a motor or a screwball saxophone solo. To match the blown-out landscape, Fax Gang explore alternatives to the flattened vocals of their previous work. On the twitchy stream of consciousness “Double Bind,” PK Shellboy switches between a partially bit-crushed effect and their unaltered voice, squeezing out enough dread to match the UK garage beat’s foreboding shuffle. Though outclassed by South Korean rapper Mudd the student’s verse on “Wrong Signal,” PK Shellboy’s wheezy rambling is more convincingly paranoid. Their unease sounds visceral: “Time keeps on passing with every day/Yet nothing gets better,” they gasp, voice tense and filled with trepidation. Parannoul remains a characteristically demure presence, anchoring the record with faint keys and a hushed voice. His balmy verse on “Lullaby for a Memory” offers a reprieve from PK Shellboy’s anxiety about growing older, even as it’s pelted with harsh breakbeats. Only on “Soliloquy” does Parannoul’s voice rise to a full-throated scream, a forceful moment overshadowed by the surrounding noise. If PK Shellboy raves about turning into the devil, Parannoul sounds like just one resident of Hell. The lure of Scattersun is its contrasting textures—twinkling riffs against dial-up static and explosive synths over hollowed-out drums. Occasionally, the many layers fuse into a monolith. The title track’s 10-minute span recalls “White Ceiling,” from Parannoul’s To See the Next Part of the Dream, but where that song laboriously built to catharsis, “Scattersun” stitches several ideas together, each demanding equal intensity. “Sometimes/I feel like I’m in a car crash/Nothing I can do to stop it,” PK Shellboy announces at the top. The track’s spontaneous turns from apocalyptic rave synths to gliding four-on-the-floor to condensed noise might replicate the vocalist’s turbulent moods, but those same abrupt changes can be draining to listen to.

Elucid,REVELATOR,7.8,Rap,"Elucid’s music is grounded in observation and elevated by imagination. The New York rapper and producer’s awareness of the precarious world we live in and the body he inhabits charges his songs with the urgency of the times. If his last solo project, 2022’s I Told Bessie, was a brighter, more hopeful counterpoint to the dark soundscapes and stark imagery of some of his past work, REVELATOR is its clear-eyed, clenched-fisted, but no less hopeful successor. “I squeeze my children’s hand and walk hard against the wind” he rhymes on “Bad Pollen,” giving us a mental picture of a man who persists despite the circumstances because he has people to live by and their future to fight for. The kind of indie hip-hop Elucid makes is known for (and sometimes maligned for) its wordiness, but Elucid’s songwriting here is distinguished by his economy of words—not their overabundance. When he says, “My favorite month September/I make gorgeous babies but I’m done makin’ N-words” on “Ikebana” you can hear the words and feel a Black father breaking a curse. Instead of blitzing with vocabulary, Elucid strives to say something emotionally resonant in the fewest words possible. The concise, frenetic songwriting on tracks like “World Is Dog” and the refrains-as-mantras throughout the album make REVELATOR as accessible as it is heady. The lyrics are complemented by a soundscape of noise, ambient droning, glitches, and distortion courtesy of the artist himself along with producers Jon Nellen, August Fanon, Child Actor, The Lasso, DJ Haram, Samiyam, and Saint Abdullah. All of those seemingly disparate elements are held together by live instrumentation—namely drums played by key collaborator Nellen and dynamic live bass courtesy of Irreversible Entanglements virtuoso Luke Stewart. On “Slum of a Disregard” Stewart’s taut bassline propels the track and maintains its groove only as gasps give way to Elucid’s chopped-up voice uttering the words “My landlord ... is a ... Zionist.” Elucid’s baritone is the signal amid the noise. On the album, his voice alternates between musical instrument, tool, and weapon. Sometimes he sounds like he’s reading from a scroll or stone tablet (“CCTV”), other times his tone is as intimate as late-night whispers between lovers in bed together (“SKP”). The themes of resistance, struggle, family, and finding joy amid daily horrors are universal but the references are specific to his experience as a native New Yorker and world traveler. He’s been around the globe but his most poignant reflections on alienation are inspired by life within U.S. borders: “Too many flags/One too many flags/Seeing all those flags outside the city made nervous/Physical reminders I’ve been cursed to concrete,” he raps on “In the Shadow of If.” Any Black New Yorker who has lived in or driven through the “less diverse” parts of Long Island or upstate New York and seen how common it is for homes to fly the U.S. flags paired with “Blue Lives Matter,” “Trump 2024,” or Confederate battle flags can relate to these lyrics. But, if you’re of the same mind as Elucid, you can also relate to the defiance he expresses on the track “14.4”: “I’m in your sundown town holding my dick, dolo.” Without being obvious about it or sanding down any of the rough edges that make his music interesting, Elucid’s done his big one, so to speak, with REVELATOR. It’s a “breakout album” from an underground artist designed for the drama and spectacle of live performance as it is deep listening. But, more importantly, it’s soul food for those who know a better world is possible if we’re willing to fight for it. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Cyndi Lauper,She’s So Unusual,8.0,Pop/R&B / Rock,"As Cyndi Lauper leaped around singing “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” on The Tonight Show in 1984, it seemed like she might never put down the microphone. After she kicked off her stilettos, danced with her backup singers, sprinted back and forth repeatedly from the monitors at the front of the stage to the drum kit in the rear, and belted out the final refrain enough times to ensure that every spectator would be singing it for the rest of the day, the song only ended with the musicians stumbling one by one to a halt: some of them ready to wrap up, and others apparently willing to continue accompanying Lauper until the end of time. “If I wasn’t doing this, Johnny, I might’ve been a brain surgeon or a rocket scientist,” she told Johnny Carson afterwards, refastening her heels and adjusting her jewelry. “A visiting professor at Harvard,” he offered in return. Though the host’s response had a note of condescension for this young woman singer who’d just spent the last several minutes exalting the virtues of a good time above all else, it’s clear that she was in on the joke. There would be no rocket science or brain surgery for Cyndi Lauper: not because she was too fizzy and fun-loving to learn how, but because she was born to perform. There are only three original songs on She’s So Unusual, Lauper’s 1983 debut. Years before its release, she’d been the frontwoman of a cover band. She didn’t need to write songs to express her immense natural talent as a performer. Instead, she used the words of men to illuminate her assertive vision of womanhood, each impassioned yelp a detonation inside its source material. Lauper waffled about ascribing deeper feminist meaning to songs like “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” but there’s a gravity in her vibrato that’s hard to shake. She brought the weight of her past—her childhood growing up in an abusive home, her battles against male industry gatekeepers—into that music. Her voice walks the line between desperation and the self-assurance she gained from playing in bars night after night. It begs, with its technical skill, to be taken seriously, yet is softened by Lauper’s cartoonish inflections that garnered frequent comparisons to actresses like Bernadette Peters more than contemporary female rockers like Pat Benatar. “That’s all they really want,” she belted on “Girls” with more than a hint of indignation, as if to say, Is that seriously so much to ask? With She’s So Unusual, Lauper shoehorned rebellion into the familiar, both musically and visually: Who else would play a 1920s song written for the real-life Betty Boop wearing tulle fingerless gloves and a mullet? With her taste for synthesizer-driven disco (she apparently met with Giorgio Moroder once, but he seemed to dislike that she called him “George”), Lauper helped to usher in an electronic era for popular rock. After decades of being rejected by her peers, local bands, and record labels, Lauper wanted not just acceptance, but an embrace, of not just her quirks, but of eccentricity itself. She’s So Unusual imagined a world where women danced through New York in ruffle skirts and combat boots, partied with a sense of purpose, and were just as powerful at their most vulnerable as their most ferocious. Born and raised working-class in New York City’s outer boroughs, Lauper was too stubborn and strange to succeed at school socially or academically. Her parents, both casually musical, divorced by the time she was five. She and her older sister Elen spent the rest of their adolescence, in Lauper’s words, “dodging pedophiles and the crazy folks,” including their stepfather and grandfather. Cyndi left home at 17 to live with Elen on Long Island, where she worked as a “hot walker” for racehorses at Belmont Park, singing Hare Krishna mantras into their ears to calm them down. In her free time, she auditioned for cover bands that traveled the Long Island bar circuit. By 1974, she landed a gig as a backup singer, and was soon asked to step up for brief solos: “Lady Marmalade,” “Tell Me Something Good.” Once it became clear that Lauper’s voice worked best front and center, she became a permanent lead. Cover bands were an ideal proving ground for Lauper. With her four-octave range and irreverent sense of humor, she reimagined the pop canon, imbuing it with her particular sense of wonder toward the world. Just as she would after finding stardom years later, she twisted other peoples’ words to her own will, cracking songs open to reveal new meanings beneath their popular interpretations. It’s hard to hear her sing Jackie Wilson’s “Baby Workout” and miss how enthralled she seems by her own delivery, adding extra vocal runs as if it’s as easy as breathing. And Lauper’s particularities as a performer offered a counterintuitive kind of universal appeal: If this highly unusual woman with a neon orange buzzcut who spoke like a streetwise Minnie Mouse could convincingly inhabit music from Jefferson Airplane, or the Rolling Stones, or Prince, then maybe those songs were for everyone. Still, she aspired to more than singing other people’s hits. “If you sing ‘White Rabbit’ one more time, just shoot yourself,” she remembered thinking at the time. By the end of the decade, she had formed her own group, the rockabilly-inspired Blue Angel, with John Turi, a saxophonist from her cover band. Critics loved them; they toured with Hall and Oates and the Human League. Lauper was the kind of singer everyone wanted to sign as a solo artist—“Like Chrissie Hynde and Deborah Harry, Lauper possesses the vocal ability to make her stand out,” Billboard raved at the time—but she held out until Polydor agreed to sign Blue Angel as a full band. It didn’t quite work out: After a batch of expensive failed demos, a subsequent lawsuit, and a debilitating vocal cyst, Lauper began the 1980s bankrupt and out of the music industry. She started working at Screaming Mimi’s, the Manhattan costume vintage store where she honed her singular sense of style, combining layered neon skirts with punk’s jagged industrial edges. She hired a vocal coach and connected with David Wolff, who became her longtime manager and boyfriend. By 1983, she found herself in the studio with Turi and producer Rick Chertoff, recording her first album under her own name. Chertoff, an Arista veteran and Clive Davis disciple, saw Lauper as a mouthpiece more than a creative force, someone who could give life to a batch of songs he had been collecting, with his college buddies Rob Hyman and Eric Bazilian of Philadelphia group the Hooters (named after the melodica, of course) backing her up. His selections were scattered: a cult classic from the short-lived pop rock group the Brains (“Money Changes Everything”), a little-known love song by Jules Shears (“All Through the Night”), Prince’s quietly bitter “When You Were Mine.” Lauper’s delivery clearly inflects the latter song’s meaning, her howl supplanting Prince’s coy plausible deniability with an unmistakable sense of raw, real rejection. It was Lauper’s job to make these disparate selections cohere, not just with her singing, but also with her slightly left-of-center musical taste. For She’s So Unusual’s arrangements, she wanted a fusion of synth-pop with reggae and ska; something that sounded like both the Clash and Grace Jones. Just like in her years on the cover circuit, she was forging a voice for herself from the material in front of her. Not every song Chertoff pitched landed with Lauper. She initially balked at what would become the album’s first single, a throwback rockabilly song from an unknown writer named Robert Hazard called “Girls Just Want to Have Fun.” In the original version, Hazard’s male protagonist blames his listless life on the behavior of the women he knows, who understandably just want to relax after work. To Lauper, the lyrics sounded vapid and misogynistic. With some rewriting (and backing vocals) from Brill Building legend Ellie Greenwich, she found a second life for the song as a generational rallying cry. For Lauper, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” spoke to the repressed lives of her mother and grandmother, who were barred from any semblance of a social life outside the home. Changing only a few words—instead of Hazard lamenting that “All my girls have got to walk in the sun,” Lauper exclaims, “I want to be the one to walk in the sun”—they transformed the song’s perspective: from that of a moping burnout trying to placate his disappointed parents to a frustrated woman trapped by staid societal expectations of settling down. Hazard sounded on the verge of tears in his version, his warbling Elvis Costello impression jostled about by the song’s breakneck guitar. Lauper, over synthesizers, gated snares, and a tempo that significantly slows Hazard’s original, sounds triumphant. The more relaxed pace fit Lauper’s delivery, the sound of a woman confidently making her demand for leisure, rather than a boy freaking out about his dating prospects. Her alternating staccato and extended vocals in the song’s opening verse lend a human element with their variations and slight imperfections, balancing out the slick and garish Memorymoog synth. Her vocal hiccups, inspired by Roy Orbison’s, act as the verbal counterpart to the marimba-like synth solo at its center. “Girls” reflected her vision of an electronic ska record, any incongruities between styles patched over by the theatrical flair of her singing. There is a sad irony in the creation of She’s So Unusual: an album about an ostensibly liberated woman, whose creator was surrounded by men who wanted to control her artistic vision. Even “She Bop,” a thinly veiled ode to self-pleasure that was one of the album’s few original singles, came from a directive from the songwriter Steve Lunt, who insisted that “no other girl has done this before.” So Lauper, who never envisioned herself as a glorified cover singer, was ecstatic when Chertoff asked her and the Hooters team for one more original song to complete the album. She went back to the studio with Hyman, stood next to his piano, and began to sing over a four-chord progression he had put together. Hyman and Lauper were both dealing with issues in their romantic relationships, the kind of messiness that comes with detangling lives spent together. He referenced a “suitcase of memories” that he carried around with him after his breakup. She thought of the clock Wolff brought back from his mother after he broke hers, its wind-up tick so unbearably loud that she moved it to the bathroom, only to hear it through the walls. The unwinding second hand of the first verse was real, too: Chertoff’s watch had become demagnetized, and he excitedly showed its machinery moving backwards to Lauper and Hyman in the studio. “Time After Time” used these metaphors to capture the sadness of a breakup: the slow-building resentment in a relationship like a metronome that won’t shut off, or the logic-defying bond between two ex-lovers that can erase years in minutes. Hyman and Lauper originally wrote “Time After Time” with the ska-inspired uptempo groove that drives other She’s So Unusual tracks like “Witness.” But as they continued working, it became clear to them that this song would require a gentler treatment, one inflected with the conflicted feelings of nostalgia, betrayal, hopefulness, and acceptance. That ambiguity is the song’s strength, never fully giving into the sentimental desire for reconciliation or the petty urge to burn bridges. When Miles Davis began to work the song into his set a year after its release, he pulled on those threads, heightening both its triumph and its sadness with his improvisations, just as Lauper made songs her own as a cover singer a decade prior. The album’s sound was only part of its success. Released the same year as MTV came on the air, She’s So Unusual had a symbiotic relationship with the nascent television channel; Lauper hosted its first-ever New Year’s Eve broadcast to close out 1983. At the time of its release, music videos were a relatively new concept: “Brief, Bizarre Films Rekindle Record Industry’s Hopes,” the Wall Street Journal reported that year. The video for “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” looked like Lauper’s life: volumes of hair and fabric heretofore thought unimaginable (styled by Screaming Mimi’s, of course), New York as its centerpiece, a cameo from her own mother. Though the concept might seem trite today—a singer dancing through the streets with a gaggle of backup dancers—its reimagining of a song away from a simple stage performance was groundbreaking at the time. The video also featured professional wrestler Lou Albano as Lauper’s disapproving father, the start of a strange PR campaign cooked up by Wolff in which the singer and the wrestler took part in an ongoing staged feud. Lauper credits the wrestling connection with jumpstarting the album’s sales, but from today’s perspective it looks like just another male directive boxing her in: it’s painful to watch her repeatedly credit Albano and his “P.E.G. principles” (politeness, etiquette, and grooming) in interviews and performances around the album. When Lauper performed on The Tonight Show, after bantering with Carson about her alternate career options, she broke the fourth wall and addressed the crowd directly: “You guys don’t know, but he’s got this whole thing back here,” she said in her over-the-top New York accent. She gestured at Carson’s elaborate set design, apparently fascinated with the artifice of it all, and wanting to bring the audience with her on her journey. She wasn’t some slick industry creation, just a strange kid from Queens, more like the people in the crowd than she was like Carson. She made pop music for outcasts and oddballs: the kind of artist who entered the homes of Americans watching MTV by dancing through the streets of New York and inviting every passerby to join in. Years later, she would win a Tony for her songwriting for Kinky Boots, the unlikely hit musical she wrote with “Time After Time” collaborator Hyman about drag queens and shoe cobblers, applying her career-long belief in the universal appeal of the particular. Lauper succeeded by harnessing the power of the underdog, a quiet majority that she knew was desperate for a voice. As she told Creem in 1984, “There’s a lot of us, aren’t there?” All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Lil Yachty,Bad Cameo,6.4,Rap / Pop/R&B,"When James Blake and Lil Yachty debuted as divisive wunderkinds, they earned feverish acclaim—and controversy—for the way they blurred the lines etched by their predecessors. Blake stormed dubstep’s dancefloor and rendered it a dusty confessional booth; Yachty looked at the hip-hop landscape he inherited, cursed its gods, and spent the beginning of his career at war with a generation. Not everything has changed: They’re still divisive, and they’re still doggedly trying new things. But they aren’t upstarts anymore; nor are their disruptive ideas breaking boundaries so much as reinforcing them. (So long, saxophones, and so long, rap.) A pair that once embodied youthful iconoclasm now often seem to see only as far as their next grievance. More and more, they sound like the gatekeepers who didn’t believe in them years ago. Thus the defensive crossover spectacle of Bad Cameo, their new joint album. Few things announce themselves louder than a tag-team LP by a polarizing producer and an equally polarizing rapper-turned-rocker. But instead of provoking, this record largely takes the low-key road, like a terse postscript to a more transgressive past. It’s dreamy and occasionally danceable, steely electronica rubbing shoulders with a sharp, stadium-ready take on Yachty’s sing-rap sensibilities. The shoulder-rubbing is promising, but at a certain point, when the friction hasn’t progressed any further, the party starts to feel like a corporate lunch: Hey Post-Dubstep, have you met Post-Trap? I’ll leave you two alone to hit it off! Sometimes, they do. More often, Blake and Yachty are cozy in their respective corners, taking turns in the spotlight rather than sharing it. You get the sense that they’re trying to rekindle old magic—the wonders Blake worked with his glitchy soul-searching, the weightlessness Yachty proffered with his pitch-shifted lilts. These elements sound nice next to one another. They’d sound even better if they did more than just coexist. When Yachty released “Poland,” his unlikely 2022 hit single, part of the draw was his quivering, liquid delivery: “It is a really fucking weird song,” Blake told him in a recent sit-down, revealing that it brought him to tears. He’s right to identify the weirdness as jolting—at least enough to channel raw emotion, or inspire it in others. But when they try to accomplish this on Bad Cameo, they sound maddeningly riskless. The title track registers like an attempt to run “Poland” through Blake’s chilly alt-pop processing and produce something equally apt for dorm rooms and sound baths. There’s a repeatable mantra, minimal frills that foreground the vocals, and an air of confession—only now, instead of spiking one another’s worlds, the crossover dilutes their respective strengths. “Did you ever love me?” Yachty begs, in full “Poland” voice, with Blake echoing his prayer in the background. You might recall a similar plea on the 2022 song (“Hope you love me, baby, I hope you mean it”). Where “Poland” producer F1lthy supplied Yachty with a jumpy, trap-infused hotbed, Blake’s canvas is restrictive, limiting the singer to a cramped crying closet both have outgrown. Solemn as it sounds, it’s hard to take very seriously. Part of Bad Cameo’s appeal is the promise of a novel palette: lean meeting lemon tea, hip-hop meeting post-dubstep, confessionalism meeting vanity. Sometimes, as on “Twice,” this works beautifully—a staggered four-on-the-floor beat might morph into something airier, a haggard Yachty and wistful Blake taking turns reveling in their respective terrains. Other times, in moments where you’d expect the contrast to unearth rich new flavors, there’s a dulling effect. “Save the Savior,” a crunchy ballad that sounds a bit like a screen-adapted Future therapy session, would absolutely crush in a ritzy, white-walled gallery. Play it a second time, this time with the pair’s capabilities in mind, and it starts feeling like it should go beyond those insular limits. Blake is coming off his most energetic and danceable record to date; Yachty is freshly removed from a risky, compelling—if controversial—psych-rock dispatch. Considering the boundary-breaking instincts each contributor brings to the table, Bad Cameo feels too safe, too familiar, to tell us anything we don’t already know. The bulk of Bad Cameo’s novelty arrives, instead, in songcraft. To Blake’s credit, he’s a master of seeing tracks as living things, subject to as much growth and meandering as the masterminds who make them. Familiar as they may feel, the most striking songs on this project keep some powder dry, sprawling into realms far beyond their starting places. Midway through “Midnight,” when Yachty and Blake’s harmonized refrain gives way to a beat switch and the drums fall out from beneath their voices, it sounds like they’re prostrate before something powerful. “Woo” begins with an echoey grand piano over a trap beat, no new addition to the annals of introspective hip-hop. But by the chorus, it seems like it’s all falling apart: The drum pattern sputters, and a sly ghost chord gradually infiltrates Blake’s somber progression, culminating in a single jolt of dissonance. You wish there were more room for such uncompromising mischief.",0,"July 1, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-yachty-james-blake-bad-cameo/
Wishy,Triple Seven,7.3,Rock,"You may have heard that shoegaze is having a moment, and that its embrace by a new generation of moody teens has pushed the genre beyond further reverb-drenched horizons. Wishy, a five-piece act hailing from Indianapolis, put their own spin on the trend: Last year’s Paradise EP featured callbacks to the band’s Midwest emo roots while paying homage to Pale Saints and Jimmy Eat World in equal measure. Their full-length debut Triple Seven builds upon that wistful sound—you might call it emo-gaze, or gaze-pop—and matches it to the lethargic possibilities of a suburban summer’s dog days. The album opens with the one-two punch of “Sick Sweet” and “Triple Seven”—both songs about having a crush, written by Wishy’s lead singer-songwriters/guitarists Kevin Krauter and Nina Pitchkites, respectively. With Krauter, the feeling is all hyperbole and desperation. “So starved for the sunshine/Won’t you be mine, be mine, be mine,” he pleads over a barrage of guitars and drums. Pitchkites takes the dreamier route; singing over a backbeat reminiscent of Blue Bell Knoll-era Cocteau Twins, she imagines being carefree enough to fall head over heels with no regrets. Really, they’re two sides of the same coin: The lyrical differences add depth and variety to the band’s style, but at their core, Krauter and Pitchkites are tackling the same universal feelings—infatuation, restlessness, small-town ennui—that have concerned alt-rock bands since the genre’s inception. Despite the occasionally twee subject matter, Wishy also dabble in face-melting pedal effects, especially in the MBV drones on “Game” and Turnstile-like controlled chaos of “Spit.” Drummer Conner Host, who replaced the band’s programmed machines last year, adds a frenzied wall of sound to the mix, pushing the band towards a more hardcore identity. But mostly, Wishy excels at really good pop songs. “Love on the Outside” is the kind of rock-out summer anthem you’d expect to hear on the car stereo 20 years ago, with Krauter belting that earworm of a chorus like he’s been training his whole life for it. Meanwhile, Pitchkites slows everything down for the blissed-out “Just Like Sunday,” describing a getaway fantasy as though she has all the time in the world. The drum machines come back for this one alongside luxuriating synth lines, conjuring up an idyllic version of 2000s pop. The way Wishy combines their grab-bag of influences isn’t always so seamless. On “Busted,” Krauter decides to channel Julian Casablancas, his distorted, disaffected vocals clashing with the song’s buoyant guitar line. It’s catchy, like the rest of Triple Seven, but stalls out by the middle. Still, Wishy’s most cohesive moments come from their knack for memorable, solid melodies. “Persuasion,” with its cheerful, jangling guitars and simple hook—one of the few moments on the album where Krauter and Pitchkites harmonize—would fit easily into a college freshman’s homemade mixtape, or the soundtrack to an aughts teen rom-com. Wishy lean heavily on these nostalgic evocations but aren’t welded to them. Contrary to the literal implications of the shoegaze label, you get the sense that Krauter and Pitchkites are looking ever-outward for their inspiration. Lyrics may not matter as much as vibes on “Little While”—where Pitchkites is doing her best Bilinda Butcher, letting her high register blend into the overall texture of the song—but within that sprawling landscape, she drops a particularly 2020s reference: “Self-driving car/I wonder where you are/You warned me, ‘Don’t get in.’” The mix of old-school dream-pop and hyper-modern metaphor works; you can picture her, in the wake of a breakup, learning to navigate the world without a safety net. It’s those small surprises all over Triple Seven that show Wishy breathing new life into an old formula. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Fucked Up,Another Day,7.3,Rock / Metal,"Fucked Up makes music under the sign of more. Within its prolific output, the Toronto band has made hardcore both denser—piling on tightly orchestrated guitar overdubs—and more distended, stretching out their ideas over baroque, hour-plus albums and a sprawling EP series based on the Chinese zodiac. In recent years, though, the band has been experimenting with less. In 2023, they challenged themselves to make an album—aptly titled One Day—where each member wrote and recorded their parts in just 24 hours. (In August 2024 they took this concept further, livestreaming a daylong album sprint and making the final product available on Bandcamp for another 24 hours. The impulse toward more dies hard.) The result was a tightly focused blast from a band whose releases can tend toward the baggy. As its title suggests, Another Day continues to mine many of One Day’s thematic concerns: making peace with human finitude, taking stock of a damaged world. But instead of short bursts of energy, Fucked Up’s latest release feels like the product of careful sculpting and molding, with a focus on the connective tissue between songs. More than half of the tracks open with a crush of droning fuzz guitars, each shrunk down to occupy a tiny notch of frequencies. It is a new trick for Fucked Up, but it is a logical extension of the role the guitar has long served in the band: not a blunt instrument of aggression, but a diffuser of texture and melody. Here, when the full band kicks in, they aren’t shattering the mirror-pond calm of these guitar soundscapes but skimming on top of them, building on their energy. Part of the excitement of listening to Fucked Up is in hearing how melody emerges from the interplay of layered parts, including Damian Abraham’s orc-bellow vocals, and Another Day features some of the finest and most intricate melodies in the band’s catalog. After the synth-guitar haze dissipates, “Tell Yourself You Will” crashes in with Abraham roaring in sync with a high-string guitar riff, before a gnomic call-and-response (“Oracle!” “New gods!”) introduces a crowd of other voices. The result is a multi-instrument superhook—and an especially glossy, refined version of the kind of hardcore-motivational anthem the band has been writing for years. The thundering “Divining Gods” even sees Abraham taking on the weight of the song’s melody right from its opening salvo: “I can’t escape this feeling/This ain’t a secular society.” “Divining Gods” takes on the classic punk concern of idolatry—the false gods we worship, from billionaires to rockstars to billionaire rockstars—and inverts it. “We’ll make our gods where we can find them,” Abraham chokes out, making it sound less like an indictment and more like a matter of survival. Another Day makes this move repeatedly: It insists on seeing simply making it through as a cause for celebration. On “Stimming,” Abraham describes playing music with his friends as a protective ward against collapse: “My stim protects/From the ways I could get/If there wasn’t a way to just play and forget,” he yowls, making the words sound like an exaltation. Another Day falters when it gets too ethereal and singy—as on the Haliechuk-led “Follow Fine Feeling,” which doesn’t have the melodic juice of his excellent song “Cicada” on One Day—or too straight-up and untextured, as on the plodding closer “House Lights.” But at its best, Another Day showcases Fucked Up as masters of transformation. In their hands a guitar can become a synth, a razor-gargling voice can carry a melody, hardcore can become widescreen indie rock, and white-knuckling through the day can become an act of joyful defiance.

Jawnino,40,7.0,Rap,"Jawnino is prone to the type of errant observations that stumble across your mind when the drugs and drinks are hitting especially hard, glitchy epiphanies spurred by Red Stripe and ketamine. His raps drape languidly over jungle and grime grooves; no matter the BPM, his bars rarely move faster than a jog, refusing to break a sweat. Across his debut mixtape 40, the south London grime rapper comes off calm, cool, and collected—you just wish he’d loosen up a little. Jawnino isn’t too straight-laced for ecstasy or situationships, but he’s no blissfully unaware club rat: hedonistic inclinations aside, his eye for detail can’t ignore the “needles on the pavement” littering a drunk walk home. This gritty realism is paired with a wonky sort of transcendentalism, the kind of simple metaphysics that would lead someone to earnestly deploy a koan like, “If time exists, then it heals.” This is less annoying on record thanks to his ear for instrumentals, which ensconces Jawnino in warping breakbeats and incorporeal synths. These digital backdrops suitably accentuate the placid bounce of Jawnino’s flows, like when he murmurs, “Never went to art school/likkle in me artsy” on “Scr33nTim3” or when he scoffs, “who d’you think brought all the girls outside?” on opener “2trains.” Although his bars can be bland, 40 remains broadly compelling whether stalking through icy nights or throwing its hands up in packed-out nightclubs. Woesum-produced “40wave” buzzes like a brood of cicadas; the wubby jungle of “Lost My Brain” papers over mundane one-liners like, “I need me a leather jacket, I told Renzo I want it in brown.” Jawnino’s stoic vocals rarely betray any serious feeling, leaving emotional regulation up to the producers behind the boards. That can be a problem on slinkier tunes like “Dance2,” where Jawnino adds little to the song’s groove, or on more grandiose tracks like “Wind,” where his smoldering verses are doused by a heavy-handed chorus. Or take the rushing strings of album peak “Westfield.” Jawnino sounds pretty good until fellow Gen Z grime MC Kibo comes barrelling in: “The game is bossman’s fridge/The coldest ones will stay at the back.” Being shown up by your guests can be a mark of respect, but as with the MIKE feature “Short Stories,” Jawnino’s inability to stand tall beside his peers only emphasizes the room he has to grow as a lyricist. A trio of remixes at the record’s close help to tease out latent emotional threads by treating Jawnino as just another musical element to be pitch-shifted and skewed. Evilgiane preserves the squeaky nightcore hook of 2022’s “3styl3” but swaps the spare shuffle of the original for wrecking ball 808s; Airhead ditches the woozy melodies of “Can’t Be” in favor of eerily pinging synthesizers. “sentfromheaven” ranks among 40’s better solo outings thanks to Jawnino sedately detailing a faded tryst, but a remix by Night Slugs co-founder Bok Bok pushes the track into far headier terrain; the effect is akin to seeing the same painting with and without glasses. On his 2019 breakthrough single “It’s Cold Out,” Jawnino turned his steely eye toward the grinding economics squeezing Britain’s working class ever tighter. Here, that same song is appended with an agile new verse that crushes romantic fallout up against the thrill of dating around. Still, even with money coming in, he can’t escape the rat race: “Jawns is hot property like when you got a yard in Shoreditch with no mortgage.” Everything’s paid off—who needs to go hard?",0,"May 3, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jawnino-40/
Remi Wolf,Big Ideas,7.1,Pop/R&B,"Remi Wolf begins Big Ideas with “Cinderella,” a Soul Train-inspired disco-funk number about her everyday mood swings. Bursting with jazzy horns, triangle dings, and chirpy whistles, it’s the feel-good chromatic commotion we’ve come to expect from the Palo Alto artist. The opening track and lead single is saturated with her signature brainworms (“Cinderella making babies on the company’s dime”), but Wolf finds space for the first of many existential questions she poses on her second album: “Is there something wrong with the way I am designed?” Following in the footsteps of her 2021 debut, Juno, “Cinderella” leverages danceable beats and one-liners to mask an undercurrent of vulnerability. The rest of Big Ideas scales back the gimmickry but maintains the infectious energy, mixing Wolf’s DayGlo disco pop with detours into ’60s soul, ’90s indie folk, and psych-y prog rock. “Wave” ebbs and flows between a reggae-ish groove and emo-rock eruptions. On the surface, it comes across as a moody love song, but the Flaming Lips-inspired chorus plunges into Wolf’s anxious mindset. The heart of Big Ideas comes to light in the outro, where she verbalizes her greatest fear: “If I get too fucked up, if I get drunk all night, will you still love me?” The question could be meant for a loved one, an old flame, or even herself: Nothing cuts deeper than self-disappointment. Wolf peppers her songwriting with confessions and anecdotes, like the taste of someone she kissed at Chicago’s Empty Bottle on Halloween (“Cherries & Cream”). She’s refreshingly frank on subjects like sexuality, mental health, and sobriety. “Alone in Miami” recounts a hazy Art Basel week in Miami, cluttered with crypto bros, cocaine, and Cubano sandwiches. In “Toro,” Wolf lets her freak flag fly, spinning unflattering images like “I’m drooling like a rabid dog” into sexy come-ons. It’s no “Eating my ass like the human centipede” (from “Quiet on Set”), but it still hits. “Motorcycle” stands out as a soulful ballad that elevates a mundane premise to the stuff of fantasy. Wolf cosplays as a modern housewife who yearns for secret escapades on her Harley. “I love my motorcycle/It gets me around this funny town,” she sings, syrupy vocals floating over slow, bluesy guitar, “Pass the chaos by in this great big world/Where no one knows what they’re talking about.” Torn between the comfort of stability and the thrill of escape, Wolf ends the song on a poignantly unresolved note. Big Ideas plays like an eclectic compilation of scattered thoughts from her journal. Songs grapple with big questions but offer few answers: “Are you fearful? Do you regret?” she seemingly asks a paramour at one moment. Even “Toro” carries a tinge of melancholy, hinting at the imminent end of a euphoric night. But weaker moments can feel like half-baked ramblings (“The thing about the chase is it plagues the human race”) mistaken for storytelling. “Frog Rock” and “Pitiful”—which sounds like the Teletubbies’ version of “Buy You a Drank”—come off as lightweight goofs. If Juno was a hallucinogenic wonderland that painted the self-declared “Sexy Villain” as a comic figure, Big Ideas works to humanize Wolf’s music without sacrificing its theatricality. Closing disco fever dream “Slay Bitch,” allegedly a bonus track, is the pick-me-up to counteract all the album’s nerves and insecurities. Wolf sounds like she’s commanding you to vogue through your own dress-up montage, somersaulting through the melody with the whimsical attitude of a young Cyndi Lauper. She’s a little bit scattered, and she sounds right at home. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Rachel Chinouriri,What a Devastating Turn of Events,7.5,Pop/R&B / Rock,"Professional declutterer Marie Kondo operates by a simple principle: Every item in her home must “spark joy” when she holds it. If not, it’s on the chopping block. The Japanese term for this now-popular phrase is “tokimeku,” which also literally describes a fluttering heart. Zimbabwean-English artist Rachel Chinouriri dedicates a song to Kondo on her debut, What a Devastating Turn of Events, now released in a deluxe edition. “I’m getting rid of everything/Starting with you,” she declares, her husky voice barely breaching a whisper. Throughout the album, Chinouriri is taking inventory—chasing the tingly feeling that comes with upending the status quo. “The kids are throwing up in the Garden,” she sings of regretful alcohol-filled nights in opener “Garden of Eden,” commencing the album’s theme of purging. The audible click of a cassette tape sets a nostalgic mood: With Sugababes and Lily Allen-inspired kiss-offs (“Never Need Me,” “It Is What It Is”) and thunderous production reminiscent of Coldplay (“The Hills,” “Cold Call”), Chinouriri reveals herself as a fan of the British pop and alternative artists of the noughties. Her neo-soul vocal modulations, internet-age references, and lyrics that center the experience of a dark-skinned woman—“I love myself/I love my skin”—separate her from predecessors. The 25-year-old musician developed a subdued singing style to pacify her family, who would periodically shush her during recording sessions. As grungy whirlpools of guitar threaten to drown her out on “The Hills” and “Cold Call,” she sounds like someone learning to yell for the first time in her life. What a Devastating Turn of Events documents a distinctly Black working-class experience of British life. On the cover, Chinouriri and her guitar stand in front of a council estate row house draped in miniature St. George’s Cross flags. “Really easy for you to pick and choose a woman worthy of your flat in West Croydon with those roadman shoes,” she taunts someone from her South London hometown. With their fluting vocals and bird chirps, her songs could fit on the soundtrack of Michaela Coel’s sitcom Chewing Gum, about a 24-year-old British-Ghanaian woman trying to lose her virginity. Through humor, pop hooks, and scenes of emotional intimacy, both works juxtapose the vibrancy of life with the drab realities of public housing. In her lyrics, Chinouriri tackles heavy themes of suicide, eating disorders, and depression without succumbing to internet brain rot. “Dumb Bitch Juice” may be a social media catchphrase, but Chinouriri’s bluesy tone of voice seems to emanate from an earlier era. “I’ll end up the one/Who pays all of the bills/While your family call me unstable,” she prophecizes, imagining herself giving up a bright future for the validation of a no-good man. She sings with a weariness like she’s lived this dynamic in a past life; more likely she’s simply witnessed it among an older generation. Deluding yourself into thinking you can turn a loser into a supportive partner happens to the best of us, as the accomplished BBC Radio 1 host Clara Amfo affirms in a closing radio drop. “Never Need Me,” the lead single, is Chinouriri’s electric farewell to wastemen and to the version of herself who thirstily laps up their approval. When a former lover comes crawling back, she’s tempted but responds with a shrug: “If you can’t change, I doubt that I can help you.” She’s pettier on “It Is What It Is,” where her monotone delivery conveys pure annoyance: “I know you won’t text or anything, I know what you’re like/Hot and cold, hit and miss, up and down/And a bit of a prick, really.” As lighthearted as the breakup tracks are, Chinouriri conveys just how dangerous patriarchal ideals can be. Title track “What a Devastating Turn of Events” recounts the depressive spiral and eventual suicide of Chinouriri’s cousin in Zimbabwe. After she discovers she is pregnant, her once-adoring boyfriend abandons her and their unborn child. “Out of wedlock which her family despise/But if she lost it, it would still be a crime,” Chinouriri narrates. The women in her extended family did not have the same choices that she enjoys, but Chinouriri recognizes that real, life-altering change requires even more: It means being willing to sacrifice communal approval. “No point in trying to prove yourself to them/Why question who you are from deep within?” she declares on “Garden of Eden.” With tears, feeling, and the occasional fit of vomiting, she salts the soil she once tended.

julie,my anti-aircraft friend,8.1,Rock,"In 1995, Sonic Youth, then 14 years into their career, and on the cusp of a mainstream breakthrough, released a new album, Washing Machine, that closed with a nearly 20-minute song, “The Diamond Sea.” Much of it is a freeform jam of slowly unfurling guitar noise. Seemingly aware of the unpalatableness of a double-digit running time largely given over to feedback, the band released a radio edit of “Diamond Sea,” a fine enough if relatively neutered four-minute version that cuts out the squall. Its purpose was served, to a limit: The song did chart—though never higher than No. 23. Critical success abounded, but the mass market never quite caught on. By the time the members of the Los Angeles band julie were born (about halfway between the release of “Diamond Sea” and Sonic Youth’s dissolution in 2011), the brief promise of a mainstream moment for difficult rock music, in the wake of Nirvana’s success, was long in the rearview. It was now the Obama years. Boom time for Coldplay fans, not so much dissonance enthusiasts. But enter Trump, and dark clouds came to pass, as did middle-school graduation; in 2019, as high schoolers, guitarist/vocalist Keyan Pourzand, bassist/vocalist Alexandria Elizabeth, and drummer Dillon Lee, formed julie. The band’s first single, “flutter,” was released in 2020, a year in which talented young devotees of experimental rock music had plenty of reason to shrink from the known world and swath themselves in oceanic swaths of reverb. julie emerged fully formed on “flutter,” a tightly wound grunge-pop rager with Pourzand and Elizabeth trading vocals, both pleasingly apathetic. That song, like most of the rest of their subsequent songs, was propelled by a totally ballistic drum performance by Lee. They were influenced by Sonic Youth, clearly, but they had little interest in that band’s atonal wandering. Julie’s power was controlled out of the gate. Over the next three years, the group released a handful of EPs and singles, experimenting with slight shifts in sound. One song might skew more tortured emo, another more triumphant shoegaze. The brusque sheen of the Big Muff pedal is ever present, but they never overindulge in fuzzed-out theatrics. They never noodle too long. Only one song on the band’s debut album, my anti-aircraft friend, clocks in at over five minutes—and then only by three seconds. It seems that in a generation (or two) since the heyday of their preferred breed of experimental rock music, julie have mastered the task of making songs that feel sprawling and massive, but which in reality bloom and dissolve in short order. You can fit a lot of julie songs into one “Diamond Sea.” No radio edit needed. Now in their early 20s, julie are of the TikTok-native generation, and one lesson that social media has burned into the brains of young people is a need for brevity in storytelling. Consciously or otherwise, the short songs on my anti-aircraft friend are alt-rock epics told in miniature. This tightening of the sound seems to have provided a breakthrough: “flutter” has over 36 million plays on Spotify. I’d imagine my anti-aircraft friend will break them to a new level. It should. Across the album’s 10 songs, julie have honed their sound, alternating between crunch and jangle, all with great clarity. They’ve generally benefited from a bright mixing job and a sharper fidelity recording. Elizabeth’s bass is up front for many tracks, not providing a counterpoint to Pourzand’s guitar shred so much as a contrapuntal bludgeoning. Across the entire album, Lee plays the drums with the rage of a gorilla pounding its chest. It’s not exactly a chill listen. So it can be intense in Julie’s wind tunnel, but moments of reduced pace interspersed throughout help you catch your breath. “Very Little Effort” opens with a strutting bass solo, a quick moment of levity, before Elizabeth reads off a list of (mostly) adjectives (“muted/calm/malaise”) before the song kicks in like a terrorist attack on a poetry reading. Things ramp back up on the next song, “Clairbourne Practice,” which alternates between warp-speed thrashing and snotty harmonics. The song switches between movements brazenly, but without any bleeding between its parts. From a lesser band, this sort of thing could give you whiplash. Here, it’s thrilling—music to make your pupils dilate. Between Elizabeth and Pourzand, Elizabeth is the more beguiling vocalist, with her laissez-faire sneer most effective at reeling you in before the song bonks you on the head. And so the songs where she is lead are the highlights. “Feminine Adornments” features some of the album’s best lyrics. Other songs can be a bit cryptic (haven’t quite been able to puzzle out the meaning of “​​Shaolin monks they finally freak/Your little birds come all this way/One like you, for a mutt like me”), but “I’ll defile/I’ll be clean/I’ll be mean and raw,” feels like something you scratch into your desk with a pen knife. As much as I love this record, it would be naive to not admit that this type of thing has been done before. The tortured punch of Unwound, the sour rage of Hole, the distorted sass of Jesus and Mary Chain, and, of course, the everything of Sonic Youth. Right now, this sound has legs, and julie find themselves playing alongside a group of young bands who’ve similarly been entranced by the music of the ’90s. But Julie are just better than their peers. They’ve figured out how to absorb their influences while iterating their way into innovation. On each song, julie sound more like themselves: burrowing, burrowing, burrowing, each song digging deeper into the soil. Nowhere is their vision clearer or more effective than on my anti-aircraft friend’s opener, “Catalogue.” At about two minutes into the song—which until that moment has primarily moved with hurricane force—things get really slow and quiet. There’s an ominous plucking of the bass and a small shimmer of guitar, the kind of sound you get when you strum the strings on the headstock, the part you’re not supposed to play. And then, after that moment of respite, the band comes roaring back. There’s a squall of feedback that you think could last forever. With other bands, it would. But it doesn’t come to pass. Instead, the song gathers itself for what seems could be a ramping up to violent explosion. Ok, you think, here it comes. But that doesn’t happen either. What does happen to the song is a surprise: It ends. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Sam Gendel,The Doober,7.6,Jazz,"About a quarter of the way into “Sweet Fire,” Sam Gendel interrupts himself with a raspy, scraping yelp. Moments before, he’d been skronking away on his C-melody saxophone, lobbing a torrent of notes into the spaces around Sam Wilkes’ bouncing bassline. Suddenly, his voice erupts, as though he’s been stung by a hornet or grabbed hold of a searing hot pan. It’s not a howl of pain, but a fleeting exorcism, the power of the jam compelling him to release the spirit. In true call-and-response jazz tradition, he puts the sax back to his lips and conjures a couple of equally coarse honks from the instrument before resuming his dexterous cascade. That flash of primal joy succinctly conveys the feeling of discovery permeating The Doober, the third album in the Los Angeles experimental jazz duo’s Music for Saxofone and Bass Guitar series. As on their first two records, the pair culled these songs from live performances, editing out the audience but keeping the crackling energy intact. Studios allow artists to shape, overdub, and edit their way into an idea, but playing live is inherently raw; feeling the vibe of a room, communicating without speaking, and leaving space for chance are more immediate paths to transcendence. The Doober is another document of these musicians’ innate chemistry and trust, finding magic in the journey with no real destination in mind. Many of these songs are covers—or at least they start that way. There’s nothing especially faithful about these versions; Gendel and Wilkes are more interested in spacious textural exploration. On “Rugged Road,” they extract the chorus melody from Judee Sill’s yearning psych-folk classic “There’s a Rugged Road” and turn it into a wriggling, cartoonish mass. As the intensity builds, Gendel and Wilkes somersault over each other, layers of sax and bass swirling into a Tasmanian Devil cloud before collapsing, grinning and exhausted. In their hands, Joni Mitchell’s “The Circle Game” becomes a modal study, shifting around itself like a deconstructed Rubik’s Cube. As the minimal drum machine pattern gets more motorik, Wilkes locks his Fender P-Bass into a repetitive groove while Gendel builds a tower of looped drones. Each track on The Doober is a framed photo of outer space, presenting the infinite in a digestible container. They’re not innovators of form here—jazz musicians have long treated entries in the canonical songbook as blueprints rather than maps. Gendel and Wilkes do it with a cheeky sense of abandon. Their choice of interpolations is sometimes absurd—who knew there was such an aching, rain-streaked jazz number at the heart of Sheryl Crow’s “Tomorrow Never Dies,” the opening theme for perhaps the worst James Bond movie? In the final minute and a half of “Ben Hur,” one of the album’s finest moments, the duo’s cover of Miklós Rózsa’s “Love Theme (From Ben Hur)” melts deliciously into Chris Isaak’s “Wicked Game,” Gendel’s sax pooling around a bizarre clip-clop percussion loop. There’s a palpable glee to the album, an almost mischievous acknowledgment that any piece of music can become an invitation to greater freedom.",0,"May 7, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sam-gendel-sam-wilkes-the-doober/
Jeff Mills,The EyeWitness,7.2,Electronic,"In techno, Jeff Mills is one of one, and he continues to move further from the genre norm. A remarkably prodigious icon who remains deeply associated with Detroit (though he splits his time between Paris and Miami), the 62-year-old DJ/producer is unwilling to be bound to the sounds and ideas that once defined him. A long-time sci-fi adept, he continues to use the language of techno—much of which he almost single-handedly pioneered—to comment on present-day dystopias or suggest new potentialities for anyone still willing to listen. Though Mills’ time as a turntable wizard, Underground Resistance co-founder, and techno’s ultimate ambassador and autodidact informs every inch of his music, the context of his work has stretched beyond dance culture into something wider and headier. Mills’ compositions are humanist and often highly collaborative, and created in a self-imagined environment (Black American future music gone global, fluent in advanced technology and showing Borgesian comfort with the boundlessness of storytelling), with an eye to continuously revolutionizing the milieu they came from. He remains a dance festival headliner (though, pointedly, very rarely in America), yet the stimulation behind his vast recorded output seems more focused on the mind than the ass. The EyeWitness, Mills’ second album of 2024 and one clearly reflecting the dark night of today’s human soul, is a good opportunity to hear how an electronic- and dance-music originator pushes the fruits of his legacy toward a more imaginative discourse. (It’s also one that’s easier to hear, period: After years of being unavailable on streaming platforms, the full-length releases on Mills’ Axis Records are now an easy click away.) It is a set of listening techno that, according to Mills’ liner notes, addresses the effects of shock and trauma on the contemporary condition. That The EyeWitness may have (almost) nothing to do with dancing reflects Mills’ belief that techno’s purpose and history are grounded in principles of future freedoms, intellectual mysteries, and cosmological phenomena, rather than mere physical reaction. The EyeWitness’ reaffirms Mills’ marriage of thematic narrative, psychology, and sound, and it has plenty of precedents in the producer’s recent work. His second (!) score for Fritz Lang’s classic 1927 silent film, Metropolis, released in 2023; the exploration of feeling and knowing of 2021’s more rhythm-driven The Clairvoyant; his six-part 2018 radio series The Outer Limits, made with NASA for London’s NTS Radio about the universe and astrophysics—each is a spectacular piece of musical sci-fi storytelling that questions known life’s governability, and brings to mind Samuel R. Delany more than any electronic composer or producer. Yet at their shared musical center rests what may be Detroit techno’s most crucial contribution to modern sound: layers of musical tension without release, chord patterns that don’t resolve, beats that keep unfolding, a music that embraces mystery with no clear ending. It’s a strategy that stands in direct opposition to EDM’s almighty drop and pop’s built-in limitations. It’s also a great metaphor for one way that Mills and the techno culture he represents regard the composition of a track and a set, and what they intuit the payoff to be. Not only are there no drops on The EyeWitness, there’s barely a kick drum. Only “Indoctrination,” which closes the vinyl release (streamers include four additional, primarily beatless tracks), resembles what a club environment might expect from Mills: a fat four-note loop and bass kick as a maypole for trademark 909 hi-hats to dance around. Even here, layers of synths pile on overdrive-building energy, jabbering like aliens in the background of a scene they actually dominate. Mills’ theme—the way that trauma changes people, and ingrained wounds destroy our relationships with the world and each other—is admittedly a heavy lift for instrumental electronic music, however freeform. The topic is a potential broadsheet of discontent, so Mills’ text purposefully refuses to get stuck in either partisan- or identity-centered moans. What the music does express is the ubiquitous dread brought on by hurt’s cognitive effects. Much of Mills’ argument rests on provocative titles, matched by the kind of technologically updated tricks of the sci-fi trade not unfamiliar to UR soldiers or Vangelis stans. Except that Mills long ago reimagined these tricks. Tracks like “In a Traumatized World,” with Mills’ synthesized voice cut up into a chattering invented language that would make Lucasfilm proud, and “Menticide,” a post-WW2 word that describes torturous interrogation techniques meant to reshape a person’s will, are underpinned by sonambient sound effects, synth textures, and haunted melodic figures. This spooky foundation represents the album’s throughline, though, at times, other textures reinforce the nightmarish scenario: “Mass Hypnosis” builds into something approaching a swirl of digital koras and Giorgio Moroder’s Midnight Express sequencers, while “Pledge to the Sacred Iridescent Mirror” centers a martial beat and a minimalist bassline. Overwhelmingly, The Eyewitness is bathed in history’s shadows, unspoken but ever-present. Only once does Mills step back from the darkness toward something more polychromatic, reflecting the unexpected metamorphosis when trauma begets beauty. “Wonderous Butterfly” is built on the shipwreck of a musical trope (the chopped recasting of the “Oriental riff”), built into dub-like, looping scaffolding that is the album’s least futurist moment. The track’s two lead lines—one that sounds like a synthetic clarinet, the other like a percussive electric piano—harmonically discolor any sense of cliched meaning, weaving instead into a mysterious, emotionally complicated concerto. Purposefully or not, the riff, the title’s lepidoptera, and the clarinet bring to mind Puccini’s “Madame Butterfly,” a classic product of colonial art whose historic trauma plays in opera houses worldwide. The EyeWitness’ “Butterfly” provides a counter-argument that is part of the whole, a momentary escape from the machines, a simple dance of remixing history in the timeline’s other direction. It’s also proof that Mills’ techno storytelling keeps reasserting itself as a narrative form as complicated as its topics, and as the world that brings them to mind.",0,"July 18, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jeff-mills-the-eyewitness/
Gastr del Sol,We Have Dozens of Titles,8.4,Rock,"In a 1998 interview, David Grubbs once perfectly described the mysterious, impossible-sounding music he and Jim O’Rourke briefly conjured as Gastr Del Sol. “Every record saw us determined to create a different group with each song,” he said, capturing an amorphous quality running through their trio of perception-shattering albums, as well as the project’s initial debut as an entirely different group. Grubbs started Gastr Del Sol in 1991 with Bundy K. Brown and John McEntire as an acoustic shift from their hardcore trio Bastro. Meanwhile, O’Rourke, emerging from the avant-garde music world, joined after one album just as Brown and McEntire were focusing on their own project Tortoise. Each album the duo made together—1994’s Crookt, Crackt or Fly, 1996’s Upgrade & Afterlife, and 1998’s swan song Camoufleur—feels like a classic of its era, but what many miss is how exciting, disorienting, and bizarre Gastr Del Sol could get on just a single, compilation track or the rare live performance. In the remarkable archival collection, We Have Dozens of Titles, Grubbs and O’Rourke shine a light on those obscure songs and oddities forming the shadow of an album that feels as rewarding as their main ones. Paired with recently discovered recordings of their final performance, it captures how this duo could feel so alive and unpredictable, across the span of a song or an entire discography, from a first rehearsal to a final show. Listening to Gastr Del Sol’s music is like trying to grasp smoke. A soft piano chord, the hum of a harmonium, or a fingerpicked knot of John Fahey-inspired guitar might cast a sprawling shadow of musique concrète, erupt in guitar feedback by noise artist Kevin Drumm, or swoon into an orchestral sample from a ’50s monster movie like The Incredible Shrinking Man. In one breathtaking moment on “The Sea Uncertain,” from Upgrade & Afterlife, a whistling tea kettle and a screaming internet modem form a quiet duet. Dozens begins with a work-in-progress, a live version of “The Seasons Reverse” found on unearthed recordings of the band’s final performance at the 1997 Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Québec. While the version that would appear a year later on Camoufleur adds McEntire’s hypnotic polyrhythms, glitchy electronics from Oval’s Markus Popp, flourishes of steel drum, elastic cornet, and Grubbs’ jubilantly surreal wordplay, the song’s most miraculous twist is already fully formed live. Its dense guitar work spirals endlessly deeper until the pop of Grubbs’ strings is as big as exploding fireworks. And then, as O’Rourke sneaks a field recording into the mix, you realize there are fireworks. It’s a humbling, beautiful climax that’s suddenly interrupted by an inquisitive French voice, then O’Rourke’s stammering “Don’t worry, keep doing it! It’s a microphone…I’m recording you blowing off firecrackers…” The moment simply blows up in O’Rourke’s face as he desperately tries to explain and salvage things with the perturbed stranger he’s been recording, only offering further apologies that he can’t speak French. As a field recording it’s a stroke of genius—while simultaneously roasting themselves and field recordings. That concert offers more surprises like “Ursus Artcos Wonderfilis” from the 1991 debut The Serpentine Similar, the sprawling “Onion Orange” from Grubbs’ debut solo album, and another Camoufleur stunner, “Blues Subtitled No Sense of Wonder,” which leans even harder into its piercing organ melody. Grubbs’ tender vocal performance (including the lyrics where this collection takes its title) isn’t present yet, but a warped TV-sampling interlude that never made the final cut provides a jarring delight. While the studio recordings on Dozens have all technically been released somewhere, they find a far better home here together. “Quietly Approaching”—which initially appeared on a Red Hot charity release—shines as one of Gastr’s most mysterious pieces. Its ominous textures and chords hang in the air before a brass ensemble erupts midway. “At Night and At Night” is a highlight not only of the Grubbs/Brown/McEntire era, but of the nascent days of the legendary Chicago label, Drag City—its angular peaks originally fitting comfortably on the Hey Drag City comp alongside early Smog and Pavement. It feels true to the project’s time-bending spirit that Dozens’ shortest and longest studio tracks are its two most memorable. “The Japanese Room at La Pagode,” off a split with the late Tony Conrad, captures two minutes of the duo’s most precise and fractured sounds, from the single-second crack of percussion and Grubbs’ soft piano leading to a cold vacuum of humming electronics. It lingers just to the point of discomfort before a blast of digital noise signals Grubbs’ gentle coda. Meanwhile, the 17-minute epic “The Harp on Factory Street,” originally released as a standalone, functions even better here as an album-within-an-album. Gastr bloom into a 10-piece band, building a towering dirge in the first half before growing so quiet you can hear the chairs creak. People often get to Gastr Del Sol looking for “more” of something and find a band that sounds like nothing else. It’s why people collected these rarities over the years, chasing any scrap of sound they could from this strange, mysterious project. And it’s why the notoriously self-critical O’Rourke also once perfectly described Gastr Del Sol in a 2018 interview with Stereogum: “This is gonna sound weird, but we were fucking great.” More than 25 years later, O’Rourke and Grubbs have polished and stitched together every scrap and forgotten rarity into one final album, closing off their beloved project as finely as a tape loop.

Molina,When you wake up,7.6,Pop/R&B,"What would happen if all day long we focused on the repetition of a single rhythm: the ticking of a clock, a ceaseless hiccup, or the two-step thud thud of a heartbeat? When you wake up, the debut album from Danish Chilean artist Molina, gives an idea. Written largely while Molina was pregnant—a state of life defined by its sheer duration—the album is an exercise in intense presentness, one that holds the awe and exhaustion of embodied existence. On it, Molina figures the body as a musical instrument. She plays guitar at the rate of breath. She sings, either airily or droningly, like she’s feeling her way around her own throat. When she strikes her percussion—whether an acoustic drum set or a sampler—she aims for the bones. Molina titled her first EP Corpus, the Latin word for “body,” and her work is indebted to the classical idea that musical rhythm arises from our bodies. The central nervous system transforms repetition into rhythm. Vibrations modulate into mood. A pulse becomes a beat. Molina straddles this conversion point between the biological and the musical. Molina is among a coterie of musicians from Copenhagen, including ML Buch, Erika de Casier, Astrid Sonne, and Clarissa Connelly, who studied at Denmark’s esteemed Rhythmic Music Conservatory—a school that encourages individualist experimentation, and, more crucially, doesn’t charge for admission. Among the alumni, Molina’s thickly textured, almost gelatinous music is most comparable to that of Buch, with whom she’s toured. Both artists possess an almost academic interest in the intersections between bodies and machines, a bookishness disguised with distractingly good pop melodies. Molina is more surgical in her approach: Like a nurse on the night shift, her music is always searching for a pulse. Molina begins When you wake up, as Buch began last year’s Suntub, in a state of blissful isolation: On “Navel,” there’s nothing to attend to, just the pleasure of disconnection. Guitars ring like tiny timbale bells. Molina’s voice goes toe-to-toe with the sound, a stone that floats upon every wave. “When I’m all alone/On the eagle’s chest,” she sings, like she’s floating or flying, while her music complicates her dreamy freedom. She plays in an ambiguous scale, giving the song an indeterminate mood that no two listeners will interpret the same way. Her approach to guitar, and to songwriting in general on When you wake up, borrows from shoegaze. Each song is a wide and woozy landscape: “A New Day” a pixelating sunset coming in and out of focus, “I Am Your House” a Mica Levi-like city garden. It is as disarmingly romantic as any shoegaze record, and just as impressionistic. Like the best shoegaze records, When you wake up plays with listeners’ perceptions, specifically the ability to detect underlying rhythms for ourselves. It’s most clear on the Buch collaboration “Organs,” which sounds like it’s timed to a million different metronomes. If a doctor were to scan the brain playing it, the MRI would bloom with color. Finding the pulse on When you wake up requires tuning the attention and locating a sense of time through our own psychobiological rhythms: a new kind of presentness that disturbs everything around it, turning the familiar surreal.",0,"October 15, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/molina-when-you-wake-up/
Rahim Redcar,HOPECORE,7.3,Pop/R&B,"Across his decade-long body of work, Rahim Redcar—the artist known until now as Christine and the Queens—has tangled in the interplay between sexual and spiritual surrender. A dynamic, expressive singer, he’s nurtured a perennial fascination with the ways those experiential extremes play out across the body—how the diaphragm lurches when an encounter with the divine drops you to your knees, how the thrill of an irrepressible attraction can catch in your throat. He’s no stranger to being overcome. Though tinges of dance music have embellished Redcar’s music for years, like the acid bass on “Feel So Good” and the echoing polyrhythms on “Je Te Vois Enfin,” he’s largely worked inside a glossy, midtempo pop mode. Most of his songs wouldn’t sound out of place in a downtown coffee shop or chic new bar, but probably wouldn’t inspire anyone to break a sweat in a club basement. With his new album HOPECORE, Redcar seeds physical abandon into the beat. For the first time, he plunges into dancefloor reverie across the length of an LP. It leads him to some of the most impassioned vocal performances he’s ever put to disc. Following two knotty concept albums, 2022’s Redcar les adorables étoiles (prologue) and last year’s collaborator-studded triple LP Paranoïa, Angels, True Love, HOPECORE is refreshingly immediate. Redcar produced and mixed the record on his own, undertaking what he called “an absolute quest where no one else came in to tamper with intentions.” He’s a reverential student of house music history, seizing on the idea of club as church from Frankie Knuckles’ sets at Chicago’s Warehouse in the 1980s and tracing it through the starry-eyed remixes of George Michael and Erasure singles that turned dancefloors into planetariums through the 1990s. What better setting is there to sing unfettered about the embodied pleasures and existential terrors of gay sex? After a handful of somewhat elusive tracks that sound less like the announcement of a new era and more like we’ve tuned into an obscure dance night where the DJ is still getting warmed up, HOPECORE kicks into gear with “DEEP HOLES.” A throbbing kick, burbling vocal chops, and classic house piano accompany Redcar on his noble hunt for hole. “From the tip of your soul to the flesh of my eye,” he sings in an intoxicating lead melody that eases beautifully into the depths of his range. “Say my name as I’m inside.” He’s never sounded so assured or delighted in his hunger as he does here. Historically, dance producers tend to work with other people’s voices, weaving vocal lines into a beat at a remove. They don’t often carry the somatic memory of singing the songs they’re crafting. As both producer and singer on HOPECORE, Redcar populates a universe by himself. This expansive solitude has its advantages, as on the album’s 20-minute centerpiece “OPERA - I UNDERSTAND,” where a queasy beat mutates beneath intersecting layers of his searching voice. It’s a beautiful, harrowing track that drags Redcar’s voice to such a rich place that I wonder if he didn’t record most of it in a single take, letting himself get tired, letting the vulnerability of exhaustion color his words. The vocals and instrumentals bleed into each other in perfect communion, a symbiosis likely catalyzed by Redcar’s dual role. But some of the album’s early tracks, like the slick, pounding “INS8DE OF ME,” play a little flat due to this one-man operation’s lack of parallax. On the bilingual “RED BIRDMAN EMERGENCY” (a callback to Redcar les adorables étoiles’s “My Birdman""), Redcar’s echoing harmonies shower down over minor-key strings and a marching beat. It’s all tension and gritted teeth—“I don’t know to express further the anger I have,” Redcar sings, “against this world who keep on playing us small.” His voice sounds as dislocated as his grammar, shadowed in reverb under a menacing bassline as he snarls against the marginalization of queer life. Then, halfway through the track, the fog dissipates. An Italo-disco pulse bounces in; choral backing vocals flood the space, transforming it into a cathedral, and Redcar lilts up into his falsetto. “In the air/We are converging/In the flesh/We shall ignite,” he promises. “This is a red birdman emergency/This is just how good you appeal to me.” Sometimes the current between two bodies supersedes all possible preoccupations on earth. Sometimes the beat lifts you both up to heaven.",0,"September 28, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rahim-redcar-hopecore/
Horse Jumper of Love,Disaster Trick,7.9,Rock,"When Dimitri Giannopoulos was a teenager, he thought he might be living in a dream. Alienated, anxious, and unsettled, he tried his hardest to process a world that he felt disconnected from. “I refused to believe anything I was seeing was happening to me or even happening at all,” he told Allston Pudding in 2016. “I was just freaked out by everything.” He says that he’s since outgrown his existential angst, but similar feelings have clearly found a home in the slow-moving gloom of the songs he makes in Horse Jumper of Love. The forms of those songs have shifted occasionally over the years—from hushed, stripped-down recordings that recall Phil Elverum’s sky-gazing folk songs to distressed lo-fi experiments in the mold of Bedhead’s desperate slowcore to the odd Siamese Dream cover—but they’re all united by Giannopoulos’ oblique approach to songwriting. His lyrics are vivid but fragmented and opaque; he frequently sounds like someone describing a dream as their eyes slowly open. On the band’s new album Disaster Trick, Giannopoulos often does just that. He recalls or references dreams in four separate songs, and throughout the record, his writing is similarly disorienting and enigmatic. On opener “Snow Angel,” he sings of funerals and drownings, of looming evil and a desire to be alone. Elsewhere he meditates on emptiness, witnesses bloodbaths, and remembers, through a haze, an argument that went too far. It’s hard to piece together concrete narratives, but his cryptic koans and foggy memories have a strangely affecting power. For all the uncertainty and malaise reflected in the lyrics, Disaster Trick is full of some of the band’s most focused and direct arrangements. The component parts of each track are the same: languorous guitar lines from Giannopoulos and weighty contributions from the rhythm section of drummer James Doran and bassist John Margaris. But the band has more focus and purpose this time around. Giannopoulos says it’s the first time they’ve ever actually approached the recording process with a clear head, rather than “just show up at a studio, drink, and record,” and it shows—murky as the lyrics may be, the playing is grounded and crushing. The snowblind shoegaze dirge of “Snow Angel” taps into a new kind of heaviness for the band. And even when they operate in more familiar, slowcore-inspired modes, as on the leaden “Wait by the Stairs,” they bring compelling new elements to their sound. That song’s sludgy arpeggios and trudging rhythms are ballasted by airy harmonies from Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman; the deliberate ornamentation feels like a genuine innovation for a band that’s often favored more spartan arrangements. With Disaster Trick, Horse Jumper of Love subtly expand their sound without losing the instinctual, otherworldly interplay of their melodies, dizzying guitar lines and serpentine rhythms blurring together in a narcotic ooze. It’s a fitting accompaniment, as ever, for Giannopoulos’ somnambulant murmurs. Carried by his detached delivery, the songs mirror the feeling of spacing out on the couch after a particularly rough day, the grim details of what you went through floating numbly in the periphery of your awareness, always just out of reach.

Shaboozey,"Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going",7.7,Folk/Country / Rap,"In mid-April, after struggling for a decade to find a new intersection between country and hip-hop, Shaboozey released “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” amid the wave of adulation that followed Cowboy Carter, the Black country maypole on which he appeared twice. It seemed like the epitome of a one-hit wonder. A near-universal anthem about despising your job that barely begets survival and drowning in as many rounds as the bartender can summon, it became a near-universal sensation, streaming three million times in 24 hours and charting all around the world. After all, how could a whistle-out-loud interpolation of a 20-year-old J-Kwon smash that nodded to the Black roots of Jack Daniels while towering atop the lily-white country chart not be a flash in the pan, some glitch in the Music Row matrix? This was surely Shaboozey’s “Achy Breaky Heart” and “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,” his mainstream introduction and farewell all at once. But Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going does not feel like a mere receptacle for one of the year’s most unlikely hits. Shaboozey’s remarkably assured third album is a sophisticated self-help journey that only occasionally masquerades as a good time. He has spent a long while trying to find some space where the sounds of hip-hop and country could overlap, where the defiant swagger, nostalgic circumspection, and quivering heartbreak of both genres could fuse together. The parties of “A Bar Song” and “Drink Don’t No Mix” offer the same sort of escapes that he suggests in “East of the Massanutten” or “Let It Burn,” where the Great American West becomes the frontier for fleeing, respectively, the persecutions of the South or an abusive relationship. Shaboozey seems to always be asking how we can last a little longer and live a little better in this strange place, even as he’s grinning while reaching for another shot. If you’re the type of listener who writes off the last dozen years of mainstream country music, especially its best-selling bro-country core, as bullshit, Where I’ve Been will at first sound like a tough hang. He uses Auto-Tune to exaggerate the contours of his drawl during cowboy-coopting opener “Horses & Hellcats,” a trick he nevertheless smartly returns to. He favors processed, billowing harmonies that emphasize his epiphanies, as on “Highway,” the frustrated testimonial of a traveler almost broken by the choices that make him alone. And he inches toward rap, his voice oozing over the second verse of “Vegas,” where he stares into the bottom of his emptied cup and empty life with deep shame. “Came out of the gutter, covered in dirt/Got it all over me,” he offers, each brief pause landing like another jab into his own ribs. Wait: Songs about the wrong end of the bottle and the weary traveler far from home, plus references to the mighty strides of beautiful Palomino horses and Dan Post boots? Indeed, Where I’ve Been is, in some regard, a wildly reverent country album, from its opening sonic triumvirate of whistling wind, pedal steel, and acoustic guitar through its banjo-traced closing trot complete with a fiddle solo. Every song here hinges on the acoustic guitar, whether it’s the rhythmic R&B-style loop that anchors “Drink Don’t Need No Mix” or the massive, major-chord strums of “Anabelle.” Shaboozey purportedly wrote an entire country album before Lady Wrangler, his chimerical 2018 major-label debut that flopped in part because he could not decide how its constituent pieces cohered; Where I’ve Been works so well because he starts clearly with country, then rearranges it to fit his needs. Those needs almost invariably involve what’s next and better. This forward gaze is the true hip-hop element of these 12 songs. “East of the Massanutten” is a remarkable piece of work. He alludes to the Confederate king of guerilla warfare, John Mosby, to justify his drive to head west and seek out “a land full of dreams/With milk, gold, and honey/Just waitin’ for me.” It’s an emancipation song, as are “Anabelle” and “Let It Burn,” overdue goodbyes to lovers who will not stop wrecking your life. “My Fault,” his gorgeous duet with Noah Cyrus, is a radical counterpart to Waxahatchee’s “Right Back to It”; rather than return to a relationship’s welcoming stability, both parties seek it by striking out separately to escape a cycle of “bar games” and blackouts. “Last of My Kind” first offers a whiff of retrograde nostalgia (and Paul Cauthen’s Kid Rock-lite cameo does not help), but its unique brand of survivalism ultimately promises a kind of readiness for whatever shall come. It also reads, gloriously, like a Black rejoinder to the dog-whistle paranoia of Hank Williams Jr.’s “A Country Boy Can Survive.” Where I’ve Been ends with “Finally Over,” a bedraggled riff about the battles between perseverance and forfeiture, self-doubt and belief, heaven and hell. Is this album, he seems to wonder, his music-industry exit, the last gasp of the label deals? This is terra firma for country, where the paradox of rural folk seeking big-city fame has long created compelling existential tension. It’s astonishing that he wondered aloud on this track if he should sell his soul for “another viral moment” just before “A Bar Song” soon made him very famous. But this, thankfully, is the work of someone with more to give than a mere viral moment. Rooted in the past but keyed to the idea of finding a better future by whatever means necessary (leaving, burning, boozing, fighting), Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going epitomizes not a one-hit wonder but a songwriter who has found both his mode and his moment at the exact same time.

Mavi,Shadowbox,8.0,Rap,"Sometimes, a glimpse of your reflection in a mirror can feel as disorienting as a dolly zoom, a jarring flash of presence that pulls you into a dark corner of yourself. Mavi experiences several such moments of revelation on Shadowbox, his howling, heart-rending third album. Each glance sends him spinning off his axis, frantically flailing until he can snag a piece of ground. “I’m So Tired” opens with one of these realizations: “Today my grandmother turn 80/And I’m on three Percocets, I ain’t even ate yet.” Mavi holds his own gaze as though it’s Persephone beckoning seductively from the bottom of the abyss. Synth bass and splashy cymbals cascade around him like a collapsing ceiling, reverb threatening to engulf his pleas for absolution. Mavi’s music can almost feel voyeuristic, as though we’re watching his brain activity from behind a two-way mirror. The Charlotte emcee churns in existential circles, pondering towering concepts like the conflict between fate and free will, or whether identity is innate or constructed. This is painful work; he was only 21 when he released End of the Earth, and he’d already concluded that existence is suffering—you either wallow or you press on. Despite its glowing golden-hour grooves, 2022’s Laughing So Hard, it Hurts was awash in self-doubt, Mavi’s joints aching from trying to keep balance. On Shadowbox, the darkness that licked at the edges of his previous work has nearly overtaken him. As Laughing So Hard, it Hurts propelled him to a new level of stardom, Mavi experienced a spell of personal problems; the substances he hoped would ease his mind dulled his creative drive and aggravated his depression. When he emerged, he started writing unflinchingly about how exhausting it is to untangle a mental health crisis. References to drugs and drink abound; grief and heartache permeate every verse. He remains concerned with many of the same evergreen philosophical questions, but he’s less sure there are any answers to be found. Thankfully, Shadowbox never buckles under the weight of its overcast themes. It’s as inventive as any Mavi project, near virtuosic in execution. Despite the narcotic cloud surrounding the album’s creation, Mavi’s writing is more impressive than ever: rich with imagery and metaphor and packed with spiraling internal rhymes, but still piercing and direct. The most unsparing passages hit like a fist, like when he says, “I was taking pills while mom was making dinner” on “Tether,” or how he admits, on “Grindstone,” “I claim I’m quitting, it’s been too many tomorrows.” A water motif shows up throughout the first half of the record, sometimes offering salvation through baptism or cleansing, other times promising to envelop Mavi completely. In the past, Mavi’s slippery flow ran in rivulets across the percussion, sometimes sliding off the end of a bar. He still raps in thick, elliptical patterns on Shadowbox but hews closer to each track’s rhythmic center as if steadying himself on a guardrail. On some songs, his signature sing-songy lilt is more pronounced. The mellifluous delivery disguises the more distressing details of his struggles, but there’s an uneasy edge to it. When the spring in his voice fades, his inflection more directly announces the theme, which helps decipher his densely constructed verses. He’s anxious and insistent on “I Did,” his voice projecting from the back of his throat, seconds away from cracking. On “Too Much to Zelle,” he croaks out a teetering triplet flow that gets raspier as the track continues, his energy and hope rapidly depleting. When he admits that it “took all [he] could muster to mutter help,” he sounds drained, the blooming oasis in sight but still out of reach. The resplendent production serves as a counterweight to the album’s grim subject matter. The beats are moody but melodic, keeping time with soft drums or a pulsing bassline. Gone is the lo-fi grime Mavi used to gravitate toward, replaced with a vaporous chill that settles around his vocals like an autumn rain. There are floating ambient synths—like the twinkling second half of Psymun’s “Open Waters” or lopsided oscillations of Alexander Spit’s “Tether”—and resonant pianos, like the chords that ring into infinity on “The Giver.” “Latch,” one of the strongest tracks, is a slab of Shuggie Otis-style psych-funk, replete with chiming guitar and celestial vocal harmonies. The beats are gorgeous and kaleidoscopic; the bright palette suggests not all is lost, that hope glimmers out there in the distance. It’s tough to find a discernible redemption arc, though. The closest Shadowbox comes to a feeling of catharsis is in the coda of “My Own Way,” when Mavi stops rapping and producer Monte Booker brings in hard-hitting drums for a full minute. But as the track trudges along and Mavi whisper-sings, “You know I’m gonna pray,” the beat gets increasingly distorted, as if it’s a damaged cassette tape disintegrating in the deck. Perhaps Mavi doesn’t believe in clean resolutions, acknowledging that life’s a complicated collage of overlapping experiences. You persevere because you must.",0,"August 13, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mavi-shadowbox/
Fishmans,Long Season,9.3,Rock,"The prospect of making an album with only one gargantuan song was one of those tossed-off comments that seemed like a joke. But when Shinji Sato put forth the idea, he was following a trajectory that defined his life: dream big, and see it through to completion. Long Season, the 1996 magnum opus of Japanese rock band Fishmans, was a radical proposition: take an existing track—the group’s six-minute single “Season”—and turn it into a dreamlike suite that elevates their gentle psych-pop to symphonic proportions. “When we made [Something in the Air], I hated having each song separated from the next,” Sato said of their previous full-length. “Why not just make it one song?” No longer bound by single-digit runtimes, the band crafted a record that was massive in scope but suffused with everyday warmth. A mesmerizing piano motif and rocksteady bassline set the foundation while Sato’s bright and guileless voice floats above. He sounds friendly, like an affectionate drunk filling a room with positive energy, playfully stretching syllables and delivering them with easygoing charm. When he doesn’t sing, the rest of the instrumentation gets to breathe, expand, and sometimes go haywire. Crucially, Long Season does not sound like a jam session; each passage is a self-contained world of sound that serves the drifting, daydream logic of the overall piece. Sato, Fishmans’ vocalist, guitarist, and charismatic leader, showed signs of the sort of ambition and tenacity needed to pull off a grand-scale project like Long Season from a young age. He was already a known presence at Meiji Gakuin University’s Song Writes Club when drummer Kin-ichi Motegi attended an event for new students. Motegi was stunned: “From the moment he started singing, [Sato] had an aura on another level.” Soon, the two started jamming together, and in 1987 they started a band, joined eventually by guitarist Kensuke Ojima, keyboardist Hakase-Sun, and bassist Yuzuru Kashiwabara. Considering the sweeping art-pop of their greatest album, Fishmans had something of an inauspicious beginning: They were a reggae band. Japanese artists had been exploring reggae for more than a decade by the early 1990s, but their vocalists had a more professional style than Sato’s scrappy and childlike delivery. Fishmans’ debut, 1991’s Chappie, Don’t Cry, flopped commercially and critically, and a follow-up single, which doubled as the theme for a short-lived television show, didn’t fare much better. One journalist accused the band of having “no reggae soul.” Early in his career, Sato had written down his goals, many of which involved success in the music business and his social life. He wanted money, he wanted people to hear his songs, he wanted popularity with girls. After their debut LP and early singles failed to make them stars, Sato and the rest of the band began to lose their faith in the industry. Fishmans had to make a decision: Would they focus on more TV tie-ins to help with sales, or pursue artistic freedom? They agreed on the latter. Suddenly, Sato had a new direction in life. “I don’t want to make it big,” he wrote in his journal. “Media interferes with creative activities. There’s a lot we should be doing in the Japanese music scene.” Over their next several albums, Fishmans came into their own, balancing pop appeal with daring studio experiments, and eventually arriving at the wide-ranging approach to genre—dub, psychedelia, lounge, funk, jangle—that defined the Tokyo scene now known as Shibuya-kei. As Fishmans became more musically ambitious, Sato became a more demanding leader. The band, which still wasn’t making much money, began losing members. Ojima departed after 1993’s Neo Yankees’ Holiday, and Hakase after the following year’s Orange, both feeling overwhelmed by Sato’s exacting style. Things began to turn in 1995 when they signed to Polydor, which agreed to finance a private studio for the band in exchange for three new albums in two years, a much faster pace than the band was used to. The combination of pressure and space to work was a fruitful one: The three studio albums Fishmans released on Polydor, including Long Season, were the best of their career. “That album was a work that expressed one world with eight songs,” drummer Motegi once said of 1996’s Something in the Air, the first of Fishmans’ Polydor albums. “So we thought that we could express the world of eight songs with just one.” Sato suggested expanding upon “Season,” a 1996 single already filled with ideas: There’s a lush string arrangement from new member Honzi, record scratching, homey organ chords, and two passages where Sato coos like a baby bird. Sato had only recently gotten his driver’s license, and was taking lyrical inspiration from riding around town. He sings about traveling from one end of Tokyo to the other, feeling happy but lonely, being in a dream state but also dazed by cold medication. He paints these images in relatable terms, highlighting the richness and peculiarities of simply existing. It was the perfect song to transform into an album-length composition. Long Season begins with what sounds like a stone plunging into water, a familiar noise that anticipates the record’s immersive atmosphere. The song’s first section is built on a slowly grooving bassline and repeating piano arpeggios, a hypnotic swell with intermittent flourishes: music box, violin, moody synthesizer. After four minutes—and the brief but thrilling fakeout of a drum fill—the backbeat and vocals finally arrive. There are melodic yelps and wails, soft moments of storytelling and inquisitive questioning. “What is that song you’re humming?” he asks in a disarming moment of genuine interest. To hear it in a song whose world so gently opens up to you feels like the precursor to a heart-to-heart. Sato wanted to capture the “flow of time in our mind” and how, for example, we may “suddenly [remember] something from 15 years ago.” Take the unexpected introduction of harmonized vocals eight minutes in. It sounds like a children’s choir singing in the distance, and as it slowly fades away, a music box starts twinkling to transport us further into the past. The album continually evolves in this way, gliding from one scene to the next. At one point, Sato keeps singing “driving…” as Motegi plays a drum roll. It has the quietly cinematic energy of a road trip. The repetition serves both as a conduit for fond remembrance and a reminder to keep moving. Sato wrote most of Fishmans’ songs and the rest of the band actualized his ideas. He had high standards, but didn’t want to give specific instructions for what the other members should do. This dynamic was especially significant for Long Season, which features numerous guest musicians: singers like UA and MariMari, guitarist Taiji Sato, and percussionist Asa-Chang. The latter contributes a long passage of improvised tabla played alongside other percussive noises, including Motegi’s drums; the two instruments are meant to sound like they’re fighting one another. Long Season was composed with these kinds of abstract directions; for example, Sato wrote that he wanted the song to have a “sunset scene.” The guests who recorded their contributions didn’t quite know how their parts would fit into the larger composition, which was stitched together from four different sections. Sound engineer ZAK was especially dedicated to ensuring the final product was unimpeachable. He was the one who suggested the water sounds, which dot the album during its improvisatory percussion sequence. His presence is also there in the track’s coherency. Around 21 minutes in, the familiar strains of guitar strums provide slow preparation for the intro’s reprise. Reverse tape effects symbolize this return, and when Kashiwabara’s bassline swoops in, it sounds like we’ve snapped back to reality. Sato wanted each live performance of Long Season to be unique. During Fishmans’ December 1996 concert at Akasaka Blitz, the band members sound like they’re trading off solos during Long Season, from guitar to drums to steelpan. The piece is more stripped-down than the studio version, and its minimalist bent allows for a deeper appreciation for each individual instrument. Two years later, Fishmans performed an affecting rendition of the track at the same venue. Two-thirds of the way in, vocalists start happily chanting “Get round in the season!” as if encouraging the audience to cherish this moment. Shortly after, everyone drops out of the song except for Sato. He strums his guitar and sings in a moment of intimacy: “The two of us driving at dusk… halfway dreaming.” When the band enters again, everything feels a little more magical. That 1998 concert was Sato’s last. He had escalating respiratory problems, and used oxygen sprays throughout the tour. Less than three months after this show, he passed away at the age of 33. “You don’t have to make compromises in your work, but it is important to be grateful and humble,” he said in his final months. Sato never got to witness the growing popularity of his band—their songs have millions of plays on streaming services, and last year, the surviving members of Fishmans staged the Long Season 2023 tour. In the ’90s, Sato didn’t believe that people would understand his music, and knew some would be turned off by Long Season’s length. Still, he pressed forward. “I believe I’m making music that can change somebody’s life,” he once said. “I’ll keep doing my best so it reaches that someone.” Ultimately, Sato saw himself as an ordinary person and amateur musician. “I’m not a good guitar player,” he confessed, “but Fishmans’ songs need my guitar, so I play.” His singing made that devotion even clearer. Throughout Long Season, his voice is filled with a whimsical curiosity, and a freedom to intone in whatever manner he finds appropriate. At its best, his singing sounds like the natural overflow of being swept up by the music. This intuitive quality is imperative to how, despite its demanding length, Long Season is a comforting listen—it is never too academic or outré, and its pleasures are always within reach. It mirrors the way that Sato understood life: as a dream you can create and get lost inside.",0,"May 12, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fishmans-long-season/
Dua Lipa,Radical Optimism,6.6,Pop/R&B,"Dua Lipa is a pop star who stridently resists personal disclosure in her work. This added an irresistible biographical quirk to “Houdini,” the hard-edged, darting lead single of her third album. As she often does, Lipa was challenging a guy to impress her before she gave him the slip. Lipa herself is an elusive presence, which isn’t to say she’s reclusive. Although it’s been four years since her second album Future Nostalgia, the British Albanian-Kosovar 28-year-old has remained omnipresent thanks to various luxury brand campaigns and the contractually attendant magazine covers, roles in Barbie and Argylle, her podcast and book club, and the album’s pandemic-delayed tour. Despite that visibility, she appears glamorous, distant. It’s quite admirable that she refuses to trade on her private life for intrigue, especially when celebrity subtext has never been a more powerful driver of pop success. At the same time, it’s hard to decipher what she stands for as an artist, and harder than ever on the confused Radical Optimism. Lipa’s 2017 self-titled album was the sound of a young pop star coming into focus. A long-gestating grab-bag of thrusting nightclub staples seared by her white-hot burn of a voice, it finally took flight when the sisterly video for “New Rules” turned an album track into a whopping hit (and seemingly just in the nick of time to avoid being sent to guest-vocalist purgatory). It bought her the right to become an artiste on the focused Future Nostalgia, which transmuted the sounds of Lipa’s ’90s youth, the playfulness of the Spice Girls and the funkiness of Jamiroquai, into weightless disco reverie. Hers was the first major lockdown promotional campaign, and you wonder whether COVID curbed the lifespan of these lusty bops by depriving them of their natural dancefloor dominion, or in fact cultivated it, giving them a lasting power no marketing team could have dreamt of. Going by the curiously opaque, even defensive press that led into Radical Optimism, you begin to suspect the pandemic did a fair bit of the heavy lifting. Of her new album, Lipa, er, divulged to Time recently, “I’m just a different person, so of course this record is going to be different. I have different thoughts, wants, needs, and perspectives.” Go girl, give us something? She’s bristled at the entirely accurate notion that “Houdini” has anything to do with disco; elsewhere in the promotional word salad, she has spoken frequently of the inspiration of Britpop and the energy and experimentation she hears in the likes of Primal Scream and Oasis. But listening to Radical Optimism with Britpop in mind might recall the Arrested Development bit in which Michael Bluth is forced to ask, “Has anyone in this family ever seen a chicken?” Of course, despite Lipa’s well-touted business acumen (her own production and management company; media-empire ambitions), it’s not her job to boil Radical Optimism down to the elevator pitch. So what is it? The album opens with a sensual invitation in “End of an Era,” a psychedelic, Avalanches-style candyland about kisses driving you mad that sounds convincingly lightheaded—but it then leaves Oz never to return. For all the Britpop chatter, it’s actually a strikingly European-sounding record, for good and bad, made primarily with Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, Danny L Harle, “New Rules” co-writer Caroline Ailin, and Tobias Jesso Jr. In that Time interview, Lipa said that as far back as her debut, she hoped she would one day be “deserving” enough to get in a room with Parker. Before you ask, she did manifest it—but more important is what you do once you get there. Considering the pedigree of its personnel, Radical Optimism is oddly incoherent. The absence of Future Nostalgia’s many topline writers is notable both in the lack of ironclad melodies and unfamiliarity with how to handle Lipa’s vocal weaponry. This results in leaden thumpers like the bell-ringing Euro-pop of “Illusion,” in which Lipa taunts some other sap who thinks he can outmaneuver her. It climaxes in a primary-colored synth burble: filter house stripped of the filter, French touch gone heavy-handed. A handful of songs reach for ABBA’s wounded-but-persistent pride and golden songcraft: “Training Season” has the vigor of a “Lay All Your Love on Me” or “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!”; “These Walls” the bittersweet valediction of “The Winner Takes It All.” But as with much of Radical Optimism, both songs are brutally overstuffed and desperately in need of breathing space. Parker (absent on the latter) has a taste for clutter, the rhythm section always firing like pistons, and the too-vigorous effort grounds Lipa’s gift for airborne fantasia. A few songs even wade into Eurovision-worthy schlager. “Happy for You” welds a vulnerable sentiment about Lipa’s benevolence towards her ex and his new girlfriend (“She’s really pret-ty/I think she’s a model”) to a gaping, cavernous breakbeat that provides a strange big-tent conclusion to an album with an otherwise busy affect. Similarly, “Falling Forever,” which swaps Parker for the other “New Rules” co-writers Ian Kirkpatrick and Emily Warren, is a bizarre assault, with Lipa yodeling “how loooooooooong” against galloping drums. Both are almost as odd and awkward as anything off Rina Sawayama’s Hold the Girl, as individual songwriting choices and within the context of the album—although I wouldn’t be surprised if they were written with the climactic fireworks of her impending headline set at Glastonbury in mind. It’s not that Lipa and her collaborators can’t make unusual sound clashes work. Two standout songs are elegantly odd, as uncanny yet comforting as the memory of that one foreign radio hit that dominated a great holiday. The understated “French Exit” splices a Café del Mar acoustic guitar refrain amid skittish flute runs and conversational verses, and climaxes in a sophisticated, string-laden kiss-off and one of the album’s best choruses. (Lipa has a taste for spoken-word interstitials in her stiffest R.P., but her almost mournful “filer à l’Anglaise” finishes the song like a drop of good olive oil.) And “Maria” ditches Parker, brings in Andrew Wyatt and Julia Michaels, and makes especially good on Harle’s involvement. He co-produced Caroline Polachek’s Pang and Desire, I Want to Turn Into You; the latter did bravura things with the influence of British and continental pop from the early 2000s. “Maria” dabbles in the pacy acoustica of French DJ Bob Sinclair’s “Love Generation” and Alizée’s “Moi… Lolita” as Lipa sings a paean to her lover’s ex for making him the man he is today. “Faintly Sapphic fixation with the other woman” is a well-worn pop trope by this point, but the force of Lipa’s cries in the chorus—“Maria!/I know you’re gone/But I feel ya/When we’re alone”—resounds with a curiosity and emotional richness that’s all but absent elsewhere. To hear Lipa talk about Radical Optimism is to hear her talk about weathering chaos gracefully; or as the cover puts it very literally, keeping your cool while swimming in shark-infested waters. But most of the lyrics are about dodging depth rather than diving in: outsmarting advances, clean breaks, clean hands, no mess. The lover-on-the-lam vibe belies the sentiment of “Anything for Love,” a scrap of a song that mines Janet Jackson at her sweetest as Lipa laments a time when “we used to do anything for love”—a romantic notion not particularly in evidence here. Similarly, the half-baked lyrical conceit and unconvincingly winsome tone of “These Walls”—as in, “If these walls could talk, they’d tell us to break up”—positively shrugs as a relationship meets its death knell. The Cher cosplay of “Whatcha Doing” is another inadvertent reveal: Late at night, Lipa debates making her move on a guy she likes but worries about ceding her power. “If control is my religion,” she sings, somewhat mixing her metaphors, “then I’m heading for collision.” She decides against the approach, able to imagine them together in the future but not right now. It’s telling: The overthought Radical Optimism puts Lipa so many steps ahead she’s hard to make out. Her tight grip reveals an empty hand.

Gunna,One of Wun,5.7,Rap,"Let’s be real: You knew what One of Wun sounded like before you pressed play. Gunna’s motor-mouthed tales of the high life here, his dreary piano ballads there. His last album a Gift & a Curse wasn’t a whole lot different; neither was the one before that. Glazed, melodic raps about clothes and girls and whatever jewelry he wore to the studio that day are Gunna’s bread and butter. That is the formula that has made him one of the biggest Atlanta rappers of the last decade. Though these days it feels like even Gunna is getting bored, spicing it up risks derailing the money train. Despite his considerable success, in the last two years Gunna has been unofficially shunned from the inner circles of popular rap by hip-hop cornballs who have interpreted his plea deal in the YSL RICO case as “snitching.” (Kendrick recently made him the butt of the joke on his Drake diss “Euphoria” when he said, “I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint.”) The situation hangs over One of Wun, clearly weighing on Gunna even as he tiptoes around those frustrations to keep the good vibes intact. He’s trying to have the best of both worlds: An ol’ fashioned light and fun Gunna flex-a-thon, sprinkled with a reflective bar or wistful tune every now and then. Tonally, it’s confusing. Nobody wants Gunna’s pain rap album or his Me Against the World, but I do want him to be real with us. Back in the day, when Gunna sung about the way his “Fear of God pants match his Fear of God Vans” on Drip Season 3’s “Almighty,” or his “AP blacker than Akon” on WUNNA’s eponymous track, he sounded as if nothing else in the world mattered to him more. Now his boasts of having the sharpest outfit at the Met Gala (“One of Wun”) or a new Balenciaga crop top (“Prada Dem”) feel obligatory. I don’t doubt that he still gets fits off regularly, but we all know he has so much more at the top of his mind. It comes off as a deflection. He’s making songs that sound like catchy Gunna songs of the past—he’s still able to float on these laid-back, skittering ATL trap variants while reading straight off his SSENSE receipt—but they don’t feel like them. He’s going through the motions. His rapidfire flow on “Hakuna Matata” is clean but the energy is flat (he should have saved it for the soundtrack of Barry Jenkins’ upcoming Mufasa movie). He’s made “On One Tonight,” with its humming beat and limp croons, a dozen times before. I do still get a kick out of his latest sexual escapades (at the gym, on a yacht, in an orgy) and luxury car purchases—the extremely chill “Back in the A” is a standout, especially when he says, “My car is a half million dollars/I came a long way from Impalas”—but he’s so checked out that a couple of vivid bars can’t hide that he’s wearing a mask. Tucked away at the back of the 20-track album are some signs that Gunna is figuring out how to address his disenchantment without losing his spark. There you’ll find a few slower, piano-driven ballads (“Life’s Changing,” “Conscience,” and “Today I Did Good”) that probably won’t be chart-toppers but go deeper than surface level. The mood he captures is that of someone who has spent months on the couch devouring cheese puffs and binging sitcoms after a breakup until suddenly reaching an emotional breakthrough. The revelation comes in the form of lots of talk about self-care and working out (“I ain’t been eatin’ no bullshit/And fitness, I wake up, I feel fit,” he croons on “Today I Did Good”), which is admittedly not the easiest stuff to make interesting in a rap song, but it’s his way of acknowledging that public ostracization from hip-hop has beaten him down, and that he’s come out on the other side stronger. On “Collage,” he manages to work in his lifestyle changes in the most Gunna way possible: “I spend 50 racks on a trainer/My payroll ain’t missin’ a payment.” This all may turn into him sing-rapping about an Erewhon smoothie on his next album, but you know what, at least it will be honest.",0,"May 15, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gunna-one-of-wun/
Travis Scott,Days Before Rodeo,7.7,Rap,"In the dwindling months of summer 2014, Travis Scott’s obsession with curation began to take shape in the public eye. A few days before his mixtape Days Before Rodeo (a teaser for his official debut, Rodeo) hit SoundCloud on August 18, Metro Boomin posted a behind-the-scenes video chronicling the making of Travis and Young Thug’s song “Skyfall.” Between frenetic camera cuts, you’re treated to shots of Travis and Metro piecing together “Skyfall” as smoke billows in the background. Scott bounces between playful exuberance and meticulous micromanagement, imploring engineer Alex Tumay to remove drums and adjust bass levels, all under the watchful eye of the camera. It’s not unreasonable to think of Days Before Rodeo as the linchpin for Travis Scott’s massive success. He wanted to be a star; if his next move had been a misfire, he might have had to settle for a spot in the middle of the pack. The 10-year anniversary deluxe edition of Days Before Rodeo, available on streaming and vinyl for the first time in a decade with a slew of new tracks, is a time capsule of Scott’s chameleonic production prowess and his budding curatorial skill, even as it begins to reveal the penchant for vapid spectacle that would lead him astray. By the time Scott’s buzzy 2013 debut mixtape Owl Pharaoh arrived, his career felt as though it just needed one final push to get over the hump. He’d already secured co-signs from Kanye West and T.I., earning touted placements as an in-house producer for G.O.O.D. Music (credits on Yeezus’ “Guilt Trip” and “New Slaves,” with lingering speculation that Scott was a catalyst behind the album’s angsty tonal shift). He lent his talents to Jay-Z’s Magna Carta, Holy Grail and Wale’s The Gifted. By virtue of association, Scott had strapped on the proverbial jetpack. Those simmering expectations boil over on the growled refrain of Days Before Rodeo opener “The Prayer”: “I might fuck ’round lose my mind, I gotta break out,” he raps, making the act of saying grace sound more like a warning shot. Compared to later releases, Days Before Rodeo is an exercise in restraint, lacking an extensive list of lyrical features (but full of production assists from FKi 1st, Metro Boomin, and Lex Luger). Still, the tape hits clear highs when Scott rolls out the red carpet for more capable rappers. The marriage between blistering hi-hats and spaghetti Western samples make “Mamacita” feel as though Young Thug and the late Rich Homie Quan are gallivanting through a gunfight at the O.K. Corral, with Scott trailing behind. “Skyfall” sets up a brilliant contrast between Scott’s baritone hums and Thug’s piercing raps, coming off as a slow march to desolation accompanied by play-by-play from vengeful spirits. “Sloppy Toppy,” a spiritual precursor to epic Rodeo collaborations “3500” and “Nightcrawler,” remains the platonic ideal for when Scott’s grand plans come together. Teeing it off with an expertly chopped 1977 Edna Wright sample (produced by FKi 1st and Mike Dean), Scott assembles Migos and Peewee Longway, some of the era’s greatest Atlanta rappers, for a deliriously raunchy joyride that always seems on the verge of veering off the cliff. It’s a posse cut that wouldn’t have sounded out of place on Migos’ No Label II. Here, Scott is more akin to the coach of the Showtime Lakers, tasked only with bridging the gap, pushing the right buttons to position more talented lyricists to succeed. He doesn’t always need help from guests: On “Drugs You Should Try It,” arguably the mixtape’s summit, Scott embarks on his version of an emotive ballad, yearning for the numbing effects of substances over FKi 1st’s murky, downtempo production. “I try it if it feels right/This feels nice/I’ve been down and lost for days/Glad I found you on the way,” his raps, his distorted voice eking it way out over the lush guitar composition. The words feel raw, even though he isn’t saying much—a balance that’s a lot easier to strike as a regular guy than it is as a larger-than-life superstar. But the longer stretches where Scott flies solo on Days Before Rodeo were early evidence that, as a rapper, he generally shouldn’t be left to his own devices. If it weren’t for the intoxicating thrill ride “Backyard,” where his vocals turn the track from a party into a rager, the second half of the project would feel like a slog through harmless, sophomoric boasts. Already on Days Before Rodeo, it feels like Scott is more focused on executing big swings than he is in the more tedious process of coming up with important or interesting things to say. The new edition’s five bonus tracks—all previously unreleased cuts from that era—aren’t appointment viewing. “Yeah Yeah” is a welcome chance to experience another wildly fun Thug appearance; otherwise, it’s strictly fan service. Perhaps while revisiting Days Before Rodeo, your attention returned to that “Skyfall” behind-the-scenes video. It’s astounding that the clip exists, a mythical shot that almost morphs into a self-fulfilling prophecy of Scott’s trip to the stratosphere. It’s representative of the rapper’s ongoing obsession with creating a ubiquitous moment in pop culture, a historic clip that makes fans imagine that they “had to be there.” Days Before Rodeo wasn’t played off phone speakers in high-school hallways and dingy frat basements solely because it was stocked with bangers and true hits. The tape found its audience because Scott’s evident hunger inspired its own kind of FOMO: The bandwagon had arrived. Could you jump on before it was too late?",0,"September 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/travis-scott-days-before-rodeo/
Iron & Wine,Light Verse,7.7,Folk/Country,"How do you measure the time between albums? The calendar says that Iron & Wine’s latest studio effort, Light Verses, arrives exactly six years, eight months, and one day after its previous one, 2017’s Beast Epic. Your record shelf, on the other hand, says it’s been two EPs, one Archive Series release, one collab with Calexico, one reissue of his breakthrough album, two live albums, and a documentary. Maybe it’s more useful to tally up all the mundane moments when you’ve tried to be a good partner or patient father or productive artist or engaged citizen—tasks all complicated by a global pandemic that, for Sam Beam, anyway, proved creatively crippling. These various metrics are all bouncing around his skull on Light Verse, an album very much aware of time passing. Beam’s own abacus can be startlingly gruesome: “Time likes pulling my teeth,” he sings on the wry, spry “Cutting It Close.” “I never knew how many teeth I would need.” All of those yanked molars add up to a new perspective on pretty much everything. Beam reemerges on Light Verse with a dry sense of humor and a newfound ability to laugh off certain tragedies, like death—both others’ and your own—precisely because they are inevitable. Even back on Iron & Wine’s relatively lo-fi 2002 debut, The Creek Drank the Cradle, he had a flair for dressing up bleak truths in warm melodies and reassuringly measured vocals, not only making them palatable but finding beauty in sorrow. Beam can still pull off that sleight of hand gracefully enough to make the title Light Verse sound queasily ironic, but now he’s looking backwards over 49 years. These new songs are about tracing your steps, taking stock, and raising a glass to lovers and friends who pass through your life only briefly. He spends much of the album wondering about people’s whereabouts: “I knew someone long ago, whether I wanted to or not,” he sings on the stark “Taken by Surprise.” “We never said goodbye that I remember.” That person didn’t stay long, but it was enough to provoke gratitude half a lifetime later. The new outlook of middle age animates these songs and allows Beam to tinker with tone and form. Light Verse is a lively, relatively breezy album, despite its somber subject matter. He worked with a new crew of musicians, including bassist Sebastian Steinberg and multi-instrumentalist Davíd Garza, who make sure their flourishes never distract from the pith of his songs. “Sweet Talk” has the bouncy pomp of ’60s bubblegum psych, which feels new for Beam, and “Yellow Jacket” builds so patiently that it sounds epic despite clocking in at a mere three and a half minutes. “All in Good Time,” a duet with Fiona Apple, surveys the full arc of a relationship as they repeat the title like a mantra and milk it of every possible implication. “All in good time my angel came back/Made us some money but that didn’t last,” he sings to her. “All in good time and that’s what it was/Mistook that cash in the mattress for love,” she sings back. The imagery becomes outlandish, and it’s fun to think of Apple and Beam holding up banks and stealing cars, but a distinct melancholy underscores each note. Even the good times will end eventually. That idea gestures toward the bittersweet irony of this fine late-career album: All the years have pulled Beam’s teeth, but they have also sharpened his pen.

Raphael Rogiński,Plays John Coltrane and Langston Hughes,8.5,Experimental,"At Kraków’s Unsound festival last year, Raphael Rogiński was slated to perform material from Žaltys, an upcoming album he had recorded for the festival’s in-house label. Yet as the Polish guitarist played, Unsound director Mat Schulz became perplexed; he didn’t recognize any of the riffs spilling like unpolished gemstones from Rogiński’s guitar. Backstage after the show, Schulz asked why he’d skipped the scheduled repertoire. “But I played all those songs,” Rogiński protested. “I just changed them.” Anyone approaching Rogiński’s newly reissued 2015 album Plays John Coltrane and Langston Hughes for the first time may feel a similar sense of confusion: The tracklist is dedicated almost exclusively to Coltrane compositions, yet it would take an Olympic leap of imagination to locate the jaunty strut of “Blue Train” in the patient contemplation of Rogiński’s version, which tumbles like fallen leaves, or the bold, doleful bellow of “Seraphic Light” in the halting cadences of the guitarist’s rendition. Some songs seem to share only a common key signature with their inspirations; in some cases, even that tonal connection is as tenuous as spider’s silk. To those familiar with the cryptic, mutable melodies of Rogiński’s later albums, like Talàn and Žaltys, these pieces sound mostly like dispatches from the guitarist’s own secretive imagination. Over the past decade and a half, Rogiński has developed a singular and unmistakable style of solo electric guitar. His playing is spare, yet his fingerpicking can make it sound like there are four hands working in tandem; it can be hard to believe that there are no overdubs. His harmonic sensibility reminds me of a garden in early fall, when everything has gone to seed and once-verdant vines slouch toward decay. His melodies are ruminative and searching—doubling back on understated themes, applying minor ornaments or spontaneous variations to two-and three-note patterns—as though he were looking for something he’d lost, or trying to tease out an idea stuck on the tip of his tongue. Plays John Coltrane and Langston Hughes, originally released on CD on Warsaw’s Bolt Records and never before available on vinyl or streaming, was Rogiński’s first major solo statement. Over the past nine years, this hushed, hypnotic suite of koan-like pieces has gathered a cult fan base. Reissued now in the shadow of last year’s Talàn and this year’s Žaltys, Plays John Coltrane feels of a piece with them, almost like the first installment of a trilogy. Yet it also stands alone, a perfect encapsulation of his music’s mystical, spiritual energies. Each track springs from the same well of nameless sadness, channeling an ancient, ancestral current of longing. Hints of Rogiński’s source material occasionally peek through the penumbral mood. The ghost of Coltrane’s “Equinox” moves fitfully through the guitarist’s cover, flickering in the occasional flash of a minor third; the roller-coaster blues of “Mr. P.C.” is rendered in notes that float like soap bubbles, fat and wobbly and slow, splashing rainbows wherever they land. The heartbreaking “Naima” is the album’s most faithful interpretation, its rising and falling lead mapped precisely to Coltrane’s score, as though acknowledging the purity, even perfection, of the ballad’s reverent melody. But by and large, the heads of these songs become, in Rogiński’s interpretations, stealthy hydras, twisting wildly in slow motion. Just two songs are credited as Rogiński originals: “Walkers With the Dawn” and “Rivers,” both settings for lyrics adapted from Langston Hughes, the pioneering Harlem Renaissance poet, and featuring the plaintive voice of Polish singer Natalia Przybysz. Half whisper and half moan, her voice is weary and fraying at the edges, a dry stalk framed against Rogiński’s puddles of tone. Both songs are standouts: They break the meditative spell of the album’s instrumentals and open up a mournful new dimension, giving voice to the melancholy at the heart of Rogiński’s music. It would be understandable to entertain some measure of skepticism about some of Rogiński’s borrowings. Who is he, a white European, to invoke Hughes’ “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” a poem rooted in the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow and the hope of the Great Migration? But the poem’s geological time scale—“I’ve known rivers/I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in my veins/My soul has grown deep like the rivers”—articulates a broad metaphysical sweep inherent in all of Rogiński’s music. As the child of a Holocaust survivor, he is keenly attuned to the way trauma leaves its mark, generations down the line. In his fascination with Jewish mysticism, Tatar folklore, and all the cultures that have crisscrossed Central and Eastern Europe and Western Asia over thousands of years, Rogiński is a cataloger and reviver of folk traditions, an archaeologist looking for traces of living spirit in battered instruments and half-forgotten refrains. In invoking Hughes and Coltrane, I see Rogiński as neither appropriative nor extractive, much less fetishistic, but regenerative: drawing upon the supernatural force of those artists’ work as sustenance. Four newly recorded songs, all credited as reinterpretations of Coltrane pieces, round out the reissue. “Pursuance” is seemingly inspired by part three of A Love Supreme, and “Promise” might spring from “The Promise,” from 1964’s Live at Birdland, but it’s unclear which works “Spirituals” and “Love” are drawn from. That doesn’t really matter; what’s most notable is how faithfully Rogiński has recreated the sound and mood of his album’s original recordings, nine years later. The muted glow of his guitar and the dusky room tone are identical, and his use of empty space is just as thoughtful. If anything, his playing on these new tracks is even more spare, as if in the past nine years Rogiński had distilled the spirit of Coltrane’s music—or, at least, the spirit as it moves through him—into an even more concentrated essence. Far from mere bonus cuts, these four final songs feel like an essential coda, an enlightening new afterword to Rogiński’s masterpiece.",1,"October 3, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/raphael-roginski-plays-john-coltrane-and-langston-hughes/
The Softies,The Bed I Made,8.0,Rock,"In the world of the Softies, to crush is to live. Their songs are pop miniatures where the spectrum of human feeling seems to ripple outward from the bittersweet ache of liking a person so much that your mind is pulled obsessively in one direction, however momentarily. Maybe it is Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia’s 30-year friendship and indelible, world-of-its-own musical chemistry—two plainspoken voices, two sparkling guitars, and space—that helps communicate that intimacy so effectively. From the initial notes of The Bed I Made, the Softies’ fourth album and first in 24 years, their harmonies have never glowed brighter, and it’s chilling. “I’m drifting at sea without you,” they sing in unison on “Go Back in Time.” But they’ve found their best anchor again. The Softies are indie-pop legends. From the pre-internet era of fanzines and snail mail on, Melberg’s early California punk bands Tiger Trap and Go Sailor have become talismanic for lovers of DIY pop, earnest emotion, and scrappy minimalism. Tiger Trap started when Melberg was still in high school—her first onstage performance ever was an impromptu song during the legendary International Pop Underground Convention—releasing a sole 1993 LP on K Records and opening for the likes of Fugazi and Beat Happening. The endless succession of raw hooks on songs like “Puzzle Pieces” and “Super Crush” set the vulnerability and Everly Brothers wonder of Melberg’s future projects (and earned her major-label interest—maybe the same ones chasing Jawbreaker?—which the band declined). Sbragia, meanwhile, was a former metal guitarist and Tiger Trap fan who got to know Melberg through letters. Embracing simplicity and oddity, the Softies floated on jazzy chords and negative space that could be incandescent like the Marine Girls or coolly complex like Australia’s the Cat’s Miaow. Their entwined dynamic was so tightly woven that songs about their platonic friendship still sound like romance: “I can’t love you the way he does, I can only love you more,” Melberg sings to her bandmate on their 1995 debut, It’s Love. The Bed I Made is a lovely introduction to their orbit. The Softies render teen-spirited drama with adult equanimity, just as they convey adult emotions with the possibilities and freedom of youth. “At this point in my life, I have experienced more loss,” Sbragia noted in a recent interview. “But crushes not working out is my favorite songwriting topic, apparently.” Emotional maturity shines through these twilight songs about smartly exiting doomed romantic situations rather than untangling them, about self-possession and having the conviction to speak your mind. “How could I know how to fall out of love?” Melberg sings in her angelic soprano on “I Said What I Said.” “You were kind and fair/You can’t fake feelings that aren’t there,” she reasons on “California Highway 99,” but she still gets away as fast as possible. The negative space of Softies songs has always made them feel viscerally sadder—as if representing the void of the dejection—but here it also makes tiny notes feel bigger and brighter, illuminating the moments when harmonies crash perfectly together in clarity and camaraderie. In the years since the Softies’ last album, Melberg played in bands like Brave Irene and Knife Pleats, but also dug deeper into her work as a singer-songwriter—releasing incredible, open-hearted records like 2006’s Cast Away the Clouds and 2009’s Homemade Ship, which had more in common with the melodic finesse of the Softies’ one-time tourmate Elliott Smith than Bay Area punk. The candor of her voice and unvarnished language became elemental, its own indie-pop vernacular. Melberg always seems to speak the language of mixtapes, the kind you make with a message: pinpointing precise feelings and stating them so directly and unmistakably that it might feel a little scary. On these new Softies songs, the storytelling is often richer and more visual, too—pink skies and a rose garden serve as markers of time; an old house’s quirks become solid—even when the lyrics are spartan. “Headphones” captures the duo’s daydream essence with the brevity of a Yoko Ono Grapefruit instruction: “Plug your headphones/Straight into my heart/Listen/Listen/I love you.” Many of the songs are in fact about songs themselves, how “country radio reminded me that you and I weren’t meant to be,” or how “every song is just a sigh, a little moment going by, a puff of smoke, a waterfall, a long-distance call.” As ever, an indie-pop song amplifies shy speech, a link in the chain of communication among introverts. The most beautiful thing about this spare, glimmering music is the assurance and comfort it conveys even when voicing unbearable feelings. The strummed mini-anthem “Tiny Flame” seems to focus microscopically on a relationship that never took flight, but it zooms out too, with guttural girl-group yearning. “It started with a tiny flame/And ended in tears/I hadn’t felt that way in years,” Sbragia sings longingly, anticipating the lingering blow of the rupture. “Baby, when you think of me/Don’t forget/We could have been something.” Those words cut deeper sung from adulthood. But, from the Softies’ wise vantage, there’s also greater strength in a new beginning. “Set a fire, let it burn, and start again,” Sbragia sings, and with help from a friend and a song, she does.

Ryuichi Sakamoto,Opus,7.6,Experimental,"When director Neo Sora was approached by his father, Ryuichi Sakamoto, to direct the concert film that became Ryuichi Sakamoto | Opus, urgency was in the air. Sakamoto and his team knew that the week-long sessions planned for September 2022 might be the last time the 70-year-old composer, whose cancer had recently escalated to stage four, might have the energy to record. But the urgency was not motivated only by a sense of dwindling time. Even though he was so physically weakened that he could perform only a few songs at a time, Sakamoto felt full of ideas and creative energy. Sakamoto drew up new arrangements of some of the most notable songs from his career, prepared three new pieces, and contemplated ways to stage them; he imagined the studio lighting shifting with the daylight over the course of the performances, progressing from early-morning gloom to afternoon sunshine and back to stark twilight. This cyclical motion provides a somber echo of the subtext of the film: All things must end. Opus—the soundtrack to the film—could easily have been a maudlin document of Sakamoto’s final concert, but instead, it feels like a celebration of the irrepressible perseverance of one of popular music’s most steadfast experimenters. Sakamoto spoke occasionally of harboring a perfectionist’s drive. In 2016, after decades of era-defining music across genres and media, he said that he still hoped to one day make a “masterpiece” before he died. He seemed to think of his live performances the same way. “I try to be as close to perfection as possible,” he told The Fader in 2017. One of the most striking things about Opus is the suggestion that he has finally abandoned his perfectionist tendencies. His playing throughout is emotionally resonant and carefully considered, but he eschews showy displays of technical prowess in favor of an intimate depiction of the man behind the piano. The film offers a careful study of Sakamoto’s facial expressions, an occasional grimace cracking his intense focus. In a halting performance of “Bibo no Aozora,” he pauses and restarts the song, searching for the right chords. (That moment from the film doesn’t make it onto the album, where his playing begins tentatively and swiftly grows softly confident.) One of the record’s most affecting moments is its rendition of Yellow Magic Orchestra’s “Tong Poo,” presented in a new arrangement at a slower tempo than usual. In its original 1978 incarnation, the song is a taut collage of splatter-painted synth melodies. But on Opus, it’s deeply human, rendering familiar melodies as an elegiac meditation on the time that’s passed since he first recorded it. Two of the new pieces offer similarly thoughtful looks back, paying tribute to lost friends and collaborators: “BB” honors the director Bernardo Bertolucci and “for Jóhann” is dedicated to the composer Jóhann Jóhannsson. In each, Sakamoto conjures powerful feelings from sparse chords. They’re intense documents of grief and love, made all the more moving knowing that their first recording would also very likely be their last performance. The most stirring moments take place in the margins, like on “Andata”—originally recorded for Sakamoto’s 2017 album async—when the sounds of his breathing whisper over the top of the serpentine piano melodies. Elsewhere, amid the hush, you can hear the movement of the piano’s pedals and his subtly shifting position on the bench. The presence of these sounds makes the recording feel deeply embodied—they offer a sense of kinetic energy being wrung out of him at a time when such expenditure was costly to him. Sakamoto wrote that the month after the filming of Opus, his physical condition worsened and he felt “utterly hollow. Still, in between the chords, he breathes, and for one last time, the melodies spill out of him just as naturally.",0,"August 14, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ryuichi-sakamoto-opus/
Fat Dog,WOOF.,5.7,Rock,"When Fat Dog, the UK’s latest post-punk export, hopped on tour with Viagra Boys last year, they enraged a few fans riding hard for the headliner. “We got a lot of hate from people because they didn’t want to see the support act ‘out-do’ anyone,” Fat Dog frontman Joe Love explained to NME this spring. Fuming that the South London five-piece were punching above their weight, one dissatisfied concertgoer accused Love of being “arrogant,” calling him “a tiny little prick,” as Fat Dog keyboardist Chris Hughes remembered. I’ve never seen Fat Dog live, but their reputation as performers has made its way into every published piece on the band. It’s what attracted their devoted following (who reportedly call themselves “the Kennel”), and landed them a record deal with Domino even before releasing their first single. Loyal to their rabid fanbase, Fat Dog let the Kennel select the initial track they recorded for Domino: a seven-minute thumper called “King of the Slugs” that came out last summer. Like most of the songs on Fat Dog’s debut album, WOOF., “King of the Slugs” is a hybrid strain of hard rock and EDM, blown-out bass and revving synths lurching into tweaked klezmer-techno. Often filtered through reverb, Love’s blunt and grizzled vocals recall bullish forebears like Idles and Fat White Family. In April, Fat Dog played “King of the Slugs” to a packed house at Electric Brixton, a 1,500 capacity venue in South London—the same part of town that’s birthed post-punk revivalists like Shame, Dry Cleaning, and Goat Girl in recent years. Footage from the show captures the crowd pogoing in unison as Love waves a white cowboy hat over them like a rodeo preacher. Behind him, drummer John Hutchinson sweats beneath his rubber dog mask, its jaw agape and tongue spilling out the front. Much fanfare has been made of the costumes and hijinks, and the audience is going batshit—but Love seems a bit joyless and contained, like he doesn’t quite believe in the product he’s peddling. That same sense of detachment is smudged across WOOF., mucking up the surface with its dull, grayish residue. Bemoaning rock’s cerebral turn, Love formed Fat Dog in 2021 with a batch of demos he’d made during lockdown. The band’s mandate: to make fun, ridiculous music. Something people could dance or thrash to. Hughes, Hutchinson, bassist Ben Harris, and woodwind player Morgan Wallace helped shape Love’s source material into zany bruisers with punk heft and club tempos. But despite the flatulent sax bursts and Love’s occasionally jagged howl, WOOF. feels decidedly un-fun, more like a series of cynical decisions looped on repeat. Throughout the album, Fat Dog seem to ask: Wouldn’t it be funny if we put violin, viola, and cello on our kind-of punk album? What if we had a track with Auto-Tune, and one that name-checks the Karate Kid sequel? What if we bookend everything with moody monologues recited by our hype man, character actor Neil Bell? What if electro-polka? What if clarinet? It all carries the whiff of staged eccentricity. The songs are too long and often repeat large slabs of lyrics to no memorable effect other than filling space. For the most part, Love’s delivery feels flat, bored, and macho, making his comic verses curdle into pissy screeds, as on “Clowns”: You are what you eat now, babyYou’re shit to meI died a thousand times now, now all I seeCrackheads to the leftAnd clowns to the rightI’m falling down the stairsNo jiggy for me tonight Some small details capture the ruckus Fat Dog were aiming for. The thick, tendony bass on “Wither” is excellent. “All the Same” kicks off with a lubed-rubber synth line that smacks of early Nine Inch Nails. But the production often feels too trimmed and clean. The cresting strings on “I Am the King,” the pitched-up, crystalline backing vocals on “Clown,” and Love’s largely scuff-free voice don’t suit the material or capture the alleged force of Fat Dog’s live act. “When you’re releasing stuff to a big audience, the best you can hope for is that 50% of people love it and 50% of people hate it,” Chris Hughes said in an interview with DIY last year, his face coated in gold paint. “If people just have a lukewarm response then what’s the point?” Unfortunately, Fat Dog’s debut slumps right in that tepid puddle, weighed down by gimmicks, cheap irony, and unearned mythology. Rather than stoking rapture or rage, it prods with hollow indifference. More a whimper than a woof. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Dave Harrington,Skull Dream,7.4,Electronic / Jazz,"In 2019, Dave Harrington, lifelong New Yorker and stalwart of the city’s avant-garde jazz and improv scene, moved to Los Angeles with his partner. But before he left, the guitarist gathered some of the city’s best players, both contemporaries like bassist Spencer Zahn and longtime heroes like Steven Bernstein, and made one last New York record. Fittingly, Skull Dream is an album of patient, wistful explorations that seem unable to keep from casting their eyes California’s way, even as they celebrate a lifetime of rich musical relationships. The album is at times funereal and at times shot through with optimism; its generosity of spirit shines so brightly, its desire to be in two places at once so palpable that it blots out all boundaries—between places, between jazz and noise and Americana, but also between the songs themselves. If that means it gets a little same-y, well, so does a cross-country move. Harrington first came to prominence in Darkside, his collaboration with electronic producer Nicolás Jaar, where the hard slink of his stippling phrases—part soukous, part erotic murmur—dug creases in the otherwise placid surface of Jaar’s productions. Listening to his playing on their instant-classic 2013 album Psychic sometimes feels like watching someone run their tongue over black velvet. A regular at eclectic Lower East Side club Nublu, he quickly installed himself at L.A.’s ETA after the move, becoming a regular player in the surging local jazz scene. He also joined up with Real Estate’s Alex Bleeker and Vampire Weekend’s Chris Tomson, as well as keyboardist Zach Tenorio-Miller, to form the instantly beloved jam band Taper’s Choice, turning their mostly straightforward choogle inside out with effects-heavy leads that sometimes sound like they’re beamed in via choppy satellite. On Skull Dream, Harrington’s guitar tone is a little hoarse and a little spacey, and he often uses it to tangle notes into tumbleweeds, sounding like the 1980s version of Jerry Garcia trying his hand at some Duane Eddy and Link Wray. His last major release, 2019’s Pure Imagination, No Country, was credited to the Dave Harrington Group, and while Skull Dream’s solo billing might suggest a showcase for the guitarist’s grandest riffs and flashiest licks, he brings the same cooperation and composure to these songs as to his other projects, a collaborator in his own music. In opener “Dust String Peaks,” Harrington laces his patient lead through a sighing choir of saxophones and clarinets. It’s the kind of plaintive and plainly beautiful melodic line that sometimes made the Band sound like they were imagining their own funerals. The guitar and horns stroll over the patient strike of the drums with so much dignity, it feels valedictory, like the ensemble wants to sum up decades of accrued wisdom while it still has the time. Harrington occasionally allows himself a showy moment, as when the juicy horns of “Acid Western” give way to a guitar that sounds like a soprano sax, then an overdriven harmonica, and finally a wordless vocalist. But his instrument is largely beside the point, just one ray among many in the shifting light that shines and fades in what one track dubs a “Box of Sun.” Skull Dream’s songs have a similar relationship to the album as a whole. As with any prolonged goodbye, everything here is colored by a bittersweet vibe. Even the skronkiest tunes—like “Vistavision,” where the heat shimmers of guitar and battering horns jam the knotted percussion down into a grainy mash—seem to be playing out under a long shadow. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing: Consider the power of your best friend’s going-away party. Harrington has said that his priorities when mixing the album were to keep melody as prominent as possible, avoid needless obfuscation, and above all focus on allowing himself to pursue the sounds he likes, rather than something that might sound “right.” That freedom is key to Skull Dream’s thematic consistency, and to the largeness of its heart. But allowing those amber lights to shine so brightly without changing the colors flattens some of the ensemble’s dynamism over time and nearly edges the album into melodrama. The trade-off, though, is that Skull Dream is intimate and emotionally present in a way that this kind of music frequently is not; you can sense the affection coming off each of the players. In the same way that grainy clips of future Olympians carry a strange affective charge when juxtaposed with their present selves on the podium, Skull Dream is an encounter with both the romance and the tragedy of time—a portrait of how we got here, and a promise that there’s no going back.",0,"August 6, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dave-harrington-skull-dream/
Google Earth,Street View,8.0,Experimental / Rock,"Four years after his first direct-to-computer release, John Vanderslice’s devotion to digital has not flagged. The artist whose commitment to analog recording and vintage gear got him profiled in the New Yorker has embraced the possibilities of Ableton Live with the zeal of a convert. And whatever Vanderslice’s Damascus moment was—in interviews, he’s alternately credited being stuck at home early in the pandemic and watching a friend DJ under the influence of Silk Road molly—the shift has been complete. Beginning with 2020’s eeeeeeep! EP, Vanderslice’s finely wrought songwriting went from sharing space with his plugin and programming experiments to ceding it to them. Last year’s CRYSTALS 3.0 was essentially deconstructed glitch, with a lone indie-rock track sticking out like a hacked webstream. Internet ephemera entered his vocab; he started giving his songs titles like “cracked pass words” and “riingtones (78 BPM)” and “sitemap/raytheon technologies.” One such title, from 2022’s d E A T h ~ b U g (credited to ORANGEPURPLEBEACH), summarized his stylistic about-face wonderfully: “admin reveal / take cover”. On Street View, Vanderslice finds a balance between his headlong embrace of electronic production and his longstanding art-rock inclinations. On previous efforts, he appeared giddy with newfound possibilities, like a teen working a cracked copy of FL Studio. With Google Earth—a collaboration with producer and longtime friend James Riotto (Jamie xx, Strand of Oaks, Ezra Furman)—experimentation is still key to his process, but now it’s lab quality. Street View originated as a series of glorified jam sessions in which Riotto and Vanderslice would run MIDI channels between paired Elektron Monomachines and Machinedrums, trying to spark happy harmonic accidents that couldn’t be replicable. There’s nothing shaggy about the results—in classic John Vanderslice tradition, the album clocks in at 35 minutes—but Street View maintains twinned senses of play and purpose. A good deal of that focus may come from Riotto, a jazz acolyte who trained as an upright bassist. His debut album, 2022’s Trailing Speed Lines, was like a sedate reflection of Vanderslice’s stylistic upheaval, fluctuating between chamber pop and sequencer workouts. Street View merges these approaches into a kind of third-stream folktronica, patiently developed and grandly austere. On opening track “deep sea leaks,” Google Earth are a pair of ECM post-boppers, teasing out a series of melodic figures before settling on a regal six-note motif, eventually joined by Nicole McCabe on alto sax. As the programming morphs from patter to pulse, they introduce drummer Jason Slota with the steady hand of seasoned tape splicers. The foreboding “tendril embrace” loads Slota into a capsule and dispatches him to a craggy ice planet. By track’s end, his real-time reporting has turned into distorted crashes; the synths fire up a distress signal before flatlining. Slota and McCabe appear sparingly. Their contributions are more supplementary than transformative, warm touches deftly deployed against the often stark monophonics. At times, Google Earth summon a vastness that’s almost classical. On “JJOLTS,” they unveil a bassy monolith, then chip away at it with acidic sequencing and restless cymbal taps. The middle section features a cresting, oddly inverted chord progression—a mournful motorik. “GESTURES” feels like watching a catastrophic weather event develop, as strains of minimal and bleep techno converge and crash into an unresolving gothic cloud of chords. Wordless sampled vocals groan and stutter and cry to the skies, waiting for the storm to pass. In interviews, Vanderslice and Riotto have talked about how their mutually reinforcing interests in abstract electronic composition (and drugs) have pushed them further out. Nearly half of Street View is instrumental, but for Vanderslice, the texts represent another experiment: None of the lyrics are his. Riotto wrote and sings “wouldn’t you,” a glum ballad in which fingerpicked guitar and drum-machine blips orbit each other like meshed gears. Vanderslice’s wife, the artist Maria Vanderslice, wrote four songs. The lyrics to “deep sea leaks” and the trebly, glitchy “something complicated” are essentially Oblique Strategies prompts (“Make up date/Make up the date/March 15th”). But “re-materialize” is darkly funny, a portrait of someone who contemplates self-destruction (veering into oncoming traffic, mangling their hand in the garbage disposal) in order to, uh, jjolt themself back to reality. The destruction is total on “afterlife,” Street View’s closing track. The narrator slits their wrists and ends up in a shitty heaven, where there’s nothing to do but memorize Bible verses. “I asked someone, ‘Can I have children now that I’m dead?’,” Vanderslice sings, with a melody that recalls John Lennon’s “Imagine,” or Culture’s “Two Sevens Clash.” “‘Can I see David? He’s dead too.’” There’s no response. The drum machine oozes along in the pocket; McCabe blows some dejected sax. It sounds like a Dan Bejar Clicks & Cuts track. As assured as Street View is, it arrives in an era of major upheaval for its makers. In 2020, Vanderslice moved from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, shuttering Tiny Telephone, his iconic Mission District recording studio. (A satellite Tiny Telephone still operates in Oakland.) Two years later, after more than a decade as a first-call engineer at Tiny Telephone, Riotto opened his own studio in the San Gabriel Valley. The two are already recording their second album, while Vanderslice is working on his next solo album—and preparing to move to the Netherlands. A shift from consoles to DAWs, then, couldn’t have come at a better time for Google Earth. Like their namesake, they’ve successfully stretched a digital framework over the formerly physical reality. The result is a topography that’s at once recognizable and fascinatingly unreal.",0,"August 9, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/google-earth-james-riotto-john-vanderslice-street-view/
Chris Cohen,Paint a Room,7.4,Rock,"Chris Cohen writes songs so gentle and sweet they seem to practically nuzzle up against you, but he hasn’t always intended to be a steward of comfort. “I think that there’s something in my music that people misinterpret as like, contentment or being chill,” he told Flaunt in 2020, lamenting the times he’s noticed his laid-back bedroom pop crop up as background music in restaurants or at Urban Outfitters. “It might be something that I’m not succeeding at as a musician that makes people think that I think the world is fine and we should just feel good,” he said. “That’s like, the last thing that I want people to get from my music.” Cohen’s curse may just be that he’s too adept at crafting gorgeous, heavenly little songs. If there’s one throughline between the various projects he’s been a part of—be it Deerhoof, Weyes Blood, Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti, or the Curtains—it’s this sense of him tapping out cracks in the edges of soft pop without ever letting it shatter. “Damage,” the opening track off Paint a Room (his first new album in five years) puts this dichotomy front and center: As Cohen, dismayed, sings about how abuses of power manifest in society, a summery bed of horns courtesy of Jeff Parker envelops his dread in a pastoral calm. “Somebody’s love was shot down again,” he coos, just moments before a smooth saxophone solo swirls into view. Paint a Room is full of these types of frozen-in-time vignettes, as Cohen’s intimate songwriting comes to life in blossoming arrangements seemingly plucked straight out of a vintage California bachelor pad. Inspired by Uruguayan and Brazilian artists like Eduardo Mateo and Milton Nascimento, who pushed their folk pop to proggy, boundless new places in the ’70s and ’80s, Cohen lines his songs with flutes, congas, and Clavinets that instill a psychedelically tropical lilt. At times, the subtly pretty haze can threaten to dissipate into thin air, but its highs demonstrate why Cohen remains one of indie rock’s most quietly wondrous songwriters. Cohen’s melodies convey everything his songs need completely on their own (he typically plots out all his chords and phrasings well in advance of figuring out what to actually say). His hooks can feel so simple and intuitive that it’s as if they’ve always been there: The central piano motif in “Dog’s Face” materializes as gracefully as a mist unspooling over the Bay, before a lightly dissonant guitar riff begins to pulse like distant thunder. The ghostly keyboard riff in “Randy’s Chimes” creeps around as if it were solving a mystery, while “Physical Address” cruises on a playful bossa-nova groove that glides up and down like a kid riding an elevator. When Cohen does attempt to say something more concrete with his lyrics, his concerns tend toward searching for hope in the modern day. On the radiant “Sunever,” he speaks to a transgender child about the future: “Up and up you climb, soon you’ll leave us far behind,” he murmurs tenderly, promising them that “you’re gonna find a way” and letting a joyous fiddle paint the path. Vibrant moments like this bring Cohen’s introverted musings to life; at other times Paint a Room’s mellowness slumps into the sedate. “Cobb Estate” rides a three-note guitar arpeggio so lackadaisical it almost feels like pre-rehearsal noodling, and the Meat Puppets-like cowpunk groove of “Wishing Well,” though intriguing as an experiment, never seems to find a melodic center to rest its heels on. Cohen’s inviting arrangements may not always strike the delicate balance between peace and uncertainty that he strives for, but when they do, his music remains as warm and rewarding as a fresh cup of coffee at dawn.

Chow Lee,Sex Drive,7.7,Rap,"Chow Lee treats being horny as a bona fide artform. “You and your coochie is twins/You’ve got a beautiful vagina,” he repeats on “ms. beautiful V!,” his biggest single this year. Go ahead and call him shameless, but his sex raps offer a true pervert’s cocktail: crass, silly, and genuine. The New York rapper serves up this mélange à trois garnished with snappy punchlines, the banter always playful. Only a charismatic goofball could use the pickup line, “Wanna have sex? I’m the best sexer!” and come out looking slick. Lee’s self-abasement is a reminder that intimacy requires vulnerability, but it also underlines another truth: Fucking, and everything leading up to it, should be fun. When Lee and Cash Cobain dropped 2 Slizzy 2 Sexy a couple years ago, the duo rapped over Tong Li and Prince Royce tracks, announcing sample drill as fertile ground for cosmopolitan horndog anthems. Compared to other amorous styles (lovers rock, pagode romântico), sexy drill is musically and lyrically brash, addictive for its hedonistic indulgences. On his 2023 solo album Hours After the Club, Lee amped up the Jersey club kicks and nocturnal ambience while crooning about G-spots, his Auto-Tune cutting through flashy synths. His new album, Sex Drive, arrives amid a surge of sexy drill, but while artists like wolfacejoeyy and Baby Osama have brought the sound into new territories, Lee remains the genre’s greatest entertainer. Lee lives to please, and Sex Drive refines his craft: He’s still a riot, but these 19 songs are thoughtfully arranged to reveal the subtleties of his sexual pursuits. On opener “advance w her!,” the kick drum ruptures the air before shifting to a lighter, Jersey-inspired floater. His one-track mind revs with racecar intensity; his declaration that he could never get married serves as a victory lap. He’s of a different mind on “LSD,” a sultry R&B track led by drifting synths. He sings about earning love and working through conflict, bringing up cunnilingus in the sweetest tone. Occasionally, we hear a woman moan as Lee sings about wifing her. Our libido, Sex Drive reminds us, can unearth new versions of ourselves. Though Lee can handily carry a song on his own, the best features on Sex Drive elevate his storytelling. Flo Milli’s verse on the “swag it!” remix is so cocksure that it reframes Lee’s constant questioning as impassioned pleading. Anycia’s presence on “get back!” is similarly domineering. Her slow drawl stands forward in the mix, making Lee sound like a grateful kid as he sings “Damn!” in a squirrely voice. The men’s contributions are more mixed. “tequila vacay!” is most egregious, opting for vaguely tropical mush as singer Roy Woods does his best Weeknd and Post Malone impressions. Unsurprisingly, Cobain and Bay Swag’s appearances on “act bad twin!” are a highlight: It’s a Jersey club slow jam that samples PARTYNEXTDOOR and lands in a pool of dreamy synths. Hearing Lee sing about a woman “trying to match [his] sins” is a moment of sincere tenderness. The maximalist beats of “addys!” and “bangbang!” stack up sounds into rapturous, multisensory ecstasy. More straightforward tracks like “settings!” get by on the strength of Lee’s conviction (“I cannot power down!”). Sex Drive ends with “skeleTONS,” where a 40-esque beat from producer Skeyez positions the record as post-Drake—think gauzy instrumentals laced with heart-on-sleeve confessionals, except, you know, actually exciting to hear in 2024. It’s Lee’s versatility across all these styles that make his constant fantasizing feel like a worthwhile model for living. In his hands, plain old perversion is made to feel prismatic.",0,"September 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chow-lee-sex-drive/
A. G. Cook,Britpop,7.8,Electronic,"The logic of today’s pop culture is lore, and the keepers of the lore are the fandoms. As recently observed in the Swiftieverse, the stans cannot live on songs alone—they demand worldbuilding. They shall have Easter eggs. They will make video essays about whether or not Harry Styles wears a wig. These are ideal conditions for A. G. Cook, the producer and persona at the heart of the PC Music universe. His third solo full-length is a dizzying concept album that spills over into animated videos, bespoke websites, and several millennia’s worth of made-up lore. Appearing in the midst of the megawatt rollout for Brat, the Charli XCX album on which Cook returns as a lead producer, Britpop was never going to be the biggest pop album of the year as measured by social clout—but it just might be the biggest by volume. As his first album since the end of PC Music, the era-defining experimental pop label that ceased releasing new music last year after a decade, Britpop follows 2020’s seven-disc solo sprawl 7G and its rapid sequel, the dense and ambitious Apple. This time around he’s kept a lid on things—it’s a comparatively tight triple album, eight tracks per disc, arranged along the themes of past, present, and future (a classic tarot spread, not coincidentally). It’s also a sprawling multimedia project complete with characters, timelines, online games, videos, and bonus downloads accessed via three familiar-looking websites: Wandcamp, Wheatport, and Witchfork. (All three were recently “acquired by an undisclosed multidimensional conglomerate,” according to a pop-up.) In a way, the PC Music enterprise was always about making websites, as Cook—a computer nerd before he became a musician—explained to DIY back in 2014. While a complete hermeneutics of the Cookverse is beyond the scope of an album review (and would spoil the quest) the video for “Soulbreaker” might be the place to start: a time-traveling animation by Gustaf Holtenäs that’s stuffed with lore to be decoded by the faithful of the PC Music subreddit. Britpop begins in the Past, with the first disc a kind of epitaph to PC Music’s now-classic sound, a shiny playground of boing-splat colors and neon noise. It sounds like Cook is tying up loose ends, perhaps emptying the archives. There are mallow-soft synths and stinging trance supersaws, hairsprayed ’80s syndrums and speedy riffs recalling the “impossible music” of early influence Conlon Nancarrow. Hyper-chopped helium vocals appear in various states of disarray, from Charli XCX trilling “Brit-brit-brit like Britpop” on the title track to the shattered verbiage of “Prismatic.” The third disc is on similar ground musically but with a few more solidly structured songs and, on “Butterfly Craft,” a very un-PC excursion into cable-tangled radiophonic noise. The Past and Future discs will appeal directly to PC heads, with few big surprises. Even at peak intensity—the speedrun finish of “Prismatic,” the restless mechanics of “Luddite Factory Operator”—Cook’s surfaces are varnished, his structures both effortless and complex. There’s none of the naivety or pleasingly “wrong” tilt of those remarkable early productions, like GFOTY’s “Bobby” or Hannah Diamond’s “Pink and Blue.” This is the work of an accomplished, L.A.-facing pop producer. When Charli enters the room—as she also does on “Lucifer,” a catchy, moody-girl highlight also featuring Addison Rae—the scene comes alive, while the tracks that rest on ultra-processed, unintelligible vocals, like the Balearic “Crescent Sun,” take on the weightless quality of a hologram. Which is why the Present disc, where Cook takes the mic, is the surprise standout of the three. Picking up where Apple left off, these eight songs also take their cue from Thy Slaughter’s Soft Rock—Cook’s witty collaboration with PC Music oldtimer easyFun—to drive deeper into digitally enhanced fuzz rock. Infused with the wistful melancholy that British comedian Bill Bailey once identified in his countryfolk (because “52 percent of our days are overcast”) the Present disc falls somewhere between cultish bedroom-punk (The Durutti Column, Felt) and scratchy ’90s indie (Teenage Fanclub, the Breeders, late ’90s Blur)—and delivers some sweet, sweet guitar tones to boot. Our troubadour gets close to the mic, using telephone effects and Auto-Tune to boost the grain of his far-from-powerful voice, while the guitars do quiet-quiet-LOUD grunge dynamics (“Green Man,” “Greatly”) and wailing mini-solos (“Nice to Meet You”). Most addictive is “Bewitched,” an egg punk anthem for the children of Weezer and Ash, iced with a perfect hook (“I heard her say, Abra-abracadabra”) that echoes an oldie by Ian Dury. Buried inside the lyrics is a sense of distance and loss, from the awkwardly British (“I’ll miss you greatly”) to the open wound of “Without,” a tribute to his creative twin flame SOPHIE, who died in 2021: “An emptiness, a silhouette/I never guessed the loudest sounds are hollow.” Cook has spent the past few years living in America, including a lockdown in rural Montana, home to his girlfriend, the singer Alaska Reid. Feeling like a foreigner inevitably made him more aware of his Britishness, and seemingly more eager to play it up—hence the enduring Beatles mop-top. In place of the playful meta-ironies and commercial sheen of the PC Music world, Cook aligns himself with myth and magic (“Green Man,” “Crone,” “Bewitched”), stocking his lyrics with an apothecary’s worth of amulets, manuscripts, gargoyles, “skulls on the shelf” and “membranes stacked in the catacombs.” It’s an anachronistic pivot, and with it, Cook joins a long tradition of British artists who have looked to the country’s distant past for a sense of identity unspoiled by rubbish modern life, from the Pre-Raphaelites’ obsession with King Arthur and William Blake’s vision of Albion to the reactionary nostalgia of the Kinks, Smiths, and Libertines. A longing for the notional good old days is hammered out again in Timothy Luke’s design for the album campaign, with A. G. Cook written in cod-heraldic lettering straight out of merrie olde England, while Britpop appears in the zippily optimistic curves of Mexico Olympic, the logotype designed for the ’68 Games and adapted by Pulp in the mid ’90s—notably, the last two moments when Britain was seen to be swinging. Cook’s embrace of the mythic past mirrors a wider turn towards the wyrd in British culture, but also puts some distance between him and the PC Music experiment. By the time it wound down last year, the label had permeated the entire fabric of pop, from Beyoncé’s Renaissance (Cook has a credit on “All Up in Your Mind”) to Danny L Harle’s work for Carly Rae Jepsen and Dua Lipa, and even Camila Cabello’s recent hyperpop pivot, “I LUV IT.” Mission accomplished? Perhaps, but we can assume that Cook gets his kicks from subverting the pop hierarchy, not being absorbed into it. Not unlike Cowboy Carter hitching herself to the Wild West imaginary, Britpop opens a practical portal between Cook’s old universe—hard, bright, aggressively contemporary—and a seductively oppositional dimension of folklore, fantasy, fuzz rock, and magic.",0,"May 9, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/a-g-cook-britpop/
Omar Apollo,God Said No,7.4,Pop/R&B,"On his second album, God Said No, Omar Apollo wields his heartbreak like a butterfly knife. On “Done With You,” an airy, brass-assisted pop song, he cloaks moments of devastating vulnerability with a protective layer of detached cool. In the shrugged-off chorus, he insists that he’s done with his lover—a toughness that stands in stark contrast to his earlier, velvety pleas for them to let him go. The video matches this energy, depicting the star as he alternates between waving blades at the viewer and running them painfully along his jawline. It’s a fitting visual representation of a record where Apollo sharpens some of his darkest moments into glinting pop gems. God Said No originated from three months Apollo spent in London in 2023. Following the release of his debut full-length Ivory in 2022, tours with SZA and Billie Eilish, and a nomination for Best New Artist at the 2023 Grammys, the Mexican American singer-songwriter was riding a professional high, but privately nursing a broken heart as he surveyed the wreckage of a relationship. Working with familiar collaborators Teo Halm (here as executive producer), Carter Lang, and Blake Slatkin, Apollo first sketched out the 14 songs in the prestigious Abbey Road Studios, later finishing the album in the U.S. With his biggest hit to date being the gut-wrenching “Evergreen (You Didn’t Deserve Me at All),” Apollo already has something of a reputation as a heartbreak aficionado—as he recently told Complex, “my natural state is always longing.” But on this record, he paints that emotion with every shade on his palette. God Said No stretches far beyond downbeat balladeering; Apollo weaves his sadness, anger, and self-doubt through a collection of anthemic choruses and disco-tinged pop tracks. On “Less of You” and “Drifting,” Apollo recalls Robyn’s style of tearful dancefloor anthem, the former combining Giorgio Moroder-esque vocoder melodies with a eulogy for a relationship that’s slowly evanescing, and the latter sprinkling Apollo’s romantic disillusionment over a breezy, Balearic-type beat. These shades of understated Europop are a new element of Apollo’s sound, brooding where once he might have belted. But his voice remains the star of the show, particularly when he’s trading gorgeous, tumbling melodies with Sudanese Canadian singer-songwriter Mustafa on the plaintive “Plane Trees.” While they are often luxurious to listen to, Apollo’s ballads represent the album’s least compelling moments. “Empty” and “Dispose of Me” meander drowsily, doing little to distinguish this record from his previous bedroom R&B releases. A meditative voice note about grief from Pedro Pascal also wears thin on repeat listens. The album is more arresting when Apollo knowingly leans into the more unhinged aspects of heartbreak. Take the rousing lead single, “Spite,” where, with a hook that bristles with delicious fury, Apollo walks a razor-thin line between loving and hating the partner who’s keeping him hanging on. Over sulky licks of guitar, he brings the confusing loneliness of a situationship to life through bittersweet vignettes of dying flowers, unread text messages, and long flights taken alone. Elsewhere, he howls an embittered and desperate hook on the expansive “How,” his anger as coldly insistent as the drum machine that backs it. These wild-eyed moments hint at more complex and ambitious possibilities for Apollo as a storyteller and as a pop star. On “Life’s Unfair,” a strutting funk-pop song, Apollo coolly admits to doing “something real bad” to someone he once wanted to marry. The trap-inflected standout “Against Me” takes a kind of hyper-masculine, posturing response to being dumped. On these songs, Apollo may be full of longing, but he’s also flawed, fired-up, and the self-proclaimed “baddest bitch.” God Said No stands apart from Apollo’s previous releases not only because of its genre experimentation and its stickier choruses, but for its willingness to get ugly. Here, Apollo has been knocked down, but he doesn’t play the victim. Instead, he bares his teeth. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Keeley Forsyth,The Hollow,7.7,Experimental,"When Keeley Forsyth sings, you become acutely aware of the body emitting her voice. Not what it looks like, necessarily—not its age or shape or gender or skin color—but its raw physicality, its fundament of bones and sinew. She sings with her whole chest: diaphragm tightening, air filling the lungs, muscles twisting up the length of her throat, unleashing a presence that drips with the blood of the flesh that produced it. Some singers try to make their art sound effortless; Forsyth emphasizes the physical strain. Perhaps this sound was born of desperation. In 2017, Forsyth, who has been acting professionally since she was a teenager—mostly on British television, though she also has recent credits in Guardians of the Galaxy and Poor Things—suffered a psychological and physical breakdown that left her tongue paralyzed for a month. The desperation of that experience was palpable on her 2020 debut, Debris, an album of haunted minimalist folk that she released at the age of 40. Limbs, which followed in 2022, was more conventionally beautiful. But on The Hollow, her third album, she puts her gale-force vibrato in the service of her most intense music yet. “I’ve always enjoyed making people feel a bit uncomfortable with the sounds and music I make,” Forsyth once told The Quietus; here, it sometimes feels as if she wants to terrify. The album begins with stately restraint; over slow-moving organ tones, her voice mournful and controlled, she sketches an agonizing search for meaning intercut with a single jarring image of physical desolation, “Veins like dry stalks/That can never bring water.” The title track, which follows, begins with liturgical grace, but her voice—digitally layered, quavering severely—assumes the sound of a sob lodged in the throat, her words at first nearly unintelligible. A dirgelike mantra (“There is no help here/Not for me”) gives way to a startling cry—“Shake my life/Out of my mouth”—delivered with larynx-rending force. Forsyth and her producer, Ross Downes, continue to channel the same influences that informed her previous music, principally Scott Walker’s Tilt and Meredith Monk, along with the spiritual yearning of Arvo Pärt and the cerebral goth of This Mortal Coil. Even when she raises the hairs on the back of your neck, she evokes an awesome, awful beauty. On “Eve,” she offers a tender tribute to her grandmother, who raised her: “Nothing can/Tear us apart/Let the body lay down/And die.” (On The Hollow, even the songs in a major key are about death.) On “Turning,” she is borne aloft, chanting and bellowing on the surging floodwaters of Colin Stetson’s arpeggiated saxophone; it’s a romantic landscape painting rendered in sound. Forsyth’s lyrics have never been sharper, or stranger. “Slush” is an onomatopoeic poem about children playing in snow that assumes the doomy menace of one of Grimm’s fairy tales. In “A Shift,” she layers two songs in parallel: One is a spoken-word text about an actor donning their costume, the other a wailing rendition of “We Are Women, We Are Strong,” an anthem from the miners’ strikes of the early 1980s, a provocative fusion of class solidarity, feminism, and creative labor. On “In the Corner,” some of her more oblique constructions—“storm fallen days” and “an infinite glass secretion”—remind me, faintly, of ML Buch’s surreal menagerie of “flesh on air” and “flames shards goo,” but shot through with horror instead of twee. The album takes its title from a mineshaft that Forsyth stumbled upon while wandering the countryside near her home, and much of the record feels charged with the sort of uncanny power that holes in the ground can hold over the imagination. In her most striking lyrics, Forsyth maps an eerie intersection of landscape, spirit, and the human body—“crossroads of flesh,” as she puts it in “In the Corner.” Branches grow through her sleeping body; dust wakes within her, a specter of death brought to life. The lyrics abound with roads and bridges, brown fields, clouds scraping at the land: scenes straight out of Breugel, terrifying images of what we might call the Old Wyrd Europe, where nature and fate are intertwined. Most of her songs are mercifully short, many under three minutes long, as though Forsyth was aware that music of such intensity could easily overwhelm. The gentlest song is one of the shortest: “Creature,” which closes the record. Over spare, searching piano from her frequent collaborator Matthew Bourne, she sings, “There is no help here/Not for me,” reprising a line from “The Hollow.” But rather than desperate or harried, she sounds at peace. If the hollow is a destabilizing rupture, it is also a sanctuary—and a vessel, a source of strength; a resonant chamber, empty until sound spills forth.",0,"May 16, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/keeley-forsyth-the-hollow/
Panda Bear,,7.6,Electronic / Folk/Country,"Like oddball Taylor Swifts scrabbling for indie chart position, Panda Bear and Sonic Boom have unleashed a fifth iteration of their excellent 2022 album Reset: Reset Mariachi EP follows Reset in Dub, Reset (Songbook Instrumentals + Remixes), and an actual, honest-to-goodness Reset Songbook, featuring the songs’ sheet music. Excessive? Perhaps a little. But it’s hard to argue with vision. The duo originally wanted to record with a mariachi band on “Tropic of Cancer,” for Panda Bear’s 2015 album Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper, which Sonic Boom co-produced. But the idea remained a pipe dream until the duo were booked for a show in Mexico in 2023, leading to a recording session with Mexico City band Mariachi 2000 de Cutberto Pérez. Few albums merit the remake treatment as much as Reset, a fascinating excursion into 1950s pop and child-friendly melodies that sound simultaneously innocent and suspiciously narcotic, a record both hard to pin down in its unusual combinations yet refreshingly straightforward in its clean melodic lines and two-chord loops. That simplicity makes Reset an unusually malleable record—a Lego set for inventive minds. The original “Danger” made compelling use of its dreamy acoustic guitar, handclaps, and Everly Brothers sample; it shone as a left-field reggae number when remixed by Adrian Sherwood as “Danger Dub”; and it resonates with cinematic romance as “Peligro,” thanks to the glistening strings and floral trumpets of Mariachi 2000 de Cutberto Pérez. The song’s transformation is complete when the Mexico City band’s vocalists replace Panda Bear’s slightly reedy Spanish-language singing with their rich, full-bodied voices on a second version of the song. Reset’s “Livin’ in the After” is a more obvious candidate for the Cutberto Pérez treatment, its swooping string line—sampled from the Drifters’ 1960 single “Save the Last Dance for Me”—tinted with the elegant drama associated with mariachi music. (Although the Mexican musicians were apparently bemused by the simplicity of Panda Bear and Sonic Boom’s songs, so perhaps we shouldn’t make too much of this apparent similarity.) Whatever the case, Mariachi 2000 keep the original song’s instrumentation largely in place but amp up the party vibes, adding layers of ambient chatter, supporting voices, and a jubilant trumpet line, yielding one of the most vibrant good-time songs I’ve heard in a long while. After passing through Reset and Reset in Dub, “Livin’ in the After” may have found its definitive version as the profoundly joyous “Viviendo en las sequelas,” especially when voiced with respectful gravity by the collected singers of Mariachi 2000. The philosophical listener might take a moment to consider the powerfully universal language of music that has taken this song, forged in Portugal by musicians from Baltimore and Rugby, England, all the way to Mexico City. But the best reaction is surely to dance, grin, and hit rewind. If any residual cynicism survives, you could perhaps question Panda Bear and Sonic Boom’s decision to make a mariachi record when Mexican music is booming worldwide; Panda Bear’s own Spanish accent is notable more for its enthusiasm than its fluidity. Reset Mariachi is also pretty lightweight, made up of three versions of “Peligro” and another three of “Viviendo en las sequelas”: one with vocals by Panda Bear and Sonic Boom, one as sung by Mariachi 2000, and one a “Songbook Instrumental.” It is simultaneously too much and not quite enough. But Panda Bear and Sonic Boom put heart, soul, and sweat into Reset Mariachi, going so far as to a six-person team to translate the two songs’ lyrics into Mexican Spanish that would respect their rhythmic flow. You can feel this honest enthusiasm radiating from the record: The duo’s vocals project a sincerity that transcends the linguistic limitations. If this is the final chapter in the Reset story, as Sonic Boom suggests, then our heroes swagger off into the evermore with a glint in the eye, their work completed with a glorious, unexpected flourish.

Julia-Sophie,forgive too slow,7.2,Electronic,"Oxford and Lyon musician Julia-Sophie makes music about the temptation to relive your past: the more regrets that remain, the stronger the gravitational pull. Julia-Sophie dates several of her own regrets back to Little Fish, a short-lived garage frock’n’roll duo she led at the turn of the 2010s. Little Fish toured with Hole, Blondie, and Juliette Lewis (2010 was a time)—names splashy enough that, over a decade later, interviewers still ask about her stint in the band, thirsty for anything that might resemble Courtney Love goss. There are stories—a book-length mythology of this band exists, called Fuck the Radio, We’ve Got Apple Juice—but years later, Julie-Sophie remembered her time as a twentysomething industry scrapper not with rock bravado or “happy to be here” tact, but as a life that “broke [her], both as an artist and a human.” Julia-Sophie spent the intervening years learning to unbreak herself—and to reconstruct her music. Little Fish sounded about what you’d expect from triangulating Hole, Blondie, and Juliette Lewis: solid, in a kitschy sort of way. Julia-Sophie’s next project, pop-adjacent collective Candy Says, similarly sounded about what you’d expect from a band that recorded a dark electro cover of “Running Up That Hill” for a Netflix movie. Then she went mostly solo, working with a collaborator credited only as “B,” and her music got stranger. Julia-Sophie and B share an affinity with downtempo artists like Four Tet and Nicolás Jaar for heady sounds and studio work engineered like a puzzle box. Percussion sounds like nervous flutters; arrangements sound like the claustrophobic interiors of bathyspheres. “I feel like it’s been pretty intense listening to Julia-Sophie so far,” Julia-Sophie told The Quietus in 2021. Basic themes can be extrapolated from the titles of her past EPs, y? and </3, but the levity doesn’t extend past these cutesy winks at heartbreak and existential questioning. She hinted that the follow-up record might be “warmer”; that didn’t happen. forgive too slow is as grueling a listen, and as good an introduction, as either EP: songs, crystalline like teardrops, about mistakes, heartbreaks, and relationships that never got far enough to be either. On paper, this doesn’t sound much different from the tastefully emotive pop that can be heard every week on BBC Radio 6. (Her singles have also been playlisted there.) But Julia-Sophie’s confessionals actually confess things. “Numb” makes a statement with a Depeche Mode synth-throb that goes past “chilly” to “unforgiving” and an equally self-lacerating monologue: “Instead of loving you back, I cheated and I lied, I lost myself in drugs and I lost myself inside.” The track derives its power not from raw emotion but from the dispassionate tone of a disaster surveyor itemizing wreckage. Preceding this is “Lose My Mind,” an electro track with an arrangement that sounds like it’s periodically overclocking and a mood heightened to the point of horror. Preceding that is “I Was Only”: a withering melody, a repeated shuddering chord, and a cocoon-like arrangement tuned for maximum 3 a.m. languishing. That kind of stuff isn’t sustainable, of course. Just as evolution pulls animals ever closer toward becoming crabs, market forces pull downtempo artists ever closer toward crossover pop. To its credit, forgive too slow complicates what could have been mid, sadgirl mush. “Falling” is a slow-burn yearner, but it doesn’t enter the bedroom chorus without flipping “O Superman” first. “Comfort You” is essentially an adult-contemporary ballad—gloss over some of the lyrics, and it could soundtrack a slow dance. But its arrangement is bookended by a hesitant click track and an ominous buzz, and Julia-Sophie’s vocal never quite sounds present in the romantic moment. And then there’s “Wishful Thinking,” one of the most overt Body Talk rips in a truly crowded field; the synth intro is right out of “Hang With Me,” and the general situation is reminiscent of a “Call Your Girlfriend” halfway-affair. Julia-Sophie’s song is more introverted than Robyn’s, and her story far less hopeful: This love triangle won’t be fixed by a phone call. But as a single, it just sounds like a ruthless pop pivot—one so effective that it actually misrepresents the album. “Wishful Thinking” makes much more sense in its proper sequencing. The following track, “Better,” is the bleakest on the record: plainspoken misery over a flatline buzz. But it ends with a reprise of the “Wishful Thinking” intro, not spangly but frantic, not neatly packaged but ricocheting all over the place. The two songs feel like halves of a complete story: having an illicit crush, giving it up or failing at it, then trying to summon the leftover energy to pull yourself out.",0,"August 2, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/julia-sophie-forgive-too-slow/
Fatboy Slim,You’ve Come a Long Way Baby,8.5,Electronic,"In September 1986, the BBC aired a half-hour television program about the Housemartins, a jangle-pop quartet billed as “the fourth-best band from Hull.” In its first few minutes, singer and guitarist Paul Heaton wanders the band’s shared home, trying to locate the source of a racket. It turns out to be the bassist, working two turntables and a mixer. Heaton leans in: “What is all this crap, anyway?” “Well, uh, this is the Clash, and that’s Run-D.M.C.,” replies an impish young man with gelled blond hair and an Adidas rugby shirt. “And if you glue ’em together you get, uh, Clash-D.M.C.” The bassist gives his bandmate a brief tutorial before the latter gives up. “I’ll leave it to the professionals,” Heaton sneers. It’s tough to imagine that anyone in ’86 who knew what a DJ was would believe that Norman Cook would someday become the biggest DJ in the world. Hell, it would’ve been tough to imagine in 1996. Although Cook had spent much of the intervening decade behind the decks—even releasing a loops-and-samples CD for aspiring producers—that year he began playing guitar in Freak Power, a lounge-funk act on Island Records. They were riding high: After appearing in a Levi’s commercial, a reissue of their 1993 single “Tune In, Turn On, Cop Out” had gone Top 5. In June, the band traveled to Switzerland for the massive OpenAir St. Gallen Festival, on a bill with Bush, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Sex Pistols. As Freak Power took the stage before an audience of thousands, Cook recalled thinking, “I’m a really crap guitarist. What am I doing here? I’ve spent the last 10 years getting pissed in nightclubs, learning how to DJ.” Nevertheless, Island preferred that Cook—by this point a veteran remixer and house producer—focus on guitar. Freak Power’s contract specifically barred him from putting out records on other labels, even under pseudonyms. He still did it, of course. He just had to pretend he had nothing to do with the likes of Cheeky Boy, Sunny Side Up, Yum Yum Head Food, and the Feelgood Factor—many of whom had releases on his record label, Southern Fried. When Cook began a residency at the Concorde, a 300-capacity bingo hall in his seaside hometown of Brighton, he and his latest alter ego—Fatboy Slim—were billed as two separate DJs. Fatboy Slim was originally a favor for a friend. Damian Harris was another Brighton DJ; he was at Loaded Records, a local house label that Cook had worked with. Convinced Harris was too busy futzing with vintage synths and breakbeats to do his job, Loaded’s owners called him in for a meeting. But instead of getting canned, Harris got his own imprint. Skint Records received a three-release trial with two conditions: no house music and no losing money. Norman was Damian’s weapon of choice—a devotee of rare groove and hip-hop who understood both the DJ booth and the stage. “Fuse dance and rock,” was Harris’ apocryphal command. The result was “Santa Cruz,” which veered between sun-scrambled dream pop and a nagging freakbeat swiped from a Lulu single. Issued in 1995 as SKINT 1, “Santa Cruz” only sold about 800 copies, but it was quickly caught in a slipstream beneath the dominant dance culture. In August 1994, the London indie Heavenly Records kicked off the Heavenly Sunday Social in a pub basement, where a who’s-who of idiosyncratic DJs (Andrew Weatherall, David Holmes, Leftfield) spun raucous jams underneath a broken clock stuck, portentously, at 11:55. Most weeks, the headliners were the Dust Brothers, two young men who revered “Tomorrow Never Knows” and techno equally. Initially, the Social offered something more like a set of signifiers than a named style. “We’re talking nitrates on wax, music made up of big fuck off freakbeat breaks, dirty great riffs from mad old ’70s synths that are bust up and sellotaped back together,” wrote Heavenly A&R Robin Turner in the liner notes to the 1996 DJ mix Brit Hop and Amyl House (“brit-hop” and “amyl house” being two early names for this emerging sound). The first time Cook visited the Social, he was astounded to hear the Dust Brothers (about to become the Chemical Brothers) playing “Santa Cruz.” It was “like meeting the rest of my long-lost family,” he recalled. The title of the debut Fatboy Slim LP, 1996’s Better Living Through Chemistry, was a partial homage to the Brothers. With Harris and DJ/promoter Gareth Hansome, Cook brought the Social spirit to Brighton. They called their night the Big Beat Boutique. It would become both the namesake and the proving ground of a dance-music style that Cook unwittingly helped birth. As clubbers handed him tabs of E, Cook spun Northern soul, acid house, golden-age rap, and reggae, all tied together with cracking breakbeats. Within weeks, the Boutique had lines down the block. In 1998, the dance-music monthly Muzik named it the 39th best club of all time. The following January, the second Fatboy Slim LP topped the UK album chart. Cook had considered naming it Viva La Underachiever or Let’s Hear It for the Little Guy—too disingenuous. Instead, he picked a phrase he’d seen on a pair of thrift-shop boxers. He didn’t know You’ve Come a Long Way Baby was a slogan for an American cigarette brand. He’d often claim to pay America little mind. But he could hardly have made a dance album better suited for the Yanks. Fatboy Slim was tonally unlike the other big-beat acts beginning to cross over: The Chemical Brothers were mad scientists splicing the distinct highs of psychedelia and headrush techno; the Prodigy were punkish provocateurs, sidechaining dynamite to their breaks. Intentionally or not, these groups made electronica for an alt-rock audience—a godsend for Hollywood music supervisors whose understanding of club music ended with industrial. But the vibe of You’ve Come a Long Way Baby was pure pop. It was less a club night than a boardwalk arcade: a boozy, manic romp past a thousand blaring speakers. The first single showed how much he had altered the initial formula. “The Rockafeller Skank” put Northern soul on a longboard and shot it through the curl. It was a guitar overload: Cook used the Just Brothers’ choppy riff as the backbone, adding surfy twang from Duane Eddy, the Tremeloes, and a forgotten John Barry soundtrack. With its builds, drop-outs, and beat switches, the single was tailor-made for the pop listener with one hand on the radio dial. At one point, Cook starts pinging wildly between samples and channels: All the guitars at his disposal blur into a single cartoon character, ricocheting around the screen. The crowning touch came from an instrumental LP from Vinyl Dogs, a New Jersey label known for its compilations of choice breaks. Cook ignored the music, fixating on the tossed-off intro from heavyweight rap producer Lord Finesse. He chopped it into its component syllables, fed them into a MIDI keyboard, and tapped out an all-time earworm: “Right about now, the funk soul brother/Check it out now, the funk soul brother…” On both sides of the Atlantic, “The Rockafeller Skank” and its maker were praised with faint damnation. Billboard called it “an organically simple masterpiece.” The Guardian conceded that “Norman seems to have found his niche, slapping together big, catchy, brilliantly dumb breakbeat numbers.” And Q assured readers that You’ve Come a Long Way Baby was “simple, unsubtle, soaraway stuff with a sell-by date that probably won’t be difficult to read for much longer.” In a 1999 Rolling Stone article titled “Fatboy Slim: Funk Sold Brother,” Marc Weingarten detailed all the licensing deals that Astralwerks, Fatboy Slim’s American label, had struck: commercials for Air Jordans, Oldsmobile, and Surge soda; soundtracks and trailers for Go, Office Space, Ten Things I Hate About You, and Cruel Intentions. He quoted a shrugging Cook: “I make a certain kind of instrumental music they like using. You can hear 15 seconds of my stuff and it makes complete sense.” Cook’s glibness was typical. But he knew how much work it took to become that legible. You’ve Come a Long Way Baby inverted the cliche that second albums are more difficult because you’ve been working on the first one your whole life. Better Living Through Chemistry was a glorified singles compilation that offered ample pleasures (the hectic acid house of “Give the Po’ Man a Break,” the spaghetti western trip-hop of “The Weekend Starts Here”) but largely upheld dance conventions: gradual builds; sustained, patient development of specific hooks. Cook crammed his whole career into the follow-up. As the heaving stacks of vinyl on the cover of You’ve Come a Long Way Baby’s American edition hinted, Norman Cook was a crate-digger at heart. While still a Housemartin, he’d completed “The Finest Ingredients,” a landmark gray-market hip-hop megamix. Spare and bouncy, sampling everything from Led Zeppelin to Whodini to The Jungle Book, the mix earned John Peel play and put him in touch with a small community of British bedroom pause-tapers: Ashley Beedle, Bomb the Bass, Coldcut. After the Housemartins broke up, Cook started booking work as a remixer: sometimes solo, sometimes alongside Danny Poku (aka D Mob, whose pop-friendly fusion of acid and hip-house did well on both sides of the Atlantic). For the Double Trouble remix of Eric B. & Rakim’s “I Know You Got Soul,” Cook and Poku grafted on the Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back”: the equivalent of remixer steroids. Their version not only out-charted the original, it placed higher than “Paid in Full,” with its groundbreaking Coldcut remix. After issuing a couple hip-house singles (one of which, “Blame It on the Bassline,” borrowed from another Jacksons tune), Cook formed Beats International. A sort of spiritual successor to Malcolm McLaren’s 1983 album Duck Rock, Beats International was a world-music concept with Cook producing for a loose crew of MCs and singers. The group scored a UK No. 1 by, oddly enough, gluing the Clash and the S.O.S. Band together. “Dub Be Good to Me” paired the “Guns of Brixton” bassline with a lovers-rock cover of the synth-funk epic “Just Be Good to Me.” The Clash were not amused. The subsequent payout was “not as much as they were asking for originally,” Cook noted in retrospect, “but it was more than I had.” The second Beats International album tanked; Cook got divorced. His attorney suggested he declare bankruptcy to keep his Brighton house. His manager got him a gig composing for a Smurfs computer game. The upshot of all this was that unlike other British DJs, Cook largely missed out on rave culture and the first wave of acid. (The “I’ve gotta house” hook on Baby’s pumping “Love Island” was a sly reference to his residency at the infamous Ibiza club Manumission; they were always begging him to play more house music.) His DJ sets were a grab bag of grooves: At one point, he ran a night advertised as “acid free.” Cook would eventually crack. Around 30, he had a transformative experience on E. He bought a Roland TB-303 and worked tirelessly to learn its idiosyncrasies. But it was just one more tool for his kit. His signature became happy house tunes with leftfield samples. Mighty Dub Katz’s “Magic Carpet Ride” swiped its chirpy ah-rin-kin-kin-kin hook (recently resurrected by Rico Nasty) from a ’70s Belgian Afro-Cuban LP; a Sesame Street soundtrack album provided the easygoing soul piano girding Pizzaman’s “Sunshine.” “His tools are cutting edge,” enthused The Detroit Free Press about You’ve Come a Long Way Baby. In fact, his setup hadn’t changed much in the last decade: a couple Akai S950 samplers, a 303, an Atari ST computer running Cubase and C-Lab sequencing software, and thousands of records. The album was made entirely at Cook’s beachfront home: the House of Love, an essential after-hours hang for pretty much every DJ in Brighton. With Freak Power defunct, Cook was free to construct a big-beat statement record using all his accumulated experience: his ear for arresting samples, his DJ’s sense of peak time, his knack for pop construction, his 303 mastery, and even his bass playing. He found himself in a sort of flow state. After all the revelers had cleared out, he’d pull a record off the shelf, or tap through a disk of samples, and the possibilities practically presented themselves. The first fruits appeared in early 1998. In January, he hit No. 3 with “Renegade Master 98,” a thunderously hype remix of the late Wildchild’s garage-house masterpiece. The vocal was lifted from A.D.O.R.’s “One for the Trouble,” a ’94 New York rap single. Wildchild had rearranged some lines, but Cook diced them into glossolalia: “Back more the D with the power with the D for the back more the D with the power with the D for the…” At one point, everything drops out except the rapper, pureed into phonemes: the aural equivalent of a b-boy hitting a doubletime jackhammer. February brought his instant-classic remix of Cornershop’s “Brimful of Asha.” The original (which peaked at No. 60) was an indie-rock salute to Indian playback singers, a genial stroll that recalled “Sweet Jane.” Cook fancied the tune but didn’t think it would pass muster in a Boutique set: The tempo was too slow, and there was no bassline. He sped up the track, shifted the key, and played up the line “Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow.” He also deployed a new favorite trick: chaining two distinct drum samples to give his breaks both deftness and punch. Armed with the Norman Cook Remix, “Brimful of Asha” re-entered the singles chart at No. 1, dethroning Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On.” Skint was starting to worry that Cook was contracting all his good ideas out. But there were even bigger hooks in his box. Auditioning a set of bootlegs he bought in London, he came across Camille Yarbrough’s “Take Yo’ Praise.” It was the sampler’s dream: 20 seconds of unaccompanied soul singing. He draped it over a down-home piano figure pulled from a Hoyt Axton outtake. “Praise You”—Fatboy Slim’s only UK No. 1—became the album’s emotional reset: a Sunday-morning comedown with a disco clop that was both Balearic and baggy. It was also catnip to sports broadcasters, thanks largely to Yarbrough’s communal lyric: “We’ve come a long, long way together/Through the hard times and the good.” By contrast, “Right Here, Right Now” had no time to reminisce. It began as an exercise in making a “string tune”—Cook was inspired by a DJ Mag readers’ poll naming Massive Attack’s “Unfinished Sympathy” the best club track ever. But Massive Attack’s string arrangement was full, live, and stately—a goddess moving over the face of the waters. Cook’s arrangement, lifted from a James Gang psych-rock ballad, was like a torrential rainstorm on the pitch. With its cop-knock of a kick drum and a finger-jabbing hook nicked from an Angela Bassett movie, the tune had an unrelenting urgency. As such, it heralded a new breed of jock jam: minor-key bangers that don’t get the blood pumping as much as the lactic acid. At times, Cook was like a pro hooper playing HORSE: making layups interesting by hitting them from odd angles. He could have cashed out “Soul Surfing” after plopping a breakbeat over the Northern soul source material. But he goosed it with his crispiest 303 tweaks—at one point, the whole thing threatens to become a drum’n’bass track—and dispatched a babbling, backmasked samba vocalist to crash the party. “You’re Not From Brighton” suggested a DJ Muggs new jack swing production, with faint traces of “Insane in the Brain” crushed under the Humvee tread of the drums. The titular boast was an interpolation of a misheard lyric from an Italian house track. It was meant sardonically—“No one is from Brighton,” Cook once joked—but alternating with a sample barking that “funk is the U-UK,” it felt like a thrown gauntlet. But it was more like a handoff. The low-riding electro of “Kalifornia” was Cook’s tribute to his West Coast counterparts, people like the Bassbin Twins, the Crystal Method and DJ Shadow—anyone “mashing up breakbeats the wrong way, ” as he put it. He took a 1983 freestyled rap-show promo and stacked the cadence until it became Latin freestyle; he took a phrase from a Joan Rivers comedy album (“California is druggy druggy druggy”) and vocoded it into a bugged-out hook. In “Gangster Trippin,” he made a more explicit nod to DJ Shadow, borrowing a CL Smooth ad-lib from Shadow’s 18-minute beat suite “Entropy.” But Cook was not remotely as self-serious as Shadow; he was just as happy making the “right” move (pairing the CL sample with soul fanfare) as the “wrong” one (chasing that pairing with chipper rocksteady). He was more cautious when it came to promotion. Cook was always up for a candid print profile or fake boxing match, but hated being on television. Fortunately, he had an army of music-video directors willing to work around him. Roman Coppola turned “Gangster Trippin” into a Zabriskie Point tribute by exploding a house, room by room, in slo-mo. Hammer & Tongs made “Right Here, Right Now” a CGI sidescroller depicting the whole of human evolution, from prehistoric organism to the large king on the album’s UK cover. And for “Praise You,” Spike Jonze played a committed yet hapless b-boy leading an amateur troupe in a guerilla-style performance outside a movie theater. A microbudget video at the peak of major-label bloat, depicting a cringe flash mob before either flash mobs or cringe was a concept, “Praise You” was a massive hit. (In 2001, MTV.com voters named it the best music video of all time.) Jonze’s clip helped nudge the song into the U.S. Top 40—Fatboy Slim’s only appearance to date. (Flush with new royalties, Camille Yarbrough began sending Cook Christmas cards.) Four days after the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards—which saw Cook “perform” the track, dutifully pawing at a grand piano while Jonze and company jumped about in white robes like the Polyphonic Spree on E—You’ve Come a Long Way Baby was certified platinum. By that point, big beat was becoming an echo. In the UK, the nimbler 2-step garage became the new pop pleasure center. In the States, it was advertisers—not labels—keeping big beat on life support: A 2001 Mitsubishi commercial turned the Wiseguys’ 1998 single “Start the Commotion” into a hit, while a Nike campaign did the same for Junkie XL’s 2002 remix of Elvis Presley’s “A Little Less Conversation.” Though some Stateside alt-rock acts dabbled in big beat, no one was ’avin it quite like Fatboy Slim: Nu-metal and rap-rock became the prime consumers of breaks. American critics turned their eyes to Moby, whose 1999 smash Play was another marketer-beloved electronica record using leftfield samples, featuring a killer big-beat single with amateur dancers in the music video. But it was all the same to Cook, who had found his definitive alter ego. Fatboy Slim had merged with Norman, like a symbiote, to form a superstar DJ. In 2002, the second edition of the Big Beach Boutique—a free Fatboy show on the Brighton seashore—drew a quarter-million partiers. It was very nearly a catastrophe. But a DVD of the show became a bestseller in Brazil; in 2004, Fatboy Slim played to an estimated 360,000 people in Rio. His recorded output slowed to a trickle, while a new generation of plunderers reproduced big beat’s thrills with wildly varying levels of effort. On the one hand, there were the internet-native mashup artists who made “Dub Be Good to Me” look like the Avalanches. On the other hand, there were, well, the Avalanches, who assembled a monolith from charity-shop vinyl on 2000’s Since I Left You, arguably the last great big-beat album. In the early 2010s, Cook finally caved to his label’s demands and purchased Ableton. But as he suspected, the possibilities were paralyzing: The technology had come a longer way than he. “I would go in to make a record with one drum machine, a couple of synths that I knew really well, and some loops and samples that I had,” he told Synth History in 2022. “Those were my parameters… how inventive you can be with what you’ve got.” Thirty years after the first Heavenly Social, musicians are still trying their hand at big beat body movin’. But no one’s done it better than Fatboy Slim on a yellowing computer, chasing a Sunday buzz in the House of Love. Additional research by Deirdre McCabe Nolan and Matthew Bliss.

J. Mamana,For Every Set of Eyes,7.4,Rock,"I have never put on a record because I wanted to think of the Siege of Vienna. I have never closed my eyes and thought of Kahlenberg, the mountain, and known that the Ottomans were closing in. I have never put on a record because I wanted to think of Henry James’ Turn of the Screw. I don’t know why anyone puts on a record. I do know that music often sounds really good when you are in love, and that is a good reason to put on a record. Also, music often sounds really good when you are sad and when you are grieving, and that is a really good reason to put on a record. On his second album, For Every Set of Eyes, J. Mamana considers the Siege of Vienna. He also considers grief. It is a frustrating and beautiful record. Mamana’s music appeals to a bookish set. It asks that you maybe already like Mahler and Bartók. It implies that you might subscribe to the literary journal n+1, where you will find an ad for Mamana’s album in the pages of the newest issue. (Perhaps you will have already read his n+1 essay from last year, about the Ethiopian composer Emahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru.) It is tricky to be so expressly referential in music without being a snore. Mamana’s “It’s Bastille Day,” which is about Bastille Day, includes a particularly jarring François Hollande name-check that doesn’t quite pay off. And For Every Set of Eyes isn’t exactly an easy listen. It demands that you focus and pay attention to how everything swirls together. Somehow, he more or less pulls it off. As was clear from his last record, Nothing New in the West, Mamana is most comfortable writing extraordinarily high-concept songs, some of which are indebted to Beethoven. But his work is also very much in conversation with baroque indie pop composers Koenig and Longstreth. Unlike Longstreth, who wrote a sexy pop song about goblins, or Koenig, who wrote one about eating falafel, Mamana is entrenched in the baroque. He writes impenetrable music that is both deeply rooted in Kabbalah and also about fast food. In “New America,” he sets the Magi and Belshazzar near a Wendy’s. It is kind of like a Van Dyke Parks song, ridiculously ornate, exactly what you would want to hear while riding a cartoon stick horse through Camelot. You might be tempted to write off opener “Genius or Apostle” as vaudeville, pure Sondheim with its melodrama, its sweeping strings, its operatic vocals, and you wouldn’t necessarily be wrong. Mamana encourages and delights in these provocations. Watch this! the song demands in its final two minutes, as Mamana shifts from grandiosity into something absolutely twisted. Its pyrotechnics become a laser light show. It becomes a scenario where you are trying to tell a joke while on acid and just trying to grip onto the floor. You are scared. The strings are compressed, they become electrified, electronic. It’s so weird and twisted you can’t look away. And it is glorious in its commitment to being just that: weird. It ends with a choir. This is what makes For Every Set of Eyes special and good almost in spite of itself. It is freak music and it is not self-conscious about it. It forgoes any ambition to be “cool.” The saxophones that split “Years of Lead” in two come at a point where Mamana talks about wanting to hold on to someone, tight. The eight-minute long “No Fun” is about death, broken up by Mamana saying “fuck” a bunch. The strings feel like you’re looking down from a bluff, or starring in the video for “Wuthering Heights.” All of the song’s sweeping gestures, its key changes and sudden collapses in form, are underpinned by grief. This is Mamana at his best: when his ambition matches this honesty. There’s a line in “Tenderness Lost,” weird and real and true, that encapsulates this perfectly: “Basic and basically alive,” he sings. In other words: real as fuck, beautiful, alone, painful.",0,"August 27, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/j-mamana-for-every-set-of-eyes/
Arooj Aftab,Night Reign,8.3,Jazz,"It isn’t easy to say something new with “Autumn Leaves.” The 1945 torch song is surely one of the most performed standards in the jazz repertoire, not only by the likes of Miles Davis and Nat King Cole, but also by the beginners taking lessons in the back rooms of your local store music store: sitting down at a piano to play its wistful minor-key melody is a bit like the jazz version of picking up an electric guitar and going straight for “Smoke on the Water.” Putting your rendition on a new album in 2024 is either a conservative move or a bold one. For Arooj Aftab, the Brooklyn-via-Lahore singer and composer who moves freely between jazz, folk, and Hindustani and Western classical music, it is decidedly the latter. Aftab’s “Autumn Leaves” comes early on Night Reign, her fourth solo album, and renders it as a ghostly incantation. Metallic percussion clatters in the background. Linda May Han Oh’s upright bass lines follow Aftab’s vocal like an elongated shadow follows the protagonist of a noir film. Without a chordal instrument to support it, the familiar tune becomes skeletal and spooky; Aftab’s chromatic embellishments make it spookier. Her take on “Autumn Leaves” is emblematic of the way she works: drawing from tradition while at the same time estranging it, stripping away clichés and stock devices to reveal the mysterious longing that gives the old poems and songs their lasting power. Two of Night Reign’s songs take their words from Mah Laqa Bai Chanda, the 18th-century poet who was the first woman to publish a collection of work in Urdu. Other lyrics are Aftab originals, in both English and Urdu. Still another is based on an offhanded poem that the singer’s friend, the Pakistani actress Yasra Rizvi, posted to Instagram. Aftab unites her source material’s mix of the centuries-old and the ephemeral with her wondrous voice, sometimes soaring but just as potent in its husky lower register. And with her compositions, which patiently gather and dissolve, favoring long arcs of development over sudden dynamic shifts. Though Night Reign has plenty of distinct zones—grungy bass guitar takes the lead on “Bolo Na”; Auto-Tune drapes Aftab’s voice on “Raat Ki Rani”—as a whole it can have the feeling of a single sweeping piece of music. Aftab, who produces her albums herself, deserves as much credit for her composing and arranging as she does for her singing. Night Reign’s palette is similar to Vulture Prince, her 2021 breakout album, and features many of the same players along with a few new ones: harpist Maeve Gilchrist, whose instrument is second only to Aftab’s singing as the signature sound of her music; Aftab’s Love in Exile bandmates, jazz piano star Vijay Iyer and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily; guitarists Kaki King and Gyan Riley; flautist Cautious Clay; percussionist Jamey Haddad; an unlikely Wurlitzer cameo from Elvis Costello. Their instruments drift like a breeze of dandelion seeds, in the same general direction but with independent and unpredictable paths between one point and another. Even Moor Mother, whose stentorian spoken-word is one of the most distinctive sounds in left-of-center music, becomes just another element of the melange when she arrives to deliver a guest verse on “Bolo Na,” the percussive edges of her delivery swept up in the song’s half-time rhythmic churn. Though actual percussion remains sparse, Night Reign grooves harder than its predecessor, which featured almost no drums. Even when the rhythm instruments sit back, there’s almost always a sense of an insistent pulse, an effect that’s especially pronounced on opener “Aey Nehin”: an acoustic guitar carries it, then a harp, then some hand percussion—all sharing the responsibility for keeping up momentum, tossing it back and forth, and dancing a little more freely when it’s someone else’s turn to hold it down. (Whether or not he’s a direct influence on Aftab, Gyan Riley’s father Terry, the master minimalist composer, sometimes comes to mind in moments like these.) On “Last Night Reprise,” a setting of an English translation of a poem by Rumi, Petros Klampanis’ bass is the lone pace-keeper, pressing on with a simple ostinato as the rest of the players wander into clamorous free improv during the instrumental middle section. They cohere again behind Aftab when she returns to the mic for the thrilling finale. “Last night my beloved was like the moon,” she sings, alternating between heroic long tones and frantic rushes of syllables. “So beautiful like the moon.” Vulture Prince, which Aftab recorded in the aftermath of her younger brother’s death, is an album haunted by grief. Night Reign is less tethered to a single theme: Aftab originally conceived it as a collection of settings of Mah Laqa Bai Chanda’s work, then abandoned the idea when it began to feel constrictive. But if there’s one situation or emotion that persists across its songs—even “Autumn Leaves”—it is loving someone who isn’t there. It’s in the words, whether adapted from 18th-century poetry or an Instagram post, and in the mixture of tenderness and tough resolve that characterizes Aftab’s singing. It’s also in the music itself, in the vaporous way the instruments hover around some unspoken center, drawing as much attention to the negative space as the sound, and in the pulse that seems to keep going even when you can’t actually hear it. Almost anyone can relate to the feeling Night Reign renders in sound: the object of your affection may be gone, but the memories and desire that linger on are just as real.

Duster,In Dreams,7.1,Rock,"Cult status tends to flatten its subjects, rendering them as two-dimensional objects permanently sandwiched like fossils by the mounting strata of time and taste. Just consider so many of the private-press or new-age obscurities that returned to attention through the loving efforts of reissue labels and online enthusiasts during the past quarter century; so often, their veneration hinges more on their creators’ past work (and, frequently, its prescience) than who they have become or what they’re doing now. The implicit message? Be who you were, not are. For their part, and so far, Duster have navigated this position nobly. Since the wonderfully opaque and subdued California trio faded back into existence in 2018, when a rising tide of streaming numbers helped prompt an indispensable box set from Numero Group, Duster made two very good records, essentially doubling their commercial output in three years. They gently brightened and occasionally toughened their space-rock and slowcore hymns, once so fragile they seemed like very old skeletons. Like Stratosphere and Contemporary Movement before them, those new LPs felt like collections of bittersweet 45s the band remembered they had stashed in the basement, dust permanently lodged into the grooves. Duster sang about the present—desire and disappointment, brightness and ennui—amid slight updates on the sounds of their past. That’s sometimes the best bargain a band excavated from the crates can get. But Duster’s second phase has now lasted longer than their first; their cross-country run this fall marks nearly six years since they stepped back onstage. This feels like the time when Duster should move definitively beyond their legacy, or when the novelty of becoming a band salvaged by Spotify (and, later, TikTok) must give way for some definitive newness. Released without warning in late August, In Dreams makes no such gambit. Its 13 songs of love and disgust mostly hinge upon the cosmic drift and slow-motion amble that made their early work so enchanting and enduring. The scowl and sway of “Close to Home,” the gentle sweep of “Quiet Eyes,” the quiet roar of “Baking Tapes”: It is absolutely prime Duster, so spot-on it all suggests they may never actually expand upon what that phrase means. However enjoyable In Dreams is, it seems that Duster have forever accepted that two-dimensional version of themselves. The best moments on In Dreams are the ones that surprise you, that remind you that this is a new album and not another set of salvaged castoffs. “Like a Movie” is a nice-enough song, its simple riff sparkling beneath a patina of fingerprints and underlining its accusations like a wink. “What are you gonna tell all your friends?” Canaan Dove Amber sings, voice as faint as the flicker of a faraway lantern. “Just making up shit for kicks.” But then the band goes nearly silent, with muted pedal whirrs and repeating notes segueing into lonely strums of ragged chords. In a song about never going home, it’s as if Amber’s testing out the feeling of real loneliness, a deliberate pairing of form and function that is almost novel given Duster’s nonchalance. The middle of “Poltergeist” works in a similar way. A classic Duster tale about the lies we tell one another, the accusatory lullaby slips eventually into a rivulet of static dotted by a faint keyboard melody. It is the feeling of holding onto reality, even if you know what you believe might not actually be real or right. These bits suggest that Duster are searching for other ways to illustrate their sad and sweet tales, staying true to the ragtag charm of their archive but not necessarily its structure. These, though, are the exceptions that prove the past largely rules here, which is not to say In Dreams is bad. “Quiet Eyes” is a lovely bedtime lullaby, its patient chords and insistent rhythm like a heart rate coming to rest. Amber coos a lover into dreams, his voice curling like a sleepy smile. Above a spring-loaded beat and the twinkle of a Rhodes keyboard, Clay Parton sings during “Black Lace” as if he’s trying to disappear behind the sound, a repetitive guitar lick swiping across the mix like it’s covering for him. This ineffable sense that Duster are perpetually in the act of vanishing has always been one of their primary lures. It remains effective. Though not their best song, “Inside Out,” from Stratosphere, became Duster’s biggest hit (nearly 13 billion TikTok streams) because it pulls outsized emotions into a small space, 140 ragged seconds that somehow contain a lifetime of tumult. Twice as long, the instrumental wonder “Cosmotransporter” is similar, a cycle of tension and release that holds a world of frustration and redemption, anxiety and exhalation within a tight window. Think M83, pulling the shades on the city to record in some drab suburban living room. Last year, in celebration of Stratosphere’s 25th anniversary, Numero Group shot a copy into space. On YouTube, you could watch it leave behind its earthbound gray day and rise above the clouds, sun glinting at the camera's edge. It was a funny little stunt for a record that achieved proverbial liftoff nearly 20 years after it was made, once a new generation stumbled upon its wealth of lo-fi glories online. Why not the sky, then? It didn’t attain orbit, of course, so you could watch it come back down, too, returning through the clouds and over an endless expanse of farmers’ fields before sending rabbits scurrying as it hurtled toward the earth. In Dreams isn’t at all a crash-landing, but it is a soft one, as Duster settle into a perception of themselves rather than fly above it.

Katy Perry,143,4.5,Pop/R&B,"What a weird time to be Katy Perry. Her music career has been in decline since 2017’s Witness, yet from 2018, she made a reported $25 million (at least) for each of the seven seasons that she judged the once-mighty talent show American Idol. This year, pop fans on social media trashed the string of singles she released in advance of her seventh album, 143. Chart positions suggest the broader listening public is, at minimum, apathetic. And yet, she performed a well-received medley of her greatest hits just weeks ago at the MTV Video Music Awards and turned out a triumphant performance in front of a rapturous sea of people at Rock in Rio the night of 143’s release. The crowd sang along loudly even to the critically reviled single “Woman’s World.” Drifting through the winds of popular culture and probably wanting to start again at least occasionally, it seems reasonable to assume that in 2024, Katy Perry feels like a plastic bag. It’s dumbfounding that at this critical juncture in her career, 143 is the record she is releasing. Despite reuniting with writer-producer Dr. Luke in an ostensible search for past glory, 143 sounds phoned in. The material here is so devoid of anything distinguishing that it makes one suspicious it’s a troll or cynical attempt for the campy realm of so bad it’s good. No stranger to a thrashing, Perry might as well have transformed into a fish, jumped into a barrel, and told critics, “Shoot me!” Regardless of intent, it’s possible to read this album as a metatext on the disposability of so much pop. 143 is Perry saying, “Nothing matters,” except instead of a “lol” preceding it, it’s a heart-hand emoji. Rather than wondering what went wrong for Perry, it might be more useful to momentarily ponder what went right. At her peak, she had the kind of imperial phase that only an elite cadre of pop artists get to experience. Perry’s most remarkable stat is that she was the first artist since Michael Jackson to send five songs from the same album to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her third album (but second as Katy Perry), 2010’s Teenage Dream, cemented her image: colorful enough to appeal to children, zany but not so much that it ever challenged, rangey and resilient in voice, and, perhaps most crucially, a writer of certified tunes. And that’s kind of…it? While Perry does make implicit sense as a pop singer, describing why she was as big as she was is a challenge. As a key feature, she sometimes cites her own weirdness, as she did in the acceptance speech for her Video Vanguard Award. But Katy Perry is weird like Olive Garden is exotic: not really at all, and everything is suffocated in cheese. You sometimes get the feeling that there’s a disconnect between who Perry actually is and how she comes off, which is a fatal flaw in these branded times. Fourteen years ago, critic Ann Powers, in a Los Angeles Times review of Teenage Dream, referred to Perry’s “essential hollowness” matter of factly, as if it were part of the price of admission. But Perry could only be essentially hollow for so long—you get about three albums to say precisely nothing as a top-tier artist whose craft isn’t defined by technical virtuosity. The approachable, adorkable, decently voiced Perry could sense as much—it’s why her first Trump-presidency era release, Witness, was touted by her as “purposeful pop.” The world failed to see the purpose. Well, who needs purpose anyway? Time to pivot again. Perry’s 143 is, by her own estimation, “just a fun record…it’s not that deep.” A product of the California woo-woo ways of a woman who claims to check her horoscope like other people check the weather, 143 is named after Perry’s “angel number.” (“It’s just a little message from the universe that says, ‘I love you, I got you girl. You’re gonna be ok. I want the best for you,” she explained recently.) It’s also vintage pager-speak for “I love you.” On the heels of back-to-back flops, the aforementioned Witness and 2020’s Smile, telling the world “I love you” could read as evolved or desperate, but, as she says, it’s not that deep. 143 is Perry’s first album after the birth of her child, Daisy, and a few of the songs project unconditional maternal love with a vagueness that aspires to universality. Dr. Luke is here on 10 of 143’s 11 tracks, alongside Perry for the first time since 2013’s Prism. In a 2017 deposition, Perry said that she suspended her collaboration with Dr. Luke on Witness “because working with him at this moment…would not be received well.” Among alleged offenses, Luke had been accused of rape by another close collaborator, Kesha. But Luke’s defamation case against Kesha was settled in 2023, and even before that, his production on post-allegation hits like Doja Cat’s “Say So” and Latto’s “Big Energy” clearly did not deter listeners. In reuniting with Luke, maybe Perry was gambling on faulty public memory or maybe she was just desperate. Who knows if Dr. Luke would have raised such ire if the album—or at least the lead single and “satirical” female-empowerment anthem, “Woman’s World”—were of “Say So” or “Big Energy” quality. They aren’t. The songs are largely boilerplate pop-trap and EDM that could have come out any time in the past 15 years or so. Perry characterized the album as “a dance-pop record,” then suggested that she could cross making one off her bucket list, as if that wasn’t essentially what she was doing all along. That’s not quite enough of a concept at a time when dance-pop is once again de rigueur, especially when the ensuing material is so frivolous, repetitive, and devoid of joy. 143 is a very confident album, but after one highly scrutinized flop and an entirely ignored one (which is more tragic?), said confidence is misplaced and comes without real swagger. There’s nothing about Perry’s voice that suggests she’s right for an album of straight dance music, even if that's not exactly what 143 is—she’s prone to Broadway-ish belting with the slightest, whitest vibrato and emotionally, there’s a consistent edge to Perry’s voice that often sounds angry or stressed. The causal rage paired well with the guitars that characterized her early hits and gradually evaporated from her sound. How little Perry has to say is stunning. Four decades of female experience (and six writers) yield generic girl-power sentiment like: “Sexy, confident/So intelligent/She is heaven-sent/So soft, so strong.” Perry sings “Woman’s World” with the deliberateness English speakers use when trying to convey something to someone who doesn’t speak the language. When she does weave evocative imagery, the vibes are off. “Say the right thing, maybe you can be/Crawlin’ on mе like a centipedе,” is supposed to be a come-on in the horny “Gimme Gimme” but yuck, who wants bugs in their bed? “Lifetimes,” whose rolling pianos are supposed to evoke rave but end up sounding like slightly sped up Rhye, pays tribute to her daughter in a string of choruses that all say the same thing: “I’ll love you for life,” “I’m gonna love you till the end,” and “Baby you and me for infinity.” The tension-and-release low end of the track yields not drops but gentle puts. This is kiddie-coaster EDM. Weird momentary echoes of past songs rattle around 143, like Luke and company are blindly rummaging around a junk drawer of pop music: Kelly Clarkson’s “Catch My Breath,” Duran Duran’s “Come Undone,” Daft Punk’s “Too Long,” Pet Shop Boys “Paninaro” are all consciously or unconsciously referenced briefly. On “I’m His, He’s Mine,” there is a rather pronounced invocation of Crystal Waters’ “Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless),” which is both an obvious wagon-hitching to one of the great all-time no-brainer floor fillers, and a squandered opportunity as the slowed-down sample over yet another hip-hop inflected broken beat smothers its dance factor. The guests here—Kim Petras, Doechii, JID, and 21 Savage—seem at best obliged, at worst blackmailed. Max Martin nabs a co-production credit on the Petras-featuring “Unholy” rip-off “Gorgeous,” and it has not a lick of that special Martin spice. 21 Savage drops some of his worst-ever bars, which is actually a feat given his record, but at least his contribution deprives Perry of being responsible for 143’s worst lines, though barely—in the “E.T.” rip-off about A.I., she sings, “I’m just a prisoner in your prison.” Like Witness, 143 is a spectacular flop, but it’s a strange one—like one of those restaurants that looks nice and has an expensive menu but serves food so mid as to be insulting. It’s worse than awful. At least awful is something you can direct your rage at, deriving catharsis in the process. Aside from some fleeting hellacious decisions, like the jump scare of a warbling child’s voice that opens the cloying final track “Wonder,” 143 is mostly just…there. The flop cycle is a hard thing to get out of. For one thing, popularity begets popularity. Absent that kind of momentum, a dimmed star needs a once-in-a-career single like “We Belong Together” or “What’s Love Got to Do With It” to shake her from her funk. 143 has no such undeniable classic. So now what? Consider what occurs to one’s sense of self when universal praise dries up—that kind of identity-dissolution is woven into 143’s chintzy fabric. One day you’re ablaze, burning yourself into corneas the world over. Then you’re just a smoky outline of what you once were. And then you’ve disappeared entirely. Just like a firework.

Willow,empathogen,6.8,Rock,"Sitting in the backless hot seat of NPR’s Tiny Desk earlier this month, Willow seemed more uninhibited and confident than ever. That’s a change of pace for an artist who’s existed under the harsh microscope of celebrity her entire life. But here, backed by bass, guitar, piano, and drums, she swayed and beamed like no one was watching. She “just wants to feel it and be in the vibe,” Willow said on a call beforehand, a predictably heady desire that nonetheless suited the band’s sleek renditions of old and new songs. They gave the peppy twang of her 2015 megahit “Wait a Minute!” a sloping, jazzy remix falling somewhere between Alanis Morissette and Esperanza Spalding, and they sanded down the light pop-punk edges of her cathartic 2022 ballad “Split,” putting more emphasis on her breathy falsetto. But a version of “symptom of life,” a single from her new album empathogen, best illuminated the next phase in Willow’s evolution. Over crawling bass riffs, drums, and siren-like guitar, Willow articulated ideas about pain and anxiety she’s been picking at her whole career: “It’s like a turtle in the sand/Making way to the ocean/Almost meeting the end/Because the birds are in motion.” On empathogen, she follows suit, keeping things poetic without getting too sappy, staring mortality in the face while she begins the musical healing process in earnest. Willow’s musical and philosophical wanderlust over the last nine years has been exhausting—Annunaki-referencing neo-soul, Travis Barker-indebted pop-punk, empowerment-core odes to feeling feelings and rocking out. She’s never been short on ideas, but even the best of her earlier work lands like freehand graffiti writing; colorful and expressive, sure, but often lacking the focus and precision of stenciled graf. empathogen is the closest she’s come to not just channeling but harnessing the rawness of self-acceptance in young adulthood. It’s her most mature and well-rounded offering yet, though her writing can sometimes be as surface-level as an abandoned tweet draft. The punk and metal influences of her last two albums have been pushed to the margins by a more ambitious fusion: “jazz, funk, and a little bit of pop,” as she recently told Vogue Australia, along with Indian raga, what she calls the “indigenous, ceremonial vibes” of Native American throat singing, and Gregorian chant. This hybrid gives shapes to the sprawling “false self,” which combines funky bass, deep drum blasts, and stacked vocals that swell and contract like the vague panic attack Willow describes in its hook. “I wanna crash, feel so attacked/On a mad dash in my own brain… Am I insane? Feel the answer change each day,” she sings, the music doing much of the heavy lifting. Thankfully, there are no treatises on phone addiction and only a few pie-in-the-sky paeans to spirituality on empathogen. But Willow’s lyrics often lean on bland aphorisms that gesture at emotional reconciliation instead of actually going there. “Don’t ask questions/When life’s expressing/Itself through you and speaking the truth,” she reads from your aunt’s latest Facebook post on “between i and she.” Album closer “b i g f e e l i n g s” has a chorus that begins, “I have such big feelings”; it sounds ripped from a rejected High School Musical: The Musical: The Series script. These had me longing for more moments like “‘i know that face.’,” where the pep talk she gives herself for running from her darkest thoughts is as urgent as its staccato delivery and syncopated jazz ensemble production. Much of empathogen’s music, all of which is self-produced, is gorgeous and well arranged, jumping between proggy pop fusion and potent bursts of free jazz. Even when the words feel disposable, the textures of the backing tracks are rich and inviting. “no words 1 & 2,” a co-production with Eddie Benjamin, runs its bass and drums at the same pace as Willow’s scatting, giving Bobby McFerrin vibes with the brevity of a Destroy Lonely leak. Amalgams like this are leagues more interesting than the handful of occasions where homage slips into pantomime. “pain for fun,” a collaboration with St. Vincent—one of Willow’s favorite artists—is too keen to emulate Actor and Masseduction-era Vincent instead of bringing Annie Clark into Willow’s world. The gauzy bass and slinky vocals on “down” sound more than a little like demos from Lianne La Havas’ 2020 self-titled album. For an album centered on self-acceptance, some rely too heavily on their influences, obscuring Willow’s voice in the process. In a recent interview with Billboard, Willow called empathogen her “first grown-up album,” citing recent experiences with psychoactive drugs and a desire to escape nepo-baby classification as the impetus to make her first Serious Musician album. It’s certainly her most expansive and musically refined project to date, bringing a deeper appreciation for songwriting, arranging, and producing to the airy atmosphere of 2017’s The 1st and 2019’s Willow. Her lyrics haven’t gotten much stronger, but her boundless enthusiasm holds things together more than usual. The refrain, “Acceptance is the key/Acceptance gives me wings,” which powers “b i g f e e l i n g s,” might look generic on paper, but delivered in lilting falsetto within a psychedelic jazz maelstrom, Willow feels like she’s singing to her most important audience: herself.

Norah Jones,Come Away With Me,7.5,Jazz / Pop/R&B,"Norah Jones, cradling an armful of gold, spoke sheepishly at the 2003 Grammys. The 23-year-old singer-songwriter had just swept the lauded Big Four categories for her debut album, Come Away With Me; over the previous year, her gentle rasp of a voice floated out of seemingly every Starbucks, wine tasting room, and parents’ CD changer. Yet the nascent star, with her fresh-faced appearance and bounty of dark curls, was visibly stunned by her own success. She could scarcely believe that one of her idols, Aretha Franklin, was sitting front row that night as she performed the album’s doe-eyed lead single, “Don’t Know Why.” Standing so close to a legend she’d grown up listening to sent Jones into a tailspin. “I didn’t expect this,” she said of her winnings that night, “nor did I need it.” Jones was partly right. Come Away With Me had already sold 4 million copies, riding high off the breezy, inescapable “Don’t Know Why,” not to mention an unprecedented marketing push from vaunted jazz label Blue Note. Since the record’s release the previous February, she had sold more records than any other artist in the label’s storied history, including titans like Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis. But Jones’ subdued response to her swift acclaim was genuine. At one point, a rumor arose that she had asked Blue Note boss Bruce Lundvall if they could pull the record from shops to prevent listener burnout. No such luck: The laid-back, preternaturally beautiful Come Away With Me, still Jones’ best album despite its sleepy reputation, struck a singular chord with both the music industry and general public, going on to sell an eye-watering 27 million copies to date. Jones was born in New York City to Sue Jones, an Oklahoma-born nurse and former concert producer, and the celebrated Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar. The pair’s relationship blossomed in the late 1970s, but they split after nine years, and Sue moved with 4-year-old Norah to Grapevine, Texas, a small town northwest of Dallas; Shankar and the family wouldn’t reconcile until Norah was 18. (“All families have their complicated corners,” she said when looking back at the strained relationship in 2020, eight years after Shankar’s death. “It took us all some time to feel comfortable with each other.”) Jones credited her own early interest in music to her mother’s vast record collection, a library that spanned Ray Charles to Pavarotti. Billie Holiday became an early north star; Jones would play her favorite songs from her mother’s eight-disc Holiday compilation on repeat, especially the ambrosial “You Go to My Head.” In early interviews, Jones painted a Norman Rockwell-style portrait of her otherwise “pretty normal” childhood growing up in Texas: “I lived on a little street, had neighbors and they were nice, and we rode our bikes down the street every night till it got dark and your mom called you home for dinner.” She began singing in church choirs by age 7 and later took piano lessons; her mother noticed her melodic aptitude and encouraged her to audition for Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, a school in downtown Dallas that counts Erykah Badu as an alumna. There, Jones studied jazz piano in a vibrant environment full of other artsy kids that she often compared to the film Fame. Her teachers noticed her acumen for vocal stylings; one observed that other students would often try to imitate her loose, graceful improvisations. Jones’ musical education continued at the University of North Texas, where she majored in piano at the school’s prestigious jazz program. At UNT, her art really began to thrive—Jones would study piano by day and go to shows in Denton’s diverse music scene by night, eventually joining a band named Laszlo, after the resistance leader in Casablanca. The songs on Laszlo’s lone recorded album, Butterflies, hint at the bluesy music Jones would assemble for her own debut: On the highlight “Wait,” backed by wending guitar solos, she gives a pleading, ardent performance that presages some of the more feverish songs on Come Away With Me. In 1998, Jones was cruising around in a hulking blue 1971 Cadillac DeVille eight-seater, picking up guitarist and singer-songwriter Jesse Harris from his hotel. Harris was in town from New York to gig and give lessons at the university, and the faculty had asked Jones to scoop up him and his band, including drummer Kenny Wolleson. “That night, we played together on a fairway on the golf course at the hotel. Norah sang some standards—we all thought she was good,” Harris remembered. Jones kept in touch after the band returned to New York, sparking a friendship that would play a pivotal role in her career—Wolleson played on Come Away With Me and Harris penned several of its songs, including “Don’t Know Why.” The summer after her sophomore year Jones moved to New York City in what was meant to be a vacation, subletting a friend’s apartment in Greenwich Village. Instead, she dropped out and stayed put in what she called her “first adult decision.” She liked the thrum of the city, and even enjoyed the way it smelled: “Dirt. Garbage. It’s nostalgic from when I was a kid,” she said. Jones scraped by waiting tables and performing wherever she could, which usually meant $50 gigs at piano bars. It was an early start reminiscent of Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell: rooting around for a star turn on the club circuit while playing to their hearts’ content in the meantime. Jones’ lucky break came in 2000 in the form of a brunch gig where she caught the ear of Shell White, an accounts executive for Blue Note. Taking advantage of label president Lundvall’s so-called “open-door policy” to pitch new music, White brought in Jones’ three-song demo. Blue Note, named for notes played at a slightly lower pitch that add characteristic, wistful grittiness to jazz, was founded in 1939 by German record executive Alfred Lion and writer and musician Max Margulis. The label notched its first notable success with a popular recording of Gershwin’s “Summertime” by saxophonist Sidney Bechet. From there, it began to introduce varied styles of jazz to the record market, from hard bop in its early days to modernist work by artists like Herbie Hancock, Cecil Taylor, and Eric Dolphy. Add in the label’s exceptional art design—era-defining cropped black-and-white photos set alongside geometric typography by designer Reid Miles—and Blue Note quickly grew into a standard-bearer for the genre. Following an upswing through the ’60s and ’70s, Blue Note hit a rough patch going into the next decade. EMI purchased the label, which lay dormant for some time until Lundvall arrived. Having signed Bobby McFerrin to the parent label, the new exec hoped to finesse Blue Note out of its creaky era with more acts capable of “crossing over” to reach soul, rock, and pop listeners—an increasingly important strategy for jazz labels looking to get out of the red. Jones, it turned out, was just the ticket; when he heard her demo, Lundvall instantly decided to sign her. “I just stopped in my tracks,” he remembered. “When you hear a voice that has that kind of engaging power, it just draws you right in.” When Shell White told Jones she wanted to introduce her to Lundvall, Jones simply laughed. “It seemed like an impossible dream,” she said. Nearly a year later, Jones became the youngest artist on the Blue Note roster, despite an offer to sign to the pop-leaning sister label Manhattan. “I didn’t want to be on a pop label, because I know what comes with that,” she would later explain to Rolling Stone. “I didn’t want to make videos. I didn’t want to be expected to sell millions of records. I didn’t ever want to be a celebrity.” Jones’ first attempt at recording her debut didn’t even pan out. Recording take after take dispirited her; she found it exceedingly difficult to summon any kind of spontaneity, even while working alongside her familiar trio that included Harris and her then-boyfriend, bassist Lee Alexander. Lundvall gave her another chance, this time enlisting veteran producer Arif Mardin. Known for his work with superstars like Franklin, Dusty Springfield, and Chaka Khan, Mardin brought a deft hand to Come Away With Me, even if Jones was intimidated by his résumé. “Apparently, before we met she said, ‘How can I tell him when I disagree with him?’” Ardin remembered later. “But we just added little touches. Organ chords here, strings on one track. We recorded the old way: People played, people sang, lots of eye contact.” The “old way” worked. Come Away With Me is tender and low-lit, a cocktail of tuneful mid-tempo blues balladry and country-soul that soars with the easy, weightless determination of a gull. For every assured cover song, like Jones’ hip-swinging version of Hank Williams’ “Cold Cold Heart” or her late-night, besotted take on Hoagy Charmichael’s “The Nearness of You,” she issues a slight nudge in another, unexpected direction. “Feelin’ the Same Way” ambles along with a buoyant bluegrass gait, while an accordion sneaks in behind her on the dreamy “Painter Song.” “Lonestar,” the most overtly Texan song on the record, adds a soupçon of slide guitar, which moves around her luminous, multi-tracked voice like a dance companion. Later, on the gorgeous “The Long Day Is Over,” a downy-soft brushed snare, piano, and low-slung guitar played by the great Bill Frisell guide Jones’ zigzagging vocals. Her voice swirls into maze-like melodies, rambling from a low whisper to a throaty call. And “Don’t Know Why,” Jones’ most popular song, captures the impulsivity she sought; the version included on the album uses her first vocal take. It arcs and moves with calming clarity, like an especially beautiful sunrise filtering through the trees. Come Away With Me isn’t all unfussy easy listening. “I’ve Got to See You Again,” written by Harris, has lyrics that suggest an unhealthy attachment to an erotic dancer: “Lines on your face don’t bother me/Down in my chair when you dance over me,” Jones murmurs over a Fiona Apple-esque mixture of leisurely piano and a keening, unsettling violin. “I could almost go there/Just to watch you be seen.” She leaned further into sensuality on the title track, dashed off in “10 or 15 minutes” on an acoustic guitar she’d sent for from back home in Texas. Its opening verses sound as though she’s whispering to you from beneath the sheets: “Come away with me in the night/Come away with me and I will write you a song,” she offers. With its gently rising chorus, the tune remains one of the best showcases for the earthy luxury of Jones’ voice. Upon the album’s release in February 2002, Blue Note marketed Come Away With Me with a blitz of press. They shipped thousands of copies to be sold at coffee shops, spas, and vineyards, aiming directly at the over-21 crowd. “Time, Newsweek, getting it played in Starbucks—people need to hear about a record,” Blue Note marketing director Zach Hochkeppel noted at the time. “They may not buy a lot of albums, but when they do, they become a hugely dedicated fanbase…. It was turbo word of mouth.” Reviews were positive, with several critics drawing comparisons to Diana Krall and Rickie Lee Jones, artists who similarly balanced jazzy inspirations with soul, Americana, and pop. The album debuted at No. 139 but only climbed from there: Jones’ music performed well on small-town radio, appearing on jazz and college stations and NPR. It helped somewhat that she arrived in the wake of another piano prodigy, Alicia Keys, whose debut had shifted many millions of units just a year earlier (and who would present Jones with her Best New Artist trophy at the Grammys). But Jones’ smoky, soft rock approach took gradual, almost uncontrollable hold over listeners. By August, the album had gone platinum. Part of the record’s success can be attributed to a cultural pushback against the industry’s rabid appeals to youth-oriented music: teen pop, rap-rock, and hip-hop were still the main event. Jones’ album, meanwhile, with its soft-focus, adult-contemporary bent, inspired nostalgia in older listeners and suggested a refreshing integrity to curious younger ones. But Jones and her affiliation with Blue Note were met with opprobrium from genre purists, too: “It Ain’t Jazz, Despite the Label,” sneered a Wall Street Journal headline about Come Away With Me’s runaway success, though Jones herself was at pains to assure the public that she thought the same. “I’m very open about this record [not being] really a jazz record,” she explained to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram a month after its release. “I think it’s probably because I come from being a jazz musician, hanging out with jazz musicians and hearing them and myself say, ‘Oh, that’s good, but it’s not jazz.’ That sort of mentality sort of carried over, and I’m sort of quick to say it’s not jazz because I don’t want them to say, ‘That’s not jazz!’” As she gained popularity, Jones began to feel the pressure from all sides. In June, she refused to let EMI release a chintzy “Don’t Know Why” remix amped up with a computer-generated drumbeat and reverb. She sometimes bristled with the press, especially once her connection to Shankar became more widely known. Lundvall insisted he wasn’t aware Shankar was Jones’ father before he signed her, and the fact wasn’t acknowledged in press kits. Annoyed with the scrutiny, Jones tried to deflect reporters’ questions about her family life, a topic on which she remains exceedingly private. In an interview with The Guardian that September, after insisting that any questions about her family be submitted in writing, she explained her reasoning: “Although I love my dad very much, I did only spend a fraction of my adolescence around him. This is probably why I try to downplay our relationship in the press. When misquotes start flying around, inevitably someone’s feelings get hurt, and I didn’t get into music to have family business printed in the press. I love my dad, and I think he’s a brilliant musician.” She finished off with a clarifying sentence: “I just want to make my music, and I want it to stand on its own.” Come Away With Me’s blockbuster success had indeed launched Jones’ musical career and helped to restore Blue Note’s fortunes. But by October, even she was overwhelmed by her own album. “I mean, I’m proud of it,” she explained. “But I’m totally sick of it. I wanna see an end to this record… I’m not complaining. But I really did not sign up for this.” She had to move house after the New York Post published a photo of her apartment building and fans camped outside. Once the Grammy nominations rolled around and Jones was up for eight awards, her visibility hit its peak. She balanced feeling blessed with feeling overrun. Jones’ unexpected Grammy night, netting five trophies in total, introduced Come Away With Me to a still wider audience, even as some critics called her “terribly over-rewarded” and predicted that the hyper-exposure would jinx subsequent projects. The album spent four weeks at No. 1 nearly a year after release, a stat that seems almost unbelievable today. Jones, for her part, remained poised in the face of newfound stardom. When asked at the Grammys what she planned next, she announced, “I just keep doing what I’m doing, nothing more. This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. I’m clear on that. My objective is to enjoy this moment and then put it on the side and get on with what I’ve been doing all along, which is to make music.” Jones’ career since has drifted in new directions while retaining her roots in country, rock, and soul. Her follow-up, 2004’s Feels Like Home, scooped up another Grammy for its tasteful, light-handed lead single, “Sunrise.” She nabbed a guest feature from Dolly Parton on the straight-ahead bluegrass standout “Creepin’ In,” a song inspired by Parton’s 1999 LP The Grass Is Blue. Even Jones seemed bemused by the collaboration, as though the whirlwind of her past few years hadn’t happened: “We just thought it would be fun if Dolly came in and sang, and she did!” On subsequent releases, Jones moved between moving polemics against injustice, smoldering Danger Mouse productions, and a collaboration with Outkast. Her latest record, this year’s Visions, is a gentle summation of her long, evolving career: Jones finds room for retro-soul workouts and piano pop in equal measure, with her voice in fine form. Come Away With Me’s singular staying power was a union of circumstance: a shrewd marketing strategy by Blue Note; a demographic moment at which the over-45 audience was becoming the fastest-growing group of music consumers; and the magnetic pull of Jones’ sophisticated yet easygoing music. Her success became a model to future stars who would dabble between pop, soul, jazz, and country—singers like Joss Stone and even Adele found a home on the avenue Jones paved. But her sudden success went unmatched for some time; her Big Four sweep at the Grammys wouldn’t be replicated until another ambitious, soft-spoken upstart, Billie Eilish, arrived in 2020 and achieved the same benchmark. Come Away With Me holds a deep reserve of pathos, even as it quickly assumed a life of its own as so-called coffee house music. Jones’ pacifying drawl and waves of sparse yet resonant instrumentation imbue the album with a warm, captivating radiance that still glows bright. Additional research by Deirdre McCabe Nolan.

Coco & Clair Clair,Girl,7.6,Pop/R&B,"Like a straight-to-Tubi film, lobotomy-pop duo Coco & Clair Clair are low-budget, resourceful, full of comedically high aspirations. They are extremely fun, extremely dumb. Theirs is a performance of bad taste and brainlessness, a reaction and antidote to pseudo-intellectuality. While they grew up listening to John Maus and Bill Callahan in the Atlanta suburbs, the music they’re making now is closer in spirit to the Black Eyed Peas. In Coco & Clair Clair’s world, vapidness is next to godliness. Since at least 2021, when singer and TikToker Chrissy Chlapecka tagged a clip #bimbocore and helped ignite a trend, the popular It Girl has styled herself as an irreverent ditz, a “thot daughter,” a resident of Barbie’s deathless world. This summer, Charli XCX’s BRAT complicated that dominant mode, finding a certain truth behind the performance and edging toward earnestness with songs like “Girl, so confusing” and “I think about it all the time.” With their third album, Girl, Coco & Clair Clair take their barbed quips and cheeky attitude so far that they find their landing place on the other side of irreverence. Girl easily could have met a predictable rom-com ending—a simple taming of the shrew wrap-up—but instead it feels genuinely hard-fought, as though they’ve formed a closer relationship to truth without sacrificing their comedic absurdity. “I’m too rare for Raya, stop inviting me, cucks,” raps Clair Clair on “Kate Spade.” On previous albums the pair were unsentimental and impervious to romance, but on Girl they dare to be tender, even obsequious. They say they’ve recovered discarded lyrics they once deemed too personal to share. One likely suspect: “Do you see me like I want you to see me?/Will you think I’m cool if I watch this movie?” Clair Clair raps nervously on “Gorgeous International Really Lucky.” Girl is also more structurally robust than anything they’ve made before, the production sharper and less self-consciously lo-fi. That’s mostly because they lean unashamedly into pastiche. “Martini” sounds like a cloud rap type beat; “Everyone But You” like Dean Blunt sampling Incubus; “My Girl” like a tribute to Crystal Castles. The broad-strokes approach to musical influences showcases their talent for summoning the ghost of an original, then using bizarrely specific lyricism to tack against its formula. It is so funny to hear, for instance, Coco rap something as plainly ridiculous as “Don’t come yapping with that damn fucking beak” on the Opium-indebted “Bitches Pt. 2.” Whatever style they play with, Coco & Clair Clair have a clear talent for finding its most naive, exuberant aspects. You can hear that best on the album’s main landmark: a breakbeat cover of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s “Our House.” It sounds hilarious (and it is), but it’s also strangely touching. Its uncanny emotional resonance recalls a scene in Xavier Dolan’s Mommy, when the protagonist skates to a “Wonderwall” needle drop and appears to widen the aspect ratio with his hands. “Our House” is Coco & Clair Clair’s widescreen moment—when something initially mistaken for irony deepens into sincerity, the confusion of emotions and cultural associations giving way to an authentic, unblinkered response to the art. On Girl, Coco & Clair Clair display a more sophisticated musical and emotional palette while retaining the charm of bedroom hobbyists. At last, they have everything a woman could possibly want.

LustSickPuppy,CAROUSEL FROM HELL,7.2,Rap,"LustSickPuppy—who makes a madcap meld of punk, digital hardcore, rave, and rap—typically exerts a hyper-confident lusty indignation. It’s not that Tommy Hayes, the mind behind LustSickPuppy (LSP to the heads), doesn’t ever mention romance or melancholy within the turbulence of their mostly self-produced discography, which now totals 27 songs and a tad over 45 minutes, all counted. But all over their debut album CAROUSEL FROM HELL is the image of peeling back: “Peel ya skin back/Peel back all of my layers.” We get one surprising moment of tenderness with an almost sweetly sung “I love you, I love you/I want you to stay,” but as we move along, this peeling works in reverse, the tenderness revealed to be anger, as though to say the deepest of feeling is passionate rage. This is the kind of music you get with or you don’t. It’s hard, it’s fast, it’s ambitious, loud, a maelstrom of genres and references only someone who grew up in Crown Heights going to punk shows and traipsing on the weirder corners of the ’00s internet would want to make. In response to my attempt to explain exactly what LSP does, a friend said “I can’t keep up with the kids.” But in certain circles of a DIY scene that centers harsh noise and breakbeats—such as those familiar with what was once called The Mutants and included Deli Girls, Dreamcrusher, and Kill Alters—LustSickPuppy is royalty. Fans will have lyrics memorized within days of a drop; they’ll bark when ordered to bark. At barely 20 minutes, CAROUSEL is the longest LSP release to date—which I suppose is what makes it an album and not an EP, like 2020’s COSMIC BROWNIE or 2022’s AS HARD AS YOU CAN. It’s COSMIC BROWNIE’s “Graveyard Smash” and AS HARD AS YOU CAN’s “Ego Bruiser” that are key to this world—a world Hayes told Office Mag was built with and for “weird little creatures who like to dance until they die.” The former is a flip on “Monster Mash,” crawling with “Ghouls and goblins, creatures mobbing.” The latter is a sex romp (“This pussy I keep it sticky”) whose zany video features Hayes as a blonde-wigged bodybuilder. There’s always humor. This must be emphasized. CAROUSEL’s final song “Chokehold” rhymes “Tamagotchi” with “Hitachi” and throughout are tongue-in-cheek quips and self-references, giggles and lols. The LSP universe includes but is not limited to: Lil’ Kim and neon clown makeup, Foxy Brown and rhinestones, Bring Me the Horizon and silver spiderweb bras, Death Grips and latex doggy gear. They once, for Halloween, had a prosthetic hand giving the finger made as a mask. Hayes tweets such things as, “I hate being referred to as mother plz instead refer to me as overlord,” and suggests one listen to CAROUSEL plugged into Doc Brown’s enormous amp from the beginning of Back to the Future. A porn site ad-esque gif promo-ing “CHOKEHOLD”: “Are u a Sick Puppy?? LustSickPuppy wants to put YOU in a chokehold. You won’t last 2:07!!!” CAROUSEL is missing the goofy found sounds and allusions and some of the playfulness I so loved about their previous output, but it doesn’t lack for moxie. Hayes floats somewhere between self-drawn cartoon character and dominatrix daddy you’re dying to please. The personality is inextricable from the music, which is breakneck and uncompromising. It’s all ego, but it’s an ego that’s welcoming, not self-centered but self-assured, one that rolls between tender outrage at rigged systems and furious sensuality. Maybe it’s not so surprising, after all, that there’s some sweet-sounding affection tucked into all the chaos.",0,"April 29, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lustsickpuppy-carousel-from-hell/
M Wagner,We Could Stay,7.6,Experimental,"The music that opens M Wagner’s We Could Stay doesn’t fade-up as much as it lumbers into view. It carries a crackling sense of inevitability, as if you’re watching a shelf cloud advance on a city skyline. Suddenly, it’s upon you: An enormous four-chord vamp mangled by distortion and haunted vocal echoes, the song’s shimmering chimes playing around the edges. There’s a seductive elegance to the track’s destruction, like spending your final moments caught in a tornado, marveling at its power. In its last quarter, the noisy layers of “Release Yrself” fall away, leaving the softly glowing embers of a lullaby-like melody. Right when it feels light enough to drift off on the breeze, Wagner brings in a startling, stabbing trance synth, caking it with the blistering overdrive of a tape deck eating itself. We Could Stay, the Brooklyn electronic musician’s staggering debut, artfully oscillates between moments of hypnotic bliss and jarring violence. Wagner keeps his programmed percussion as uncomplicated as possible, stripping house, garage, and techno down to the studs. His work isn’t at all minimal, though; the utilitarian grooves leave plenty of space, which Wagner fills with interlocking loops, infinitely repeating micro samples, and droning synths that shudder and spiral when agitated. There are shades of GAS and the Field here—Wagner’s an avid fan of ambient techno pioneers like Wolfgang Voigt and Biosphere—but rather than stretching towards an ever-distant horizon, his work operates in a much tighter radius. Some of the dreamier textures he employs could be traced back to Silver Liz, the psych-pop band he founded with his wife Carrie in 2016—he even samples Carrie’s vocals from Silver Liz’s “Terrapin” on We Could Stay’s title track. And despite economical run times, each track is a full journey, Wagner gleefully bending dance music tropes into unpredictable shapes. Inspect his wall of sound a little closer, and you’ll discover the thunderous roar cleverly hiding a pop sensibility. One of the key aspects of Wagner’s compositional style is the gradual, almost imperceptible introduction of new elements. He often brings in a sample or instrument through a slow fade, so that by the time it’s prominent in the mix, you’ve forgotten what the song sounded like without it. “Marcy Av” starts with a solitary bass drum, and slowly evolves into a simple, swinging UK garage pattern—more DJ transition tool than album cut. As it shuffles along, a sine wave sequence flickers to life, metallic glitches form a melody, and a splashy breakbeat emerges—all funneling into the final detuned, richly harmonic chord. The ghostly vocal samples on “Never Gone” bubble up so gently, it’s hard to tell if they’re actually there or if your brain’s working to make sense of the song’s cacophonous, shoegazing frequencies. Halfway through “Rome Generator,” you’ll suddenly become aware of the syncopated kicks, but rewind a little, and you’ll discover they’d initially appeared a full minute before, buried beneath a strobing keyboard. Throughout We Could Stay, Wagner pairs these subtle transitions with more traditional, gridlike techno structures, maintaining an alluring dichotomy between the celestial and the grounded. The record loses itself a little near the end, coming down from the neon-streaked jungle climax of “Thanks for Listening” with two ambient pieces that, while gorgeous, tread somewhat similar ground. But for the better part of its 41-minute runtime, We Could Stay is breathlessly thrilling—bruised, beautiful, and completely engulfing.",0,"May 24, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/m-wagner-we-could-stay/
Beth Gibbons,Lives Outgrown,8.0,Experimental,"Beth Gibbons has made inactivity into an art form. In Portishead she sang as if hanging onto the microphone for dear life, her voice the embodiment of languorous misery. Her recorded output since then has arrived at a snail’s pace and her reputation has grown with each fallow year. Following the release of Portishead’s Third, in 2008, Gibbons has performed Górecki’s Symphony No. 3 with the Polish National Radio Symphony, featured on Kendrick Lamar’s “Mother I Sober,” and done precious little else in public. Gibbons does nothing that she doesn't have to and she does it in her own sweet time, which makes the arrival of Lives Outgrown feel like a revelatory occasion. So why did Lives Outgrown bring Gibbons out of her shell? And why now? “People started dying,” she said. Three full decades after Portishead first appeared on the scene, she reintroduces herself with an album inspired by goodbyes, informed by the kind of perspective that’s only possible by looking backward. She added, “When you’re young, you never know the endings, you don’t know how it’s going to pan out.” At the heart of Lives Outgrown is a push and pull between past, present, and future, with Gibbons delving into her personal history for inspiration, while studiously avoiding the palette that made Portishead so beloved. Stylistically, Lives Outgrown approaches folk music, thanks to its acoustic guitars and strings; but it feels denser, louder, and more exploratory, like stumbling across a junkyard deep in the forest. Unusual textures abound: In “Tell Me Who You Are Today,” producer James Ford (of Simian Mobile Disco) strikes piano strings with metal spoons; for another track, he and Gibbons spin whirly tubes over their heads, in search of the perfect creepy tone. Melodies of endless melancholy and lyrics of pointed depth, reminiscent of Gibbons’ work with Portishead and (briefly) Rustin Man, her duo with Talk Talk’s Paul Webb, reflect the singer’s period of self-reflection. Lives Outgrown has moments of crushing relatability, as she tackles subjects like motherhood, anxiety, and menopause, her unvarnished humanity a world away from the otherworldly rage she inhabited on Third. “Without control/I’m heading toward a boundary/That divides us/Reminds us,” she sings on “Floating on a Moment,” striking a beautifully sparse rhythm and tone, while the opening couplet of “Ocean” (“I fake in the morning, a stake to relieve/I never noticed the pain I proceed”) distills years of dull suffering into two elegant lines. Her melodies are strong as iron: The elegantly inevitable “Floating on a Moment” and cathartic album closer “Whispering Love” are among the best songs that Gibbons has put her name to. Gibbons’ voice makes comparisons to Portishead inevitable—and there is, perhaps, a tang of Adrian Utley’s spaghetti western guitar in the opening bars of “Floating on a Moment.” Occasionally, she makes veiled references to her past, with phrases that seem to mirror lines from elsewhere in her catalog. On the whole, though, the singer makes a concerted effort to outrun her musical history. Gibbons said that she wanted to get away from snare drums and breakbeats—both key elements of the Portishead sound—while recording Lives Outgrown, with the drum lines of collaborator Lee Harris (formerly of Talk Talk and a contributor to Gibbons and Rustin Man’s Out of Season) instead hammered out on toms and bass. This percussive roll is complemented by an inconspicuously cosmopolitan mixture of sounds. Unusual groupings of instruments are packed into devious musical layers, like the viscid concoction of bass clarinet, bass, cello, Farfisa, harmonium, recorders, “fuzz flute,” violin, singing tubes, and bowed saw that is daubed over “Beyond the Sun”. This darkly sylvan stew has little of Portishead's cinematic high drama; its abstruse angles and woodland heavy metal are closer to Tom Waits’ discordant masterpiece Swordfishtrombones than the clean guitar lines of Out of Season. Gibbons also employs backing vocals for the first time, their sparing use bolstering, rather than radically altering, the album’s makeup, although the children’s choir and wobbly recorder on “Floating on a Moment” and “Beyond the Sun” give the two songs an unsettling air of innocence lost. The arrangements, largely by Gibbons and Ford, luxuriate in the slightly unreal edge of music once removed. Much of the instrumentation (for example, the sweeping, almost Middle Eastern string lines on “For Sale”) could have been written at any point in the last century, although the rejection of the snare drum’s rebellious crack nudges Lives Outgrown into a parallel universe where rock’n’roll never really took root. Verses are punctuated by wild brass skronk (“Beyond the Sun”) and violins scrape across the percussive surface like nails on a blackboard (“Burden of Life”). These leftfield choices underscore the courageous and subtly unusual nature of Gibbons’ album, which hides its eccentricity behind her deathless voice and sympathetic lyrical insight. Lives Outgrown may have taken agonizingly long to arrive, but it bears the mark of more than a decade well spent, a singular talent reborn in surprisingly spiky glory.

fantasy of a broken heart,Feats of Engineering,7.5,Rock,"While healthy relationships are built on the mundane, the juice is in the intense, indulgent world of fantasy. “Your entanglement with joy/Was not about her/Catharsis of the heart/Is a personal affair,” fantasy of a broken heart’s Bailey Wollowitz sings in the closing moments of their ambitious debut, Feats of Engineering. While heartbreak propels much of this record, it would be reductive to call it a breakup album. Wollowitz and bandmate Al Nardo subject the universal experience of lost love to a kind of psychedelic processing. Small moments kaleidoscope over each other, like Saturdays brightened by breakfast with Tony Danza, or chance encounters on the subway fringed with classical myth. Feats of Engineering is an electric dream state, where experiments in prog, pop, indie, and shoegaze combine to underscore the devastating realization that, with time, all romantic memories blur into fantasy. fantasy of a broken heart is an art-pop two-piece from Brooklyn. The duo splits vocals, songwriting credits, and guitar duties, while Wollowitz supplies some bass, piano, and drum programming. You’ll hear resemblances to Water From Your Eyes, Sloppy Jane, and This Is Lorelei—all groups Wollowitz and Nardo have each spent time playing in. The two met at Bushwick’s basement venue Heck, then cut their teeth playing at the Glove: two eclectic DIY spaces whose programming ran the gamut from gabber to stoner metal. Feats of Engineering is styled similarly, plucking the poppiest of melodies as freely as it changes time signatures. Think Prefab Sprout’s Steve McQueen with its honey-sweet hooks and shifting song structures, Microcastle-era Deerhunter with its driving downbeats and metronomic riffs. Notes, too, of Animal Collective’s cascading synthesizers and energetic vocal cacophony. They have the shameless ambition of an arena band with the musical chops of prog-rock veterans, underscored with a healthy flair for the theatrical. Feats of Engineering refuses to settle on a single set of styles. Each song follows its own logic as the record expands and contracts on a track-to-track basis. The uptempo indie pop of “AFV” is sequenced just before the bubblegum falsettos and glossy synths of “Loss.” “Tapdance 2”—which morphs from garage rock into a surf-rock-fringed take on the Fall into anthemic guitars and cymbal crashes—gives way to “Basilica,” a restrained ballad textured by Nardo’s upper register floating over chiming arpeggios that shine a melancholic light on their “holiest of hangovers.” Many lyrics offer a little wink; most of the production is maximalist. “Catharsis,” the nearly seven-minute odyssey that closes the record, is the finest example of how fantasy of a broken heart uses the studio to complement their songwriting. Wollowitz works their sincerest croon, waltzing over a twinkling piano. The narrator yearns to be released from heartache yet relents at the same time, questioning if catharsis is what they want after all. The song’s core irony—a narrator caught in a loop of “thinking about putting the girl that you love on a cloud” against a structure that throttles towards its own crescendo—encapsulates the way fantasy builds tension between their lyrics and instrumentations, juxtaposing stasis with movement. Between Wollowitz’s grand, reverb-washed exhortations, a brief but scorching guitar solo, and the song’s final thrashing chords, “Catharsis” makes comprehensive use of the band’s full arsenal, a fitting finale for their auspicious debut.

Throbbing Gristle,TGCD1 / The Third Mind Movements,8.0,"Electronic / Experimental / Rock Reviewed: August 24, 2024 By 1981, the great Throbbing Gristle were finished. The UK quartet—electronics whiz Chris Carter, queer visionary Peter “Sleazy” Christopherson, guitar hero/pocket trumpet enthusiast/sex-and-art-worker Cosey Fanni Tutti, and carnival barker-cum-cult leader Genesis P-Orridge—had swollen the boundaries between punk, psychedelia, disco, and musique concrète. Along the way they’d done what seemed like irreparable damage to each other’s ears, bodies, and hearts. They abruptly ended their tour and sent a transmission to their fan club: The mission was terminated. Then, five years later, they briefly flickered back to life with 1986’s TGCD1. The new-fangled compact disc—the format, launched in 1982, had taken off the year before—came tucked into a typically minimalist package emblazoned with their high-voltage flash symbol and complete with a written note from each of the four players. A new edition from Mute recreates the CD and splits the 42 minutes of studio recordings made on their TEAC 8-track onto two sides of vinyl. At their core, Throbbing Gristle were a jam band, though their idea of hippie dancing might have been stubbing your toe. Much of their ample discography, including the infamous attaché case of 24 cassettes, documented their long, frenzied improvisations. TGCD1 offers a pair of exegeses into classics from their album 20 Jazz Funk Greats. At the time, they might have sounded like autopsies. Today, they sound like a dangerous séance. The first side opens with seven minutes of noise, part cauldron and part plasma globe. There’s foam and fuzz, guitar shards invoking krautrock and Stockhausen and other brownish-gray takes on white noise. Then, with the brutal power of the slow-moving clock at the job you fucking hate, the grinding groove of “What a Day” begins. It goes on like this for the next 13 minutes, going nowhere but moving deeply, a daydream you resent yet need to carry on. The second part launches fully into space, then settles into long orbits around another 20JFG classic, “Convincing People.” P-Orridges’s madman/ad-man vocals are absent. But its 20 minutes sell you on the notion that Throbbing Gristle could have been a dance act, putting out 12"" megamixes for queerdos to find themselves to on the dancefloor. TG could have been Moroder, shooting their sonic wads for Freddie Krueger films instead of soundtracking Derek Jarman art-house experiments. They could have been huge, instead of hugely influential. They didn’t want to, though. They went on to bigger, often better things: Sleazy’s immortal Coil with his lover John Balance, icy-hot electro-pop outfit Chris & Cosey, P-Orridge’s trans-genre provocation engine Psychic TV. (But the former’s ill-fated Hellraiser soundtrack work and the latters’ dancefloor hits and misses proved the world would never really be ready for them.) And then, some 23 years later—and given their occult interest in numerology, that number couldn’t have been an accident—they reactivated again. Three surprisingly vital and viscous albums arrived, each recently reissued by Mute. Even more improbably, they played Coachella and New York City, the later dates with all house lights up so the crowd could be sure they weren’t imagining things. Among the T-shirts and enamel badges at the merch table, they could see something else: a compact disc called The Third Mind Movements. TG made that album’s eight tracks during a residency at London’s ICA in 2007, and while they lack the hooks and holy fury of the other post-reunion albums, the jams come thick and sweet. “PreMature,” “Secluded,” and “Not That I Am” slick P-Orridge’s whispers in echoes that flout the bounds of time and space, as if a voice could be heard before it’s listened to; the words, whatever they are, reflect on blood-warm pools of drone. Cosey’s voice seems to join P-Orridge on the shimmering “The Man From Nowhere,” an almost heavenly duet for two people who, over more than half a century and by their own accounts in opposing memoirs, went through hell with and because of each other. A trio of tracks serve as title songs, and also as retrospectives of what the band members had been up to in their time apart. Cosey’s pocket trumpet soars across the “First Movement,” reporting from the rough skies landscaping the worlds of recent Chris and Cosey records. “Second Movement” gurgles with the bubbly mindfuck P-Orridge kept attempting in Psychic TV’s rock period. And “Third Movement” achieves the fine bowel rattling of late-era Coil, complete with the back-alley jazz vibe. None of it is particularly alchemical. For much of the album, the sonics feel stuck in their own camps, as if waving to each other over battlegrounds too salty to sprout. The Third Mind Movement is wrung with trudges and grudges, united perhaps most effectively with the epic “Perception Is the Only Reality.” The beat is another scrape off the old “What a Day” barrel, the setting mostly just a filigree of feedback. Every now and then, it sounds like Sleazy squeezes a bit of juice from a knob; perhaps Cosey strikes one of her instruments as if throwing a lit match in a bucket of water, hoping it’s full of gasoline instead. This is improvisation as inertia, 10 minutes of four of the Western world’s most inspired artists spinning their wheels until they stopped. Sleazy died in 2010, and P-Orridge passed 10 years later. But TG live on. Oppositional as ever, they were brilliant at jamming together unstable emotions—here, at their end, curiosity and boredom. Nobody did any of it better.

Shellac,To All Trains,8.1,Rock,"To All Trains is a Shellac record. Expectedly, thankfully, obviously, unapologetically, unremarkably a Shellac record. A 180-gram Touch and Go Records—“made with 100% Recyclable Material which is PVC & Phthalates Free and uses 79% less CO₂ to produce”—Shellac record. Of course, the crucial difference with this particular Shellac record, their sixth, is that frontman Steve Albini passed away from a heart attack at age 61, just 10 days before its release. It’s hard to wave away the tragic circumstances clouding it, especially when it concludes with a track called “I Don’t Fear Hell” where Albini delivers the smiling-through-clenched-teeth lines, “Something something something when this is over/Leap in my grave like the arms of a lover/And if there’s a heaven, I hope they’re havin’ fun, ’cause if there’s a hell I’m gonna know everyone.” Yet To All Trains is not an album overcast by death: It’s just one more example of how someone chose to live their life. Leading Big Black, Rapeman and, finally, math-rock trio Shellac, Albini spent 40 years dedicated to a singular vision of underground rock music that was no frills, free of overdubs, constructed with analog tools and constantly nattering with guitar tone that started shrill and slowly evolved into Morricone metal. Eminently dependable, Shellac were the Honda Civic of alternative rock—modest, reliable, generally affordable. You knew the drill. There was a new album every so often, but never too often, whenever the mood struck prolific studio engineer Albini, prolific mastering engineer Bob Weston, and working drum instructor Todd Trainer. Most of the things that made Shellac a great band in 2000 and 2007 and 2014 were already firmly bolted into place on their 1994 debut, At Action Park: the growl ’n’ skwonk, the bludgeoning repetition, the best-sounding drums around. They’re still here, too. Unlike similarly minimalism-minded rock bands like the Ramones, Motörhead, or AC/DC, you never had to worry that Shellac were going to fall prey to the creeping influence of modern production techniques or genre trends. Shellac songs would vacillate between rancorous and caustic (2000’s “Prayer to God""), hypnotic and caustic (2007’s “The End of Radio"") or funny and caustic (2014’s “All the Surveyors”), but no one was ever going to file a complaint to the Better Business Bureau about the ingredients on the label. To All Trains naturally walks the same path and, had circumstances permitted, would likely have been appreciated simply as little more than Shellac’s sixth excellent record. At a lean 28 minutes, it’s their shortest and most instantly rewardable—no instrumentals and none of the longform post-rock indulgences of 1998’s Terraform or 2007’s Excellent Italian Greyhound. Elements of the Minutemen were always lurking in Shellac’s music, but they seem especially pronounced in the groove-spiel of “Chick New Wave,” the sharp pauses of “Days Are Dogs” and the pro-labor screed “Scabby the Rat,” which plays like a funnier, less anxious version of Double Nickels on the Dime’s “West Germany.” Like all good minimalism, the changes are small, so the highlights are subtle. The blown-out noise-rock coda of “WSOD” is outrageous, like a half-minute Brainbombs blast. “Days Are Dogs” is a cowbell-slamming Nazareth song for about five seconds. Albini’s guitar slowly distends like gelatin at the end of “I Don’t Fear Hell.” “Scrappers” stomps along as if Pussy Galore had bothered to learn how to play their instruments. Shellac’s lyrics are as cryptic as ever, so it’s fun to imagine the Weston-sung “How I Wrote How I Wrote Elastic Man (Cock & Bull)” as a belated clapback to the Fall’s Mark E. Smith, who playfully dissed Albini on “50 Year Old Man” in 2008. Shellac’s photorealist recording strategy and silence-heavy compositions mean there are lots of places to admire things like cymbal decay and snare drum ring. In fact, Trainer is probably the album’s MVP, thanks to his artful, muscular, musical little drum solos across many of the open chasms. To All Trains closes the book on the band and serves as a perfectly respectable epitaph; it’s exemplary, just like the five Shellac records that preceded it. The band’s legacy will blare on in noise-rock bands like Couch Slut, Chat Pile, Metz, KEN mode, Whores, and the Austerity Program. Weston will likely be mastering more of your favorite records, and it’s possible that some of your favorite new drummers will be trained by Trainer. Most importantly, Albini’s dogged, outspoken adherence to high-quality audio fidelity, equitable working conditions, and DIY grind will probably be an inspiration for some time, even as the very economics of “indie rock” are increasingly unsustainable for bands both new and veteran. This is a sad fuckin’ song, but it’s by no means finished. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Britney Spears,Blackout,8.1,Pop/R&B,"A woman drives fast along the California freeway with the radio screaming, delirious with grief. She does this every morning, dressing quickly in her Beverly Hills home so as to leave no time to think. Changing lanes is like a dance the way she’s trained herself to do it, seamlessly and to the beat. She walks barefoot into gas stations, rinsing down pills with warm Coca-Cola and chatting mindlessly with the attendants. Her marriage is over. Her showbiz career is dead. Her child has been taken away. She is known to cry at parties or get carried home; close friends have come to believe she’s insane. It is only on the freeway, when the music is loud, that she can forget what’s become of her life. To fall asleep she imagines herself on the road: “The Hollywood to the San Bernardino and straight on out, past Barstow, past Baker, driving straight on into the hard white empty core of the world.” How chic the story sounds the way Joan Didion tells it in her 1970 novel Play It as It Lays. The woman is a trainwreck but a sharp and glamorous one, numbing out on pills as a critique of moral rot in 1960s Tinseltown. Books are great that way. Played out in real life in the year 2007, the tale loses its cool; now the woman is a punchline whose endless personal disasters keep a burgeoning new media economy afloat. It seemed that every week, or sometimes even every day, brought a hysterical new headline regarding the downward spiral of America’s pop princess. (“HELP ME!” “INSANE!” “OUT OF CONTROL!”) “We serialize Britney Spears. She’s our President Bush,” said TMZ founder Harvey Levin in a gruesome Rolling Stone cover story from early 2008, which began with Britney wailing in a San Fernando Valley shopping mall as a crowd closed around her with their Sidekick smartphones brandished. “I don’t know who you think I am, bitch,” 26-year-old Spears snarled to a shopgirl approaching for a photo. “But I’m not that person.” What had become of the Southern sweetheart was not a symptom or appraisal of a new century’s decay but the foremost emblem of it, or possibly its cause. A New York Times essay that summed up 2007 as the year of the trainwreck, in which “prominent figures from every arena of public life did harm to their reputations and livelihoods in devastating fashion,” led with a description of Spears’ lifeless performance at the VMAs that fall. “Is there any measurable way to prove what many of us feel in our gut,” the article went on, “that 2007 was the year when the excesses of our most reliably outrageous personalities finally started to feel, well, excessive?” Or was it that the billion-dollar gossip industry, newly powerful online, had willed this chaos into being? It was the dawning of the era of perpetual surveillance, and websites once considered too sketchy to break news were scooping the “real” outlets when it came to all things shallow and macabre. It had been nearly four years without new Britney Spears music. She remained the defining figure of American pop culture, only what that meant had changed, and by then the image of the happy blonde from Kentwood, Louisiana, had been replaced a few times over. “Have you ever gone further than you wish you had?” Diane Sawyer asked the singer gravely on Primetime in 2003, whipping out the pages of a recent Esquire shoot which styled her in little more than a dozen strings of pearls. Its accompanying story, written by Chuck Klosterman, opened with the sentence, “Britney Spears is pantless,” and went on to conclude: “She is not so much a person as an idea, and the idea is this: You can want everything, so long as you get nothing.” On the cover she was made up like Marilyn Monroe, with whom she shared a knack for articulating her own myth with more profundity and wit than most smug writer types. In the years since her last record, 2003’s In the Zone, Spears had married a dancer from Fresno, gave birth to their two sons, negotiated a divorce, lost custody of the babies, went twice to rehab, shook off her management team, and spent her days hunted by cameramen through the gas stations, pharmacies, and drive-thrus of L.A. She also wrote a blog. For $25 a year, you could read the singer’s musings on the fearsome beauty of tigers (“their eyes, their stripes, their constant quest for survival”) or poems she’d written: “Manipulation is the key/They screw it in/Because you’re naive,” went one from 2006. Other times she’d weigh in on her latest dramas with good humor and startling self-awareness. “Recently, I was sent to a very humbling place called rehab,” she wrote in spring 2007. Three months before, she’d shaved her head bald at a hair salon in the Valley as the paparazzi snapped on. Headlines called her crazy, but she looked strangely serene. “It felt almost religious,” Spears described the moment in her 2023 memoir, The Woman in Me. “I was living on a level of pure being.” In a blog update from June 2007, Spears appeared in a cheap wig and elbow-length white gloves, posing like she might have circa Oops!... I Did It Again. “I’m asking my most die-hard fans for some assistance in order to name my upcoming album” the post read, presenting the following titles for fans to vote on: 1. Omg is Like Lindsay Lohan Like Okay Like 2. What if the Joke is on You 3. Down boy 4. Integrity 5. Dignity As a riff on her own image, it was better satire than the cheap shots at the star that pervaded late-night TV. In any case, she named the album Blackout. ⚜ ⚜ ⚜ In a ritualistic deflowering ceremony stretched out across three years, millions watched as Spears transformed from a shy schoolgirl to a sweat-slick jungle queen, writhing beneath a python onstage at the VMAs. I can’t count the times I’ve replayed these performances—1999, 2000, 2001—trying to articulate what made her such a star. Her melismatic voice, sung from her nose and not her chest, lacked the power of the divas of the ’90s, trembling instead with plucky naivety. But beneath her confidence and cheery disposition, the pathos of her best songs (“Sometimes,” “Lucky,” “Everytime”) always seemed to trace back to the loneliness of being misconstrued. “Notice me,” she whimpered on the first line of the latter. In the 2004 video, she drowns in the bathtub of a hotel room from injuries sustained in a paparazzi chase while a baby is born in a hospital nearby. Spears wrote the treatment herself. By September 2007, four years had passed since Spears’ last VMAs appearance, where a campy kiss with Madonna had triggered lesbian rumors and conservative talk show ire. Compared to the promo blitzes for her previous albums, she had so far done almost nothing to advertise the long-awaited Blackout, her fifth album to be released later that fall. Her performance of its lead single that would open the awards show was hyped as the equivalent of Elvis’ 1968 comeback special. “My team was pressuring me to get out there and show the world I was fine,” wrote Spears in her memoir. “The only problem with this plan: I was not fine.” Sleepless, under-rehearsed, and fresh off a backstage run-in with her ex Justin Timberlake, who’d take home more awards than any other artist that night, Spears had a panic attack. With messy hair and denim-blue contacts, she staggered around the stage, shimmying miserably to a song called “Gimme More.” “I knew it was going to be bad,” she described in the memoir. “I could see myself on video throughout the auditorium while I performed. It was like looking at myself in a funhouse mirror.” The camera panned the crowd: Rihanna stifled a giggle, 50 Cent arched a brow. Spears looked so tragic up there that I doubt too many viewers were paying much attention to how nuts the music sounded. Her voice stretches and smears and splinters, interrupted now and then by a man who sounded like Satan, or perhaps Dracula. It’s a song about surveillance in the guise of a song about sex, showing you how it feels when the two topics are entwined—a pole-dance number for the panopticon. “They want more?” she gasps over the beat’s zombified thud and the creepy oohs and ahhs of the spectral background choir. “I’ll give them more,” she promises, whispering it like a threat. At home, the song’s producer, Floyd Hills, watched, waiting for a sign: “Just give me that one pop to let me know you back.” The beatmaker better known as Danja had come up under Timbaland, the most influential producer of the century thus far; they’d shared credits on Timberlake’s 2006 album FutureSex / LoveSounds, which ran the charts and earned the former boy band member newfound cred. That summer, Danja had begun to work with Spears on the album that would mark his solo breakthrough, which she’d call in her memoir “the thing I’m most proud of in my whole career.” The producer had become obsessed with the dance music he’d heard in the nightclubs of Miami, a year before the Daft Punk tour that brought their French touch to the American mainstream in 2007. “Everyone was bouncing around to Benny Benassi’s ‘Satisfaction’ and Tiesto, literally in a trance,” Danja recalled of one night at Club Space. “I was like, that’s it. If my music doesn’t make you feel like that, what are we doing?” The Blackout sessions flowed without direction or distraction, with Spears estranged from her old team and unburdened by the notion of “pop.” “She might have been going through more in her personal life than what we knew at that time, and it got a little crazier when we were deeper in the project,” Danja said a decade later. Still, the crew of writers—among them Keri Hilson and T-Pain—were struck by the singer’s instincts. She knew exactly what a Britney Spears record should sound like at that time. “You would know how she felt about a song by pure body language,” said Danja. He stuck to beats that made her dance in the booth: “Something hard and edgy with hip-hop undertones. Once I realized that was what she wanted to do, that’s where I stayed.” A synth on the fritz, an animal shriek, and the slap of a bag of quarters on the folding counter of Hell’s only late-night laundromat: so begins Blackout’s second single, “Piece of Me,” the coolest song of Britney Spears’ career. “I’m Miss American Dream since I was 17,” she sneers, her voice thrown and refracted, sinking through Auto-Tune ooze into a beat from Bloodshy & Avant, the Swedish duo who’d helped her win her first Grammy for “Toxic” in 2004. You could simplify the song as a piece about the obliteration of selfhood as the cost of mega-fame, its decayed sound paired perfectly with its rotten subject matter. But that description makes it sound like Spears would play the victim. Instead she rolls her eyes, already bored with your obsession. “Piece of Me” is among the great works of American art about fame. But at the 2:08 mark, it becomes a masterpiece as Spears’ voice glitches, stutters, and doubles over the throb of a synth line as elegant as the 2000’s iciest grime. It is rightfully here that the careers of Charli XCX and PC Music begin, with music that still sounds like the future of pop 17 years later. Most critics at the time attributed Blackout’s radical sound to the non-Britney Spears names among its credits, where she is listed as executive producer. (“She has done almost nothing, in the recording studio or outside it, to convince fans that Blackout is really hers, or really her,” wrote Kelefa Sanneh in a New York Times review.) But in ways that anticipate Kanye West’s Yeezus six years later—the treatment of the human voice, the purpose behind each sound—such an alarming album on fame’s shattering potential could be made only by this artist at this moment. And what exactly did Blackout emerge from? Taking notes to write this piece, bullet points played out like a mid-aughts version of “We Didn’t Start the Fire”: “BIMBO SUMMIT / BLING RING / PORNHUB / WILL.I.AM / ROCK OF LOVE / CINESPACE// KIM K SEX TAPE / SOULJA BOY CRANK THAT / JUICY ON MY SWEATPANTS / DEADMAU5 / BLOGHOUSE / ANNA NICOLE SMITH” It’s the era’s naughty qualities that most stand out today. But the trashy-fun abandon never quite made it to pop, which still felt quaint beside the bacchanalian club rap and stadium R&B. (“It’s been boring,” Spears said in 2006 regarding the pop scene. “Nothing’s been wow to me.”) Cher’s “Believe” had brought Auto-Tune’s post-human sparkle to the radio in ’98, though songs by T-Pain and Lil Wayne that normalized the plug-in as an expressive tool were still mostly seen as gimmicks. Blackout took the concept further, going beyond naughty to feel genuinely sinister: a glimpse inside a life from which every bit of normalcy had been stripped away. “I’m crazy as a motherfucker, bet that on your man,” Spears sing-songs on Blackout’s weirdest song, “Get Naked (I Got a Plan).” The track buzzes like a lightbulb dangling from a string as Danja assumes the role of a maniacal wizard, smearing his cackling vocals across space and time. Spears’ chants and teases are stretched and pulled to the limits of what is recognizably human; still, she rides the beat. It’s a song about sex that makes you consider abstaining from it forever, and that’s before Danja slips into a terrifying trance, grasping mechanically at Spears like a demented pervert robot. The year before, Spears’ superstar ex had made a promise to bring sexy back. I listen to FutureSex/LoveSounds today and cringe, less for the pleasures of millennial misandry than for how purely wack it sounds when played next to Blackout. Why is it that Blackout sounds vital today where FutureSex sounds limp, though Danja’s fingerprints are all over both records? You could call it a vibe shift: FutureSex marked the end of Timbaland’s 10-year reign as urban radio innovator, while Blackout looked ahead to our synthetic future. (Timbaland’s slick beats in the late ’90s and 2000s conjured images of hoverboards and flying cars, but it’s the melancholy futurism of TLC’s FanMail that resonates today in its 1999 vision of lonely androids refreshing their inboxes.) More than that, Spears understood something Timberlake didn’t: Abjection is a powerful aphrodisiac, and desire requires a void. Venture too far down the rabbit hole of 2007 Britney cliché and you might end up at the idea of Blackout as an evil album, an exploitative document of a woman at rock bottom. The cliché extends to the well-intended but condescending coffee mugs emblazoned with the catchphrase “If Britney Survived 2007, You Can Make It Through Today.” But to view Blackout through a lens of victimhood is to miss how fun and wild the album can be. Irksome on the first few listens, “Radar” becomes addictive in its counterintuitive swing, her vocals just behind the beat like today’s rap avant-garde. On “Freakshow,” Spears raps in a campy-cool mode between Peaches and Fergie (“On some superstar ish, pushing hot Bugatti whips”) before her voice is chopped to smithereens as Bloodshy & Avant try their hand at dubstep wobbles. Even harder is “Toy Soldier,” an amped-up K-Fed sneak diss co-written by Sean Garrett, the pen behind Ciara’s “Goodies” and Beyoncé’s “Upgrade U.” (Call me crazy, but I hear glimmers of Azealia Banks’ “212” in its bratty bounce.) The only press Spears did for Blackout was a live radio interview with Ryan Seacrest that October. KIIS-FM had told her it would be about the record, until the questions began: Do you feel like you’re doing everything you can for your kids? How often will you see them? “It felt like that was the only thing that people wanted to talk about: whether or not I was a fit mother,” Spears remembered in her memoir. “Not about how I’d made such a strong album while holding two babies on my hips and being pursued by dozens of dangerous men all day, every day.” Still, she managed a quick mention of her favorite track: “Heaven on Earth,” the nearest Blackout comes to a love song. Its inspiration (Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love”) is all climax, but Spears works the other way, surrendering the final minute to freefall. “I falllllll off the edge of my miiiiiind,” she exhales, spiraling to a level of pure being. Where her previous CD booklets had arrived with gushing “thank you” lists, Blackout came with none at all. It was the first Britney Spears album without a No.1 debut when a last-minute Billboard rule change bumped the Eagles’ seventh album, sold exclusively at Walmart, to the top. Even the glowing reviews wondered whether this nihilistic album was by Britney, or about her. Why not both? Years later, a leaked email from Spears demanded co-direction credits for the “Piece of Me” video. “I am learning more and more to take charge of my own life for a change,” she wrote. “If that bothers you then go sign another artist.” (She signed off: “Cheerfully yours.”) “Do you feel out of control in your life?” asks an interviewer off-screen in Britney: For the Record, the MTV documentary on Spears’ “post-breakdown” life released at the end of 2008. That February, she had been placed against her will under the conservatorship of her father and former business manager, which would last for the next 13 years. “No, I don’t feel it’s out of control. I think it’s too in control,” Spears answers without pause. “There’s no excitement. There’s no passion. It’s like Groundhog Day every day.” The camera pulls in close as she wipes away her tears. “When did you last feel free?” the man asks later. “When I got to drive my car a lot,” she wistfully replies. “I haven’t been able to drive my car.” All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Taylor Deupree,Sti.ll,7.7,Electronic / Experimental,"Why remake a classic? Comparison to the original is likely to cast even an extraordinary achievement in a bad light. Or so thought the composer and engineer Joseph Branciforte when Taylor Deupree approached him with the grandly ambitious—or perhaps wildly misguided—idea to create an acoustic version of his 2002 album Stil.. That record was a high water mark of the glitch movement, born of the moment in the late ’90s when personal computers became home studios. Deupree endlessly looped a handful of electronic samples slightly out of sync, allowing tiny digital artifacts to phase in and out of time like a Steve Reich composition at microscopic scale. Stil. is remarkably warm-sounding and emotive for such resolutely digital music, but impossible to imagine being played by actual humans. And yet, on October 10, 2021, Deupree sent an email to Branciforte requesting just that: “not sure if you’re familiar with the album... it’s very very repetitive... and i’d want it all played... not played for a bar and looped in pro tools.” Branciforte reluctantly agreed—on the condition that he could back out if it didn’t work. Though it’s Deupree’s name on the spine of Sti.ll, Branciforte is the mastermind behind the scenes. Only after they began did Deupree reveal that he no longer had the mix files for Stil.. Branciforte would have to rely on the finished recording itself for his transcriptions, a daunting task that required painstakingly isolating different frequency ranges for each track. Branciforte then recruited an ensemble of expert instrumentalists to pull off his exacting scores, including Madison Greenstone, whose extended techniques for clarinet are largely responsible for the album’s timbral character, and Ben Monder, a guitarist whose initial response to the proposal was simple: “That is a terrible idea.” Let’s put those doubts and misgivings to rest. Sti.ll works. The track that convinced Branciforte to keep going was “Temper,” Stil.’s busy, gyrating, IDM-inspired third track. He set about transcribing it for clarinet, dividing it into 16 layers and meticulously notating each one (an example of his extreme precision: Layer 11, titled “beeps,” has a tempo of 56.48 bpm, a level of specificity likely not perceptible to the human ear and certainly not playable with any degree of accuracy). Greenstone replicated the song’s thrumming static and jittery clicks with a range of techniques. For one layer, she used the clarinet’s keys to create percussive thumps of bass, and for another she continually pushed water through the mouthpiece to simulate the track’s crackly undercurrent. The results were revelatory: This was “Temper,” but it was something else too, a contemporary classical composition of arresting beauty. The otherworldly hum of “Stil.” also gets a single-instrument treatment. Branciforte translated the piece for vibraphone, playing with different rhythms, mallets, and microphones. Once these layers are stacked, the track begins to hover, and then to float. Soon, the listener is levitating too. “Recur” is more complex and required extra instrumentation, including Christopher Gross on cello, Laura Cocks on flute, Sam Minaie on double bass, and Monder, now enthused, on acoustic guitar. It lurches along at two different tempi, sounding like a glitching CD even though played live. On Stil., “Snow/Sand” consists of a single loop repeated for 15 minutes, though its length changes throughout. The musicians on Sti.ll recreate this woozy effect through sheer attentiveness and patience, with chiming vibraphone and finger snaps marking the phrase’s shifting boundaries. If ever there were a time to loop a track in Pro Tools, this would be it. But the refusal to do so defines Deupree and Branciforte’s approach—there is no cheating here. So why remake a classic? Branciforte found out only after he’d finished recording. Sometimes, if you set out to do the impossible, you actually achieve it.",0,"May 18, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-deupree-still/
Hayden Pedigo,"Live in Amarillo, Texas",7.6,Rock,"A few songs into Live in Amarillo, Texas, Hayden Pedigo lays out a few flaws that other people see in his hometown. Out on the road, he says, he’s aware Amarillo has a reputation as a “flat, windy, hot, cold, brutal, and somewhat ugly place.” Yet the guitarist has dedicated many of his meditative pieces to what he’s called the city’s “hard-earned beauty.” He once told a local TV station that something he most appreciated about living there was the unique experience of standing in a field stretching to the horizon in every direction. “It’s almost like a small piece of infinity,” he said. His music seeks to capture that feeling, each slowly unfurling melody a chance to lose yourself in the vastness of a single moment. Live in Amarillo, Texas, recorded in December 2023 at the theater that houses the city’s orchestra, shows Pedigo’s playing at its most expressive and expansive. The record’s six instrumental tracks—some of which stitch together multiple songs—stretch his winding compositions into otherworldly journeys that place grave importance on each phrase and pause. Opener “Carthage” (originally from 2021’s Letting Go) demonstrates the emotional weight of such an approach. Pedigo coaxes delicate, dreamy melodies from a 12-string guitar, playing softly before they fade into silence. Another guitar line drifts across the room, purposefully quiet. By the time the song builds to its more labyrinthine figures, the piece has paused a handful of times, giving even the most gently lilting melodies a sense of unease: At any moment, Pedigo might recede into the shadows and fall silent. Pedigo presents some songs in more twisted and deliberately heavy forms than he ever has on record. In its original incarnation on Letting Go, “Rained Like Hell” was a stately acoustic piece that evoked the spiritual odysseys of Florian Fricke. The live performance is more frayed and unsettled, pulling slowly yet violently at the melodies, as if they were strapped to a rack. Pedigo has hinted at his affection for metal—he wore corpse paint in the “Letting Go” video—but this is the first time he’s conveyed it in his music. It plays like one of the frigid interludes that marked ’90s black metal albums, if any of those acts had been just a little more into the blues. Over the years, Pedigo has developed a reputation as one of experimental music’s most irrepressible pranksters. He’s trolled local businesses, posted goofy fits on Reddit until he was invited to walk for Gucci, and launched a bid for Amarillo City Council with a surreal, distorted camcorder video (he ultimately finished second to the incumbent). Live in Amarillo, Texas bears little trace of this side of his personality. In the between-song patter captured on the record, his mood is reflective and nostalgic, fitting the sentimental renditions heard throughout the performance. Pedigo’s studio recordings consistently illustrate his skill as a guitarist, but Live in Amarillo, Texas demonstrates his greatest talent isn’t technical fireworks. A glowing emotional core presents itself in these stretched-out arrangements and stripped-down moments, something raw and real that reveals itself with every breath and halting pause.",0,"September 17, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hayden-pedigo-live-in-amarillo-texas/
How to Dress Well,I Am Toward You,7.1,Pop/R&B,"For nearly 15 years, How to Dress Well has resisted simple pleasures. On Love Remains, Tom Krell’s 2010 breakthrough under the alias, he drowned R&B melodies in dense production, obscuring straightforward sounds with reverb, distortion, and disjointed lyrics about death and desire. Even at his most accessible, Krell’s approach to pop music has been outré. His two best albums, 2012’s Total Loss and 2014’s “What Is This Heart?”, twisted songs that Whitney Houston could’ve sung into skittery, ethereal gems, like imaginary Top 40 hits encountered in a dream. A skilled deconstructionist, he dismantles familiar forms and pop archetypes, repurposes their core parts, and uncovers labyrinths buried beneath. Krell’s latest album, I Am Toward You, is his first release in six years and undoubtedly his most difficult yet. He constructs an idiosyncratic world of field recordings and ephemera, muffled soul singing and glitchy guitar samples, mournful melodic detours and buzzing electronic drops. It’s frequently blissful and self-consciously beautiful, yet its hooks are elusive—you won’t find a new “& It Was U” or “Repeat Pleasure” here. Lead single “No Light” is dominated by a harshly distorted lead riff that offsets the magic of its dance-pop backbeat, the vocals overdriven to the point of erasure. Even when his choices are less abrasive and more tuneful—like the straight-line strutter “On It and Around It” or the hymnlike a cappella “The Only True Joy on Earth”—the songs have an opaque, hazy quality. They seem to creep their way to transcendence, as if they’ve been floating in memory and are just now announcing their presence. But like any How to Dress Well project, I Am Toward You asks to be accepted on its own terms, free from preconceptions. A number of breathtaking moments offer inroads to immediacy even during strenuously experimental stretches that otherwise may keep you at arm’s length. Krell uses his raw falsetto less than he used to but still deploys it to powerful effect on “nothingprayer” and “A Secret Within the Voice.” Standout “Song in the Middle” is a slow-building accretion of loops that evokes a surge of strong emotions—anxiety, longing, hard-earned optimism. “A Faint Glow Through a Window of Thin Bone (That’s How My Fate Is Shown)” features a string and piano breakdown that’s as moving as anything in the How to Dress Well catalog. Even in its quieter passages, I Am Toward You discards clean, predictable patterns to judder and zag with obsessive intensity. In an eight-page, 4000-word exegesis Krell wrote to accompany the album, he describes it as a “transcendental poetic effort of great contemplation, confusion, unknowing, and prayerfulness… populated by birds, stones, contingencies, confusion, God, and fate, which takes up the task of becoming oneself, the intergenerational transmission of trauma, the meaning and experience of art and music, the mediation of all of this by technology.” Krell's lyrics are as impressive as they are disorienting, crammed with social critiques, psychoanalytic formulations, poetic wordplay, Greek myth, and Bataille references. “I guess I once confused the German word for face with the word for history/Just change one little letter, see your fate in the mirror,” he sings on “Contingency/Necessity (Modality of Fate),” a meditation on the interplay between historical narrative and personal experience. Krell earned his Ph.D in philosophy in 2022, writing a 400-page dissertation on the possibility of non-nihilistic metaphysics. He has since spurned academia, saying he had “to leave academic philosophy in order to save the true value of philosophical life from the nihilistic jaws of professionalization.” He had a similar falling-out with the “music industrial complex,” as he calls it. After making 2016’s Care, a record his ex-manager insisted be more commercially viable (it was co-produced by Jack Antonoff), Krell grew disenchanted. While touring his most recent album, The Anteroom, in 2018, he realized he needed to “leave the music industry” in order to save “the sacred meaning of music for my life.” I Am Toward You feels like a decisive step away from institutions and industries where art and philosophy are packaged as commodities, with Krell reemerging refreshed into an artistic life free of compromise or creative constraint. The album may not foreground the sort of open-hearted melody Krell once penned with such astonishing ease, but in its insistence upon breaking open old forms to find new truths, it remains faithful to How to Dress Well’s inquisitive—and provocative—spirit.

Lip Critic,Hex Dealer,7.7,Electronic,"In their music video for “In the Wawa (Convinced I Am God),” New York four-piece Lip Critic play avaricious record label execs, who realize the band (also portrayed by themselves) has stolen their masters. With the execs on their tails, Lip Critic incinerates the CDs with blowtorches, rendering them nothing more than melted plastic. The video exemplifies how the band approaches creation: like a hydra, cutting off one line of influence only to sprout new strands to experiment with. On their debut record, Lip Critic throws everything at you—dance punk, digital hardcore, heavy noise—and see if it’ll stick. At just over 30 minutes, this is an album of endurance and pure adrenaline; the mayhem makes Hex Dealer an exhilarating listen. The band officially came together while studying at SUNY Purchase in 2018. The Westchester school boasts alumni like Mitski, so Lip Critic’s harsher sound immediately clashed with their more indie rock-oriented cohorts, sometimes literally; frontman Bret Kaser recalls an online post complaining about noise from their band practices traveling across campus. Lip Critic’s ethos resembles Death Grips in their raw, uninhibited performances, but their thematic interests also approximate a more raucous iteration of fellow Brooklynites Model/Actriz. On opener “It’s the Magic,” where Death Grips’ influence is most evident, blown-out percussion pounds against Kaser’s vocals, echoing DG multi-instrumentalist Zach Hill’s uncompromising, primal drumming on “No Love,” one of their most recognizable tracks. Hex Dealer is a loose concept album about predatory preacher-types who resort to snake oil tactics to fulfill their craving for control. In this world, everything is a means to gain power, a façade to mask these characters’ true depravity. They numb their emptiness with overconsumption; whether that’s brand new jeans on “It’s the Magic,” trips to the butcher’s shop on “Bork Pelly,” or creating the ultimate gas station hoagie on “In the Wawa.” The album is a master class in genre-hopping, running the gamut of drum’n’bass, hip-hop, and ska. It feels as though Hex Dealer is a litmus test; take Lip Critic as they are or not at all. When “Love Will Redeem You” breaks out of the gate with pitched-up vocals and anxious percussion, it seems things can’t get any more abrasive—and yet there are still 10 songs to come. “The Heart” immediately follows, the tempo accelerates, the drums get harder, and the noise gets thicker and more suffocating. The con man at the center of the song grapples with his vices, and punctuated by Kaser’s rapid yelps, he convinces himself that he hasn’t succumbed to corruption. Hex Dealer is as frenzied as it is hilarious. On “Bork Pelly,” the band hands over duties to the now-dissolved Philly grime duo Ghösh for a verse that sounds like something Baby Billy Freeman of The Righteous Gemstones would market to you: “Take this flesh and take this wine/It will all be yours/And you’ll all be mine/For three easy payments of $19.99.” The record starts cautious and distrustful, but ends with a smug shrug. “I never seem to win/I’m losing every day,” Kaser sings on “Toxin Dodger.” “So I’ll become the problem/That I refuse to change.” Like Frankenstein’s monster, Hex Dealer’s encyclopedic curation and roots might sound like a disaster. But that’s half the fun of it, and even when everything has gone to shit, Lip Critic still makes it sound like a party. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

che,Sayso Says,7.0,Rap,"Nonstop mind-numbing livestreams, engagement farming YouTube series, and infinite scrolling: These are the innovations of an internet-brain-rotted generation that craves constant stimuli. che, newly 18, understands this. Since his first album, closed captions, the rapper has capitalized on this knowledge by eliminating all empty space in his music, crafting dense, wall-of-sound orchestration that leaves no room to breathe. On his riot-inducing new album, Sayso Says, he delivers escapist party anthems whose maximalist sound masks a slightly hollow perspective. With the help of usual partner in crime natexco and a few other degenerates, che architects glitchy, fast-paced textures designed to spike dopamine and fend off melatonin with reckless disregard for the impending crash. It feels like being invited to your friend’s house when their parents are away for a weekend. Che abuses the freedom and loads up FL Studio with every erratic plugin, dizzying instrument, and obscure reference he can get his hands on. Listen to the scattered array of synths on “NUNCA HACER COCAINA,” which, in a different environment, could make up the quirkiest text tone ever. Or “GET NAKED,” where a Japanese vocaloid sample hangs in the background and goads che on as he teases plebeians for eating catfish. Over 17 tracks, it all adds up to a lot to process, but processing isn’t the goal. che’s here to provoke nerve after nerve and provide an #experience. Che’s woozy vocal maneuvers are something of a guide through the noise as he unfurls stuttered flows and TED Talk-style chants amidst the whirlwind of chaotic production. He’s essentially Costa from Project X, urging you to avoid anything that might ruin the high. On “Hex On My Chest, It’s Going Down,” he repeats motivational refrains (“It’s okay to be down, just get through it”) as a ticking time bomb of hi-hats and ragey synths lurk in the shadows. On other tracks, he disassembles pop filters and summons a childlike glee when flexing the capabilities of his armory and unleashing random digs at Lil Xan; it’s like watching a kid open presents on Christmas morning. The only time che slows down and contemplates is on the nightmarish ballad “Children Shouldn’t Play With Dead Things,” where, in a deafening glare of synth pads, he cries out until the signal gets lost. On closer “My Favorite Color Is Red,” his final magic trick is flooding his voice under a sea of fuzzy bass until a spooky echo of screams slowly dissipates. If che brought the same keen attention to detail to his songwriting that’s evident in his world-building, Sayso Says would feel fully realized. Most of the time, though, che’s filling up the lyric sheet with generic “Hollywood girls” and bland boasts about being “cooler than” some imaginary foe. Take a rapper like Ken Carson, for example, who has transformed his sound in the last year by sketching out his hedonistic Atlanta lair with newly playful imagery. Without a Google search, you’d never imagine che is from the same city. It’s clear on Sayso Says that che knows immersive atmospheres will always draw listeners in. But in order to keep them there, he’ll need to flesh out the finer points.",0,"September 25, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/che-sayso-says/
Perila,Jazz Plates,7.6,Experimental / Electronic,"Distance generates yearning. Ulla and Perila have been making music together for years, split between Philadelphia and Berlin, like two moons orbiting the same sonic planet. Jazz Plates finally brings the duo into the same room together, letting them luxuriate in mutual presence and exploration over two discs. It’s unhurried and effortless. While this is technically their third full-length together, it is the first they have made in complete spectral congruence. Records like LOG ET3RNAL and blue heater felt like extensions of the communities in which they were surrounded—West Mineral Ltd. and its mastermind Brian Leeds, the Berlin-based ambient-by-way-of-splatter-painting label 3XL, and, of course, each other. The oceanic gap between them was shrunk to the size of Perila’s bedroom, recorded in person and, Perila says, “in one breath.” Both artists, together and apart, are obsessed with space. United at last, they abandon blissful beauty for strange pockets of noise and harmony, overlaid in fascinatingly peculiar fashion. Jazz Plates sounds nothing like anything they’ve made before, even recently. It synthesizes the lo-fi solo guitar proclivities of Perila’s set me free into the Red Room-esque blues dirge of “cheese homework;” the glitchy hymns of It Means a Lot, Ulla’s record with Ultrafog, shapeshift into crackling, membranous jazz on “a josh outside the window.” Clarinet, cooing vocals, plaintive chords, and the sounds of logs and leaves swirl together as though independent of their creators. “glass containers,” the album’s longest track, is the pinnacle of the first half, a snow-capped peak peering from behind a horizon of rain-drenched conifers. Nomadic melodies dissipate rather than decisively end. Relishing the way the sounds unravel, the players simply hear the music in front of them and respond, finding conversational discovery in real time and creating intimate and hopeful atmospheres. Heavier sounds and ghostly approximations of percussion hesitate to appear until the C-side. Easing in with the morosely haunting “swӓb,” Ulla and Perila resist whatever beauty they had found previously, consumed by oppressive static and trapped within the room’s four walls. Multi-tracked vocals float by like wisps of fog, and the pointed sounds of guitar and bass clash as they soundtrack the nothingness that fills every inch. But even the harshest sounds are tempered by lighter elements: laughter rises above the noise of “cheese homework,” serving as a reminder of the duo’s joy as they craft these soundscapes. It’s difficult to sustain tension and momentum over 67 minutes of such unstructured music. The variety from track to track is subtle: The clarinet takes marginally different paths; beats take shape out of distorted thuds or drops of rain. Jazz Plates starts as an empty room before folding in on itself over and over again, like infinite interior-design origami. Despite an ending doused in anti-climax, Ulla and Perila craft a space that facilitates wonder. Ambient has a reputation as wallpaper music, but Jazz Plates is more reminiscent of the dust on the shelf, the rain on the windowpane, and the company kept that makes the space bearable, perhaps even beautiful.",0,"September 26, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/perila-and-ulla-jazz-plates/
Xaviersobased,with 2,7.6,Rap,"Nobody combines serrated rap and goofy hi-jinks like Xaviersobased. In “Pediatrician,” Xavier flashes back to his kiddie days watching Noggin at the doc’s office, wearing KidRobot clothing and a SpongeBob wallet in hand, while producer mag blasts some Satan-with-IBS low-end in the “terror bass” style. The surreal combo of cute youthful references and aggro intensity is bizarrely addictive. Adorned with just enough pretty keys and airy cymbals, it throws you into a blissed trance. While January’s Keep It Goin Xav felt like a triumphant celebration of the scene surrounding his collective 1c34, with 2 goes solo and injects this kind of dazed-yet-hyper rap with a new level of screwy psychedelia. Xavier teased with 2 so many times that it started to feel like it would never arrive. When the tape finally dropped last week, it was because someone leaked it. So Xavier just put it out himself, even though it wasn’t properly mixed yet. But this kind of crazed, barely-finished release moment is perfect for his music anyway, since it often has the feverish rawness of disheveled snippets. If 2021’s With felt like a demolition zone of abrasive distortion, this sequel is more like a laboratory gone mad. The woozy freakiness remains, but the spiky edge has been softened. Cavernous drums echo over lost-in-reverie synth keys and vocals laced with so much delay Xavier floats through the tracks like a benevolent phantom. His wispy flow on “You See Me” coils upward like he’s slowly ascending a spiral staircase into the clouds. Yet even at its dreamiest, shards of sadness poke through. “linda.mp3” feels like mourning and moonwalking at the same time. Warm rays of synth drape Xavier as he pleads with another artist to quit drinking lean. While the tape delivers a sizable supply of hypnotic delights, there’s not much in the way of wild surprises. nyli and xion’s twitchy-twinkly beat for highlight “what zit tooya” already appeared in a Nettspend and phreshboyswag song, and straightforward tracks like “jaded” and “Softer” sound like they could’ve been on any xaviersobased tape in the last few years. Xavier’s at his best when leaning into unstable, erratic confrontations, as on “Aight,” whose bassline brawls with the synths like Greek Gods defending Mt. Olympus. The track was produced by cranes and anarchy, a talented Florida teen who offers a glimpse of the next generation beyond Xavier: cosmically unhinged and glitch-wracked stuff that takes distorted rap as a starting point. Despite a lowkey surge in popularity since Keep It Goin Xav, he’s still disgorging tapes that feel like DIY community zines, packed with madcap thumbnails and an all-star roster of niche producers. Nothing is out of bounds: chitchat about studying in the “1c library,” sounds of mouse clicks, or heaven-high gurgles. Violent threats and moments of emo vulnerability collide with cover art of a scowling purple fish from SpongeBob named “Mr. What Zit Tooya.” As other new-generation SoundCloud upstarts dilute their sound for wider audiences, it’s sweet to watch someone who doesn’t give a fuck. Even if it doesn’t hit all the time, the vision is thrilling.",0,"June 12, 2024",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/xaviersobased-with-2/
Salute,True Magic,7.5,Electronic,"Cars and pop music: They’re quite literally built to go together. Enter True Magic, the Ninja Tune debut from Manchester-based producer salute. Engines roar to life and cheers crescendo with each lap as producer Felix Nyajo shifts effortlessly across French touch, glitchy house, jungle beats, UK garage, and soul samples. Traversing genres with a pop sensibility alongside a heavy roster of collaborators, True Magic recalls Settle, the career-defining debut by Disclosure (who are featured on “lift off!”). salute and longtime friend and executive producer Karma Kid inject each track with LED-lit momentum and joyriding ease. salute’s first full-length has been a decade in the making. In 2014, Nyajo relocated from Vienna to the UK, immersing themselves in the British club scene at a moment when the robust, metallic rhythms of future bass pioneers like Hudson Mohawke and Rustie dominated. That tectonic purple sound influence—chip-tune buildups pieced together with sludgy bass hooks—was audible in early salute releases. Since then, Nyajo has ironed out the aggressive drops, smoothing their style into what they’ve called “fast and soulful house music.” They’ve performed for Boiler Room crowds and worked alongside modern-day pop hitmakers (the 1975’s George Daniel) and fellow rising producers (DJ Boring, DJ Seinfeld, Barry Can’t Swim). Four Tet is a fan. True Magic demonstrates the extent of salute’s evolution. Its songs are sculpted around glowing ’80s synthesizers, nodding to modern nostalgists like Daft Punk, Alan Braxe, and Kavinsky. The sleek, Weeknd-esque “Maybe it’s u,” featuring vocals from Scottish producer Sam Gellaitry, has the propulsive punch of Discovery and some of Ratatat’s cheese-grated guitar. Blending gritty bloghouse with elements of UKG, drum’n’bass, and jungle, salute emulates the aura of past hits without ripping them off. The results showcase their curatorial skill, fitting each track to their guests’ strengths. Empress Of’s satin vocals are the perfect vessel for romantic longing on “one of those nights”; piri’s cherubic tone in “luv stuck” is matched to bubblegum house on cruise control. Nyajo locates True Magic’s inspirations in vintage Japanese car advertisements, a colorful, frictionless style of clip that matched shiny new automobiles to sentimental pop soundtracks and fuzzy graphics. A sample of the Japanese jazz fusion group Casiopea’s song “Asayake” on the intro nods to a similar time period, but salute doesn’t linger: They swiftly transition to the rubbery bass of “saving flowers,” with Rina Sawayama. It’s as satisfying as running a series o f green lights. The front half of the album’s French house tilt is abruptly (and thrilling) interrupted by “go!,” featuring Japanese rapper Nakamura Minami, whose high-energy, hyper-animated style previously landed her work in the racing game Need for Speed. True Magic’s concept resembles a race, but at the end, salute counterintuitively eases off the accelerator. On the dreamy closer “drive,” singer LEILAH softly urges us to “drive faster,” even as the tempo seems to slow, and salute braids a hypnotic daisy chain of “la la las” into a glitchy house beat. Then a robotic voice calls us abruptly back, warning, “You will now return to the real world.” The unsettling closing note snaps the reverie: Like in the slick fantasy of those car ads, True Magic never needed a destination or a finish line. All the better to enjoy the ride. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
